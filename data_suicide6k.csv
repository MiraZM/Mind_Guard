"I've tried everything Medication, hospital, psychiatrist, psychologist, I can't find anything or anyone that can help me. I'm a burden to my parents because I need expensive health stuff and I can't get a job because of my severe depression. I just want it to end. I just want the pain to go away. I can't find a reason to live anymore. Where I am feels like hell so death can't be worse. I'm just scared of painful deaths and I don't want my family to find my body. I can't get a gun where I live.I don't know what to do. I've made two suicide attempts in my life yet I feel like I'm at the worst place I've ever been. Please help",1
I am uselessI have to preface this with the fact that I have Asperger's. I just cannot function in the presence of new people. I always find a way to fuck it up. The only socialization I get is at a weekly group that I have been going to for years. I cannot speak to anybody I don't know unless I am so drunk that I will not remember it the next day. And all my former friends are leaving the state. So I literally have zero friends. And it has become next to impossible to find new ones. Maybe I'm better off dead. No more cares about being lonely or having panic attacks at the prospect of being around people I don't know.,1

RITA CASTILLO IS COMING",0
"My fate is sealedAt this point I’m not sure if I should be happy, sad, relieved, shocked, or any emotion really. I’m just numb and it’s been that way for a while. Numb or sad, numb or mad, numb or anxious. I go from not feeling anything to feeling everything and then nothing again. It’s infuriating. 

But enough with that. Good news is: my mom bought a gun, a glock to be precise. And that means, it’s only a matter of time better I shoot myself and get done with all of this nonsense. 

See, I’m a minor (16 m) and nobody in my household knows I’m depressed. Since I’ve been my entire life, the progression seems natural enough for them to assume I act like how I should be at my age without any mental illness. To be fair, I play the part well, I don’t let them see when I’m sad or in a depressive mood and instead I isolate myself when it’s too hard to control. I’m also a naturally funny person and apparently a damn good actor, because nobody can tell I’m depressed unless I let them. 

“You don’t have to take the mental health survey because you don’t seem to be the type who’d be depressed anyway.” —&gt; a quote from my doctor, who I proceeded to affirm her misjudgment by laughing and cracking jokes. 

All I’m doing is waiting for a few things: 1) all of my family to be out of the house, preferably with the dog, 2) I’m researching ballistics and how the gunshot will impact the surrounding and have narrowed down my spot to two locations, my bathroom shower or the unfinished portion of my basement, 3) a particularly depressive mood where I won’t back out at the last second

So far, every since she bought the gun, all I feel is numb, or when I’m sad it’s like now where it’s late at night and everyone is asleep. 

There’s this sort of calm now, I don’t have to sneak out of the house and by a rope and calculate the drop height, which would put me in a position where my neighbors can see me, and I’m not trying to traumatize some kids, so that’s good. 

I don’t have to keep trying to starve myself for three weeks so I can die, because I never end up doing it like I should. 

I don’t have to memorize train schedules and plan sneaking out of the house and laying on the tracks. 

I have all I need at home and all I need to do is load it, cock it, and pull the trigger. 

The usual methods of easing tension have long since stopped working; music doesn’t help, writing doesn’t help, my dog marginally helps, but she’ll get over it. Plus, I can’t have a guilty conscience when I’m dead. 

If there is a God up there, suicide condemns next to Hell, to burn and be revived to burn over and over again for all of eternity. I am okay with that. If there is not God, my existence will be snuffed from the Earth and that will be that. 

I can’t talk to anyone, I’m just a burden. My family has a huge stigma against depression and suicidal ideation, those people are weak and it’s natural selection anyway. I’ve come to agree with that. Not that I judge this sub; I’d give my life for any of you in a heartbeat. Their criticisms only apply to me in my mind, and if you’re on the sub reading this, I am truly sorry, seek the help that I couldn’t and take my pitiful existence as a guide of what you shouldn’t do. 

As for friends, I’ve told a handful or so. Going chronologically, one doesn’t talk to me anymore, one probably forgot, one said she’d talk to me later about it but never did, one was mildly concerned but never did anything, one is reliable and consistently offered support, but I can and will never take them up on the offer (they have their own slew of problems to deal with), and one is kind and understanding but never pursued the topic as much, not that I ever gave them any inclination to do so. 

When I die and whoever finds this and reads it who knew me personally, don’t take offense to this. Everything that happened is by my design and I am, if not anything else, particular persistent in pursing my own demise. 

I’m sorry, Mom and Dad, for wasting your time, money, resources, and whatever else in my relatively short time alive. 

I’m sorry, to my sister, for this jackass move in about to do. 

I’m sorry, to the friends I told, I don’t want to name names for both anonymity and mental weight, you (should, kinda) know who you are, but I won’t leave you to feel guilty the rest of your lives. Move on without me, forget about me.  I’m sorry I told you, I never wanted to hurt you this much, I promise that anything you did made me feel alive in my time on Earth, and there is nothing you could’ve done to stop this outcome. Delay, sure, but I was always going to go out on my own terms. 


I’m sorry to friends I never told, I promise you I was still close with you, and I trusted all of you. It’s more of a me thing, to tell is to burden with knowing, and towards the end I’ve realized the less people I burden the better, because this was inevitable, it would only hurt more if you knew. 

I’m sorry to those I promised to that I wouldn’t do this, that I wouldn’t hurt myself, that I’d stay alive for them. I am, admittedly, a bastard and a ultimately cowardly and selfish human being. It’s not that I didn’t value the optimism and promise, and it’s not like I have anything to defend myself with. I just fucked up, and will pay for it for the rest of my life (get it?). I’ll either burn in Hell or cease to exist consciously, either way, you can curse me to the end of your days. So you better fucking stay alive enough to spite me. 

They would have a day at school where they’d give everyone time to grieve if we still had school. I’d wager that this information won’t reach most in the world’s current state; there are much more pressing matters at hand and I’m hardly a worthy conversation topic. Maybe I’ll get a hashtag, that would be funny. But I can’t say if it’s the laughing, happy funny or the sad, pathetic funny, I’ve had a lot of trouble differentiating anymore. 

Don’t judge me on what I’ve subbed to, partook in, whatever, they were but temporary means to combat against the infinite, oppressive, unholy darkness that lurked within. A candle in a storm, fighting fiercely and flickering until it is consumed, extinguished by a primordial, primeval force of nature . Dramatic right? If this wasn’t so serious, I’d bet you’d be laughing your ass off. 


My final message, one last favor I’ll burden you with: Reach out to people. Most of the conversations in my life I’ve had to start. I’ve always been the one to make plans, to text first, to try and keep the connection alive. Well, with this whole depression thing getting worse by each day, I gradually reached out less and less, and became a lot more isolated. As a result, I talked to people less, because with me to drive the conversation, nobody did. 

Now, to my friends who read this and think “But I did text him first” or are debating in their heads about if this is directed at them, know that I cherished every conversation I had with you, no matter if it was you or me who initiated it.  

Back to my favor, preferably it’d be everyone who you’d reach out to. It doesn’t matter how comfortable you are with them, it doesn’t matter if you haven’t talked to them in forever, the worst that can ensure is an awkward conversation, essentially meaningless in the grand scheme of things. You don’t understand how much that conversation can mean to them until it’s too late. 

There’s never a good way to end this. This will be messy, this will be rough, this will hurt. 

There’s so much I can talk about, I’ve been depressed my sixteen years, I’ve wanted to kill myself for as long as I can remember. I had dreams too, I wanted to be an author, a creator, someone inventive and clever enough for someone to take a look at something I’ve done and be like “this is my favorite ____”. Maybe then I could be proud of myself. 

But my creativity has never been harnessed, embraced, or fostered. It is as fleeting as the happiness I’ve felt and as unpredictable as the mood swings that follow my condition. 

I wanted to be an inventor, I wanted to change the world, to have the world know my name and know that I have changed something. Maybe my literature (or other creative endeavors ) could’ve helped someone out of depression, helped them exist in a world that they’ve convinced themselves they don’t belong in, or to allow them to escape to one that doesn’t carry the pain of the real one we live in today. 

But, as tragic as it may be, that will never happen. Writing has never been a career option for me, and I’m supposed to thank my dad later for that. I really don’t know how. 

As and suddenly and violently as my own life was snuffed, so follows this note. For I, the candle in the storm, have grown tired of drafting and rewriting; to perfect a facsimile for my shame, my guilt, my sorrow, my exhaustion, my anxiety, my worries, my doubts, my depression, my life. 

And as Robert Frost conveyed oh so beautifully, I will never know the road not taken. I will die alone, will it be in pain? Will it be instant? You will never know and I’ll take that secret to the grave. 

As morose and morbid this note has become, the sheer catharsis provided is what keeps me from ending it. To know that I finally have a way to escape myself is both a relief, a blessing, and a curse. I am relieved and terrified. Euphoric and miserable. 

The universe is calling my bluff, it put the gun on the table, after all my years of wishing for release, it is so close. As simple as a twitch of a muscle, a pull of a trigger. 

All is by design, all is by intention, and we’ll know one way or another the result.

I know that most of you won’t read this, I know that nobody will comment, I know that the length of this is a task that none will undertake. And I’ll be alone once more. 

It’ll finally be over. 

And maybe then I will find rest. 

I’m sorry. 

Truth be told, I don’t want to submit this. I’m terrified. This has become my imaginary respite, this is what distracts me from the real world and as soon as I lay my final period to rest, I embrace my torment once more. 

But sometimes you have to swallow your fear, sometimes you have to just do and stop thinking, sometimes you have to pull the trigger. 

There is so much more I can write and apologize for. If you can think it, so have I, and I’m sorry. Forgive me. I won’t die absolved of sin, but I don’t deserve to hide from myself anyways. 

I would leave you my name to remember me by, but I can’t risk someone finding this prematurely. 

You know who this is.  

I’m so sorry. 

I don’t want to go. Which is contradictory to this entire piece. I don’t want to die, I just don’t want to be me, to be alive and suffering is perhaps the worst curse of all. 

But night and day, life and death, are twins. Two sides of the same coin. One cannot exist without the other. 

This is my final goodbye. Thank you for all you’ve done. 

I’m sorry.",1
I need to say that I hate to listen to music from gnt that has already died. I find it mt bad vibe. Crying I already found it depressed but dps that he died the song was almost a suicidal anthem. Are you like that?,0
"Could use someone to talk to.27m here, I've posted in the sun before but I'm an Army and Army reserve vet who deployed to Afghanistan about 6 years ago. That's definitely the reason for my PTSD which I'm okay with and thankfully know good coping skills, but lately I've just been so depressed. It's so fucking draining and I keep coming to the point in my mind where suicide is the answer just to make it stop. In the past it was hard for me to cry but now I cry almost every night. I still have close friends where I'm originally from and still live, but now I don't know what to think. It makes me feel like I'm toxic. It seems like I'll either try and make plans and people can't or don't want too, or when I am. Invited to do something, it's going out to the bars. Which I enjoy, I just know I shouldn't drink at this time, it just makes me feel worse. J normally love being social, but lately I could care less. This has effected my appetite, sleep and social life and I am just so fucking done with all of it. Despite all of that, I really love this sub because of how comforting It is to be able to relate. Yeah I'm also in therapy and on meds, but sometimes just talking to someone who gets it feels.. well really helpful.",1
"Everything is always the same, nothing changes. Nobody actually sees me.So many ups and downs. Will going to school fix my future? Why are you depressed if you ""have"" money? Why this, why that. My boss treats me like an incompetent idiot, and all I want to tell her is that I'm proud of actually making it to work that day without turning my car around and completely ruining my chances at a decent resume. Like the resume matters. Here I am, posting to this reddit page because I'm desperate as hell for someone to understand me. To understand that I don't know why anybody lives in the first place, when life is the same every day - over and over again. The threat of my health condition constantly over my head, my grandmother slowly losing it and no parents to be found. I have an amazing fiancé, and I'm glad that he doesn't understand. I'm slowly losing my mind, and I can't wrap my head around staying in this world forever on repeat. It just doesn't make sense. I don't see a point in doing anything at all since it's just going to mean nothing. 

I feel invisible.",1

"I'm tired of this cycleI'm 30, have a great job, a loving fiance, am in the process of buying a house, and yet I hate myself. Last night I saw a doctor and started the process of ""getting help"" again. The last time was December of 2016 after a family member committed suicide. I took the pills. I felt better for awhile. The referral psychiatrist saw me once then blew off my follow-ups (with one month waits between each subsequent cancellation). The meds stopped working. The negative voice in my head came back. I quit the meds and tried to manage it alone. (I don't have a family doctor.) It went as well as expected.

I've been in talk therapy for 6 years with no diagnosis or sense of why I'm this way. I'm not convinced talking is helping anymore. $120/hr sessions to talk about B.S. is losing tangible value. Talking about how anxious I am over trivial crap and how awful I always feel doesn't stop me from feeling that way. There is no relief. 

I know I've made some progress. I'm aware of my episodes into misery and self-loathing--can calmly identify them. But that's it. I'm still a garbage person who can be an asshole. I project my outward misery onto the people close to me and drive them away. Talking about it doesn't change what I am or how I feel.

I just received an email from a now former friend who ghosted me, telling me I made them feel bad. I wish they would have told me. I never intended to make them uncomfortable. Whenever I felt like a joke went to far, I apologized and checked-in. I'm devestated that they felt this way and that I'm the cause of it. It feels like I'm always the cause. I've thought about suicide a lot these last few months. I have impulses on my morning and evening commutes to step in front of the train. This latest failure seems to only cement the belief I already hold about myself: I'm the problem.

I don't see any positive impact left by me. Just ugliness. And exhaustion. I'm so tired all the time. I know there's an imbalance somewhere, assuming this time ""getting help"" goes somewhere other than another dead end. But even if I do, how do I live with the wake of shittiness I've left behind me? When you've been the problem for so long, does it matter if you find a solution?

Today I took a sick day. I have no plans to self-harm. Just self-care. And drink, I guess. I feel alone, and broken, and hopeless. But what else is new? Feeling not-like this is the aberration. I just... Something has to give. I need to stop being this way. Stop projecting my anger, unhappiness, and fear onto the world. I just wish I knew a way that isn't giving up.

Because I really want to give up. ",1

How to help my fianceMy fiance was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes a week before his 18th birthday. He is now almost 21 and was extremely bad at taking care of his diabetes. Now he already has neuropathy and severe stomach cramps and I have just caught him choking himself. I don't know what to do or say since the damage to his nerves is permanent and won't get better. The rest of his life he will have to deal with the pain and I don't know what to say to comfort him. I'm so afraid that he might end his life because the pain will not be getting better. Please any advice is welcome I just don't know what to do at this point.,1

I’ve gotten ugly and disgusting over the past few months because I’m too miserable to keep up with hygiene. I’m failing school because I have no motivation. I have no real talents anymore - everyone’s caught up to me in the things I used to excel at. I feel like everyone at school laughs at me behind my back for being weird. I don’t have a dream job. I don’t have a dream life. All I want is peace - to not have to do this anymore. I can’t seem to give a single shit about anything anymore - except her.

"It's still there, but I realized the hypocrisy in my suicidal ideationTo not waste anyone's time with all the reasons I have for wishing I was dead, mainly because I'm not sure I know all of them, I'll cut to the main and most important one.

I feel like I'm a burden to the world, and to the people I love.

I've always seen my dad as a Saint, willing to stay with me, when my mom didn't. I didn't exactly make it easy for him, being autistic. He suffered through a kid who didn't like to be hugged, as well as a secondary abusive relationship, in an attempt to make my life as comfortable as possible. He still loved me, more than he loved himself. He is the only person my dumbass brain cannot convince itself, is lying when he says he loves me. 

My reasoning so far has been that if I we're never born, his life could have been better. He always wanted to be a captain on some ship, sailing around the world. I can't change the past 19 years, but I can make his life easier from now, by ending mine. 

It wasn't until recently I realised that if I actually do kill myself, it won't make life easier for everyone. Maybe most people I know, but not my dad. The last 19 years of his hard work will be wasted, unless I do something with it. All his sacrifices will be out the window, and it would be my fault.",1

"Ten years of abuse and all I can think is that maybe ending my life will open their eyes  It's been almost ten years since I was first raped at 13. From 13 to 16 I was raped and emotionally abused. Since then, I've done a lot to try and recover, try and trust again, try to love and be loved.
For a while it worked, I've tried again and again to let people get close and to I've tried to love, but every time I do, my lover leaves me or cheats on me. 
Two years ago, I was pregnant but didn't know until I miscarried, and it took a serious toll on my mental health when the would-be father stopped talking to me. It took about a year before I opened up again. 
In October when I did finally feel like I was in love again, I found out I pregnant with twins and I had an abortion. A week ago, the would-be father of that pregnancy stopped talking to me out of nowhere, with no explanation. I finally broke down and contacted one of his best friends to ask if he was ok and he told me that his daughter was born 3 days ago. He hid it from me the entire time. 
I've tried so hard to march on, putting my baggage beside me but after 10 years of constant abuse I just want to die. I can't imagine a future where this doesn't repeat itself over and over again. 
And just maybe if I were to kill myself, maybe they could see the impact that they've wrecked on my psyche. 
I'm in so much pain and I can't cope anymore.

"matter over mindi’ve thought about this for some time. these are really just undeveloped theories, but they seem to make some sense.

first, this premise: people hate responsibility and will avoid it at all costs. 

• why are mental issues stigmatized? people don’t want to be responsible for you.

• why do people brush things aside? avoidance of responsibility.

• why is it that when someone does ctb, a party is thrown in their remembrance? people hate responsibility, and by praising the dead, they avoid it yet again. surely, if one praises the dead and lauds them, they never could have been at fault or a contributing factor, yes?

thus, every one is self-centered. no exceptions, but people cannot be blamed for *be-ing*.

• then there’s crying wolf. just shut up or do it, yeah? no one is a winner with this point. . . i mean, they’re not actually gonna &gt;!*oh fuck they actually did it*!&lt;

even in the common sentiments such as “it gets better” or “get help”, there is the slightest notion of responsible avoidance. just get them help, they’ll fix themselves. . . right? maybe the only one that makes sense outside of this context is “stay alive”. no reason, just do it.

i guess i find myself asking, why care? that extends to myself, even.

second, a problem is not a de facto problem - it is a problem because it is *considered* one. therein lies the truth: opinions are the very constitution of a problem, and not the problem itself. it is a mental judgment of a thing that causes distress, and not the thing itself.

i dunno. too much self-absorption on my part with all this. too much introspection. not enough, though. still don’t know what that is. just another text wall, then.",1

"I'm tired of myself after all the failed relationships...I thought I'd be married by now, I thought I'd be doing memorable things with someone I truly loved by now.. I thought life was going to be so much different then it is now... I am so tired of being mean for no reason online... I'm so built up with hate for myself I spew it to others who don't need it... I am so tired of wanting to be in love but being afraid of being close... I always lose the person I'm interested in... fuck life. :(",1
"I know what's wrong with me, but I can't fix it. I'm so tired of living like this.My brain orientates towards offing myself in every moment. Fucked up a sentence? Visualize doing it. Keep staring at myself in a Zoom call and now everyone must think I'm a vain piece of shit? Throw in the towel. You get it. It's exhausting. And it's *every* *single* *time* I open my big mouth. 

My social anxiety is the biggest obstacle for me, second would be either my vanity or my disorganization. I know what's wrong, I'm deeply unhappy with myself and my inability to be alone but I can't make friends. Every opportunity I get, I just.. lose interest entirely.  I don't feel like talking to them, I think they are stupid or shallow, and then later I beat myself for thinking this way. I'm the shallow and stupid one for thinking that way. The only relationships I have in my life is with my mom, half-brother, and boyfriend- the first two don't really have a choice, they love me too much out of blood ties and the last is fucking me, so he puts up with my shit as well. Everyone else I'm incapable of relating to, either because I'm just too weird, or just not captivating enough. I'm smart, but not funny, brave, or strong, and my memory is too bad to contribute significantly to conversations. I'm just not enough. I wish I could just be nonchalant and live as myself, not needing anyone to validate me, but I can't and it fucking kills me.

I'm in college right now, taking 18 credit hours on top of working at a restaurant. Tomorrow was the one day I was looking forward to- I had an appointment for my first tattoo as well as attending a conference for the one club I have time for. But life did what life does, and my roommate tested positive so I cancelled everything. I'm going to attend the conference via Zoom but it's just not the same. 

I'm behind on my readings and have zero motivation to catch up or do any current assignments. I just don't care anymore. I was in a really low place just before the pandemic and I'm feeling myself slip  again. The problem really lies with my indecision and cowardice. I know how to do it, but I'm too scared... of what? Failing and being a vegetable, for starters. Losing her youngest child would kill my mother. I would send her to an early grave and no one would forgive me. I don't want my roommates finding me either. 

Being a coward is exhausting!!! Being ME is exhausting!! And I can't talk about it with anyone because I can't relate to anyone!!! My boyfriend just ends up talking about himself and I know what he's going to say already, and it doesn't help!!!!! I don't know what I want. I don't know if I would rather give up on a professional career and a ""normal"" life with friends and parties and just run away to a cave in the woods.... but I would be stuck with the person I hate the most. So should I do it??",1

"life in decay""graduated"" with a cs degree three years ago, I was hoping to get a job and be independent, so I can get some help for my condition

had to go to hospital for suicide plans, got my condition force fed to me everyday by hospital staff... awful.. can't disclose, I know how they treat people like me

Learned very quickly that I'm not qualified for anything, after getting a retail job, it became clear to me that I would start to fail to keep up with expectations, left while on good terms. Couldn't work full time without freaking out and cutting myself. Can't start on therapy again because of insurance issues, which I need in order to look for work again (required for job seeking help).

There's no escaping my parents, there's no getting access to any treatment, I'm trapped, the only way out is death or 14 hour shifts, no life, no friends, no family just endless exploitation or severe suffering shortly followed by death on the streets. Just existing a ""comfortable"" cage.

Just everyone force feeding me my deformity. It's so hard interacting with people, they're so super toxic. Why?! It must be me, I'm a terrible person, perhaps this what I deserve, though I'd argue I deserve far worse.

thanks for listening

"Trapped and quickly reaching the end of my optionsI have battled depression for almost my entire life. I have PTSD because my parents were abusive monsters on top of that. 

I have tried a slew of drugs. And for many years one helped me through. It didn’t make me happy but provided a reasonably high floor. But that drug has become less and less effective over the past 2 years. I have been clinically depressed for almost year straight. 

I am finishing up a trial for a new drug, but while it’s effects are quick, they are not long-lasting. Not a viable option, long term. I am now moving on to TMS, which is partially covered by insurance but will still cost me over $1,000 out of pocket. ($1000 I don’t really have) I am told my next option would be ECT (electro-convulsive therapy) which is hardly ideal. 

I just want to go to sleep and not wake up. I can’t seem to stop feeling bad, so I just want to stop feeling anything. 

But I have two beautiful kids who would be devastated if they lost me. They are the only reason I push on. But it is becoming harder and harder to stay. 

For now, I will push on. Hoping the next treatment is the one that finally works. 

I feel trapped. I feel sad. I feel empty. 

I want to die. ",1

My life would basically be going to the doctor for because I can't function without them and probably gonna need medication and maybe even become physicaly disabled if things get bad enough. That is not what I want. I want to set free my consciencousness from the sufferings of just existing.

"I need everything to stopI don't know what I'm supposed to do.
I'm a junior in college and I still don't have anything I'm good at or want to be doing. I'm waiting all my time and money and energy just going through it but my family won't let me drop out. But even if I did leave, what then? I have 4 work study jobs to try to keep myself afloat but have never been able to secure a job outside of school and still have hardly anything saved up. My only friends are at school, and they live across the country when we're not there. I've nearly failed out of school 3 semesters in a row now and I don't expect this upcoming one to be any different. I can't function properly, I barely eat, and only leave my room for class and work. I've just never had anything to look forward to and regardless of whether I somehow graduate or if I finally drop out, there's nothing waiting for me afterwards. Outside of that, literally nothing in my life ever goes right. I haven't allowed myself to get excited about anything in years because it always, always goes wrong, often in the most unpredictable ways. Even my friends have noticed and completely agree that I'm a fucking living personification of Murphy's Law. I can't ever catch a break and I'm so, so tired. Take all of this and add on a shit ton of unresolved trauma that I still relive in my head every single day and that state of the world in general and it's really not hard to see why I've wanted to die for so long and now feel like I won't make it to February. The one and only thing keeping me alive is knowing that some people would be very upset and blame themselves if I killed myself, and I'm seriously contemplating cutting ties with everyone I know so maybe they won't be as upset. I never thought I'd make it past 15 years old, never mind where I am now, and have just been going through life entirely blind because what's the point in making any kind of plan when it's never going to work and I'm not expecting to be alive long enough to even try?

"University makes me suicidalI obsess with studying to the point I have no personality, and I've been this way ever since my second to last year of school. I don't think I have any worth besides my grades. I used to enjoy studying quite a lot and education is the number one priority in my ""life"".             
Ever since I moved to another country I have fallen into moderate-level depression due to utter disappointment (with myself and this place). Many of my professors suck at their job of teaching and I have to waste 4x more time outside of class to understand concepts that I should have learned during class. This happens specially with calculus since I am not a math genius unfortunately, and although I can teach myself science, I cannot do so with maths. Therefore I am left with very little time to do anything other than studying and feel immense guilt when I am not being productive.                               
I am not sure what is the point of living when there's nothing I enjoy doing any more and nothing I do feels like it's worth it. ",1
"I don't know anymore(26/M)

A little about myself: * I was tested in the 98th percentile for intelligence prior to beginning elementary school. By the time I was in 4th grade, I was on psychopharmaceuticals to control what was alternately diagnosed as ADD, ADHD, ODD, PTSD and/or dysthymia.  
 * My typical daily dose was 65mg Ritalin, 200mg Paxil and .25mg Rispiridol. I removed myself from these medications cold turkey about 10 years ago.

In the past 18 years, I have gone through more tests of fortitude and character than any person should have to. I have a string of failed interpersonal relationships with women, the last of which got so completely out of hand that I walked out feeling that if I didn't, I would be going to the hospital or to jail. This woman that drove me past my boundaries, that fed off my sickness and fed me hers, told me a week after I left that she was pregnant. I learned ""my"" child's name from a social worker trying to collect support.

I've been unemployed for several months, living on a couch in a friend's one-bedroom apartment. I smoke cigarettes and weed daily, don't much care for drinking. Where does the money come from? There isn't much. Because of me, my roommate is getting evicted, and I don't have anywhere else to go.

I've thought about killing myself every day for the last 15+ years. I think of ways to die, how they would feel, the reactions of those who discover me dead in a certain way. I have lied to every therapist who has asked if I am a danger to myself or others by saying no. 

I have attempted suicide and been hospitalized 3 times. Each attempt is halted by the exact same thing: this would destroy some of my friends. I wish I didn't care, so I could spread the daily pain around and make everyone hurt like I hurt. But I do care, and that's why I am still upright and above ground.

It's been getting worse lately, and I am at a loss. I'm seeking mental health services (1 month wait), a family doctor (no given wait, probably months). I have no additional medical coverage to pay for meds or extended counselling. 

And I don't want to keep going. I am tired of getting hurt in every corner of my life, only to be watered and toweled and shoved back in for another round. 

I want to tap out.",1

"I want to end it.I do not want anyone or anything. That is the worse part. Suffering is one thing or not having is one thing, but when you just do not care anymore it's another thing. Sex or even threesomes are just so boring now.You know you get to a point where maybe you just want to put a period at the end of whatever this is. It seems to me life just isn't for everyone. Look the way I see it, life is like a movie. If I have sat through over half of it and it has sucked so far, chances are it's not going to get great at the very end and make it all worth it.

"I can't keep going on with the hate about meMy life these past two weeks have been a struggle to make it through. I have never felt so disgusted and sick towards myself. 

My friend group has about 5 people in it. I got into a fight with 3 out of the 5 people and they have since ghosted me and cut me out of their life. I haven't seen them in about 3 months and every text ends up in a huge brawl that I end up sobbing over. 

The two other people in the friend group are my best friends however, and I see that they feel uncomfortable associating themselves with me because the majority of the group hates me. 

The people who hate me are the ones that would usually host the hangouts and therefore I'm unable to see my two best friends anymore. I'm not so upset about the three other people who hate me but I can't stand seeing my best friend have a good time without me. 

I have had some terrible thoughts these past few days and there's no way to win the other three people back. Every weekend is painful to see them all have fun with no regard to me. 

I can't keep living as a thrown away object. ",1
"Really need someone to talk to...I've had social anxiety ever since I decided to go to a different school than all the people I grew up with during the transition from elementary school to high school. During the early years in my life up to grade 8 I wasn't socially anxious at all, in fact I was always the one to make people laugh and put on a show, didn't mind the spotlight. The only problem was these people I never really felt like I fit in with the people I grew up with. I'd get invited out occasionally but I never really fit it so I decided to start over by going to a different high school. 

This would be the worst decision of my life. During my two years there I was paralyzed with anxiety, made one friend and began to get depressed. While everyone was out enjoying life and hanging out with friends I was glued to the computer, getting lost in video games as an escape from reality. I would play every second I had and I feel that's what lead me to develop an anxiety disorder. Oddly enough I still had no problem going to and from class, or walking alone in public or anything of that nature. That was 10 years ago.

I'm 25 now and have been through a lot since then. After being diagnosed back in 2007 I was on various drugs, most of them didn't work except for one, cipralex. For one whole year, cipralex had effectively convinced me that my socially anxious days were over. I could finally be that person I'd always wanted to, I always knew that I had that person in me but the anxiety was preventing me from being that person. After a year of feeling on top of the world the medication started to lose it's effect and I slowly spiraled downward.

I was pretty bummed at this point. I started reading up on social anxiety on the internet, I wanted to know how it worked, once I knew that I could surely put an end to it over time. This is when I learned about cognitive behavioral therapy. I originally got a book by David D Burns to overcome my anxiety but quit half way through. I ended up living with the fact that I was anxious for a few years but back in December of 2011 I came across an audio series on overcoming social anxiety. 

The series required you to listed to a tape each week and read over the handouts for that session every day. And I was faithful, I'd read way past the recommended 30 minutes a day often. To be perfectly honest I now know more about SA than I have in my life, and I'm currently still on the program, a little over half way through and being faithful. I've put many of the strategies and methods learned into every day life and have had some success. I've been able to calm myself down at times and focus more externally by rationalizing my irrational thinking and taking them into a situation that would normally make me anxious.

At this point you're probably thinking that I posted this in the wrong section, and that it sounds like things are looking up. Well they are and they aren't. Getting over an anxiety disorder will cause relapses, so I could have my anxiety under control for a few days and then a few days after feel like a wreck. I'm supposed to be looking at relapses as a positive thing because you can't have a relapse if you haven't made progress. And I admit I have.

Here's the issue. Although I have this whole whack of knowledge now and have seen in work first hand, this requires a lot of work mentally. See before I knew any of this I'd just let the negative thinking flow freely, but now anytime that occurs there are steps and things I need to do to escape for the vicious circle of anxiety. On top of that, there are things I'm having trouble with now. Getting out of the house can be a nightmare at times, driving is nerve wracking at times.. Anytime I'm stopped next to someone at a red light I tense up and freeze because I feel they are looking at me. Even though I know that feelings can be false because they are created by thoughts and my thoughts are irrational. Getting a job is another obstacle I've yet to overcome. I graduated from college 4 months ago and have been unemployed since - and to be honest as of late I've been pretty much cooped up in my house - with the occasional outing on weekends to a bar or lounge. 

Every day when I wake up I know I have to prepare myself for another mental struggle with myself and it's tiring. My friends don't usually contact me unless I initiate first. And recently a friend who I've known since I was 4 has been really distant for some reason. Bottom line is is it worth it? I'm 25, no job, can't even go to the store without having a battle with my own mind... I just don't know what to do. My family knows I have Anxiety but not specially Social Anxiety. They don't understand that these simple things like going to the store or applying for a job are very challenging for me. They chalk it up to me being lazy and unmotivated when in actuality if I had rid myself of this I would have be the polar opposite. I want a future, I don't want to be a deadbeat.. But at the same time there's only so long I can continue to get rid of my SA before I become tired. I'm starting to learn toward the ""it's not worth it side"". Can anyone give me some advice? any advice? 

If you read my entire post I really appreciate it.

TLDR: Had a rough time in highschool no friends, eventually diagnosed with social anxiety many years later, tried medication that worked but eventually stopped. Been doing cognitive therapy for the past 4 months, seems to be working, but recently questioning whether or not it's even worth it anymore.",1

I want to feel real love i want to feel that someone cared for me even for a week. I have like 7 friends. But none of them are real friends. I miss those old days when i didint cared. I feel so sad when i see someone holding hands, kissing, hugging. Its just so depressing for me. Theres so little you can do to make someone day better. Just a hug, a short conversation or a smile would made my day 10000% better. I never felt a love. My parents only pretended but now i know they dont care. I'am just trying so hard to make someone really like me. I'am trying to talk to her trying to go out on a walk anything. But i always get a response something like: i have no time or just no, i'am so sad, i think every girl i asked to go out  (there wasnt much like 6 or less) on a walk or something nothing serious not a date just to meet and talk, refused. Same with my male friends always have a response no time. I just dont know what to do. I really want a hug righ now i feel so alone after today i seen that guy from my class hugging those girls at the goodbye. I tried reading this how to get a girl to like me thing. And i started reading and what i first saw was: 1. **Remember the last time you fell in love. I just didint**. So i closed it and started crying. I work so fucking hard. i'am training, trying to improve my ""inside"" i'am learning new things to have what to talk about but still so effort i put didint give me anything i wanted: even one day that i really feel like someone is loving me or caring about me. I wish i could have someone that will understand me or someone that i can hug just like that. I feel so lost so alone. So i have 1.5 year. To complete my goal, to even for a second feel someone that loves me. If i wont complete it i'am going to kill myself. Overwhelmed by my loneliness. if someone is in similar situation please message me. Sorry but i needed to let it out and english is not my main lang so sorry for mistakes.

I thought I had accommodation until mid December but the apartment I was in is being demolished and I was told last week that I had to leave on Monday. Thanks to the kindness of a stranger here I was able to afford a cheap room for three nights but last night was on the streets for the first time. I have one large suitcase with all my clothes and stuff in but no money to get a cheap room anymore while I try to get help from the council. I did not sleep last night through worry and I am writing this in the hope that someone can help because I have tried to kill myself before and am worried that I will try again if I find myself on the streets. I feel like there is hope because I'm told I will get an emergency benefit payment next week (probably Thursday) but until then, with no money, I will be on the streets. I have somewhere to stay, but it is over 50 miles away and I have no means of getting there. If I could get there I would be safe until the benefits payment comes in. So a train could either save my life by taking me to safety or kill me if I get so desperate that I throw myself beneath one. Is there anyone who can help me purchase a train ticket so I can  secure safe accommodation for the next week while the council sort my benefits and find me somewhere to live?

"[Important] TikTok is NOT for kids. TikTok is a shady and mostly unmoderated area place with porn.

So this is just plain bad. Kids in GRADE FUCKING THREE are using TikTok and have (probably) seen porn before because of TikTok.

Types of porn on TikTok include people showing off their bare butt, full body cam of naked people, and girls showing boobs.

So TikTok is a place if you're willing to see porn. Otherwise go elsewhere safer because you're not supposed to go on TikTok at school.

However, our school district not only blocks the website but also the API so TikTok is blocked, even on the mobile app.

While TikTok might be an ""excitement"" during the COVID pandemic, TikTok is NOT a safe place. Make sure to read the reviews of the app, website, or product before downloading/accessing it.",0

"Suicide/depression/anxiety help, new to this first time.Hi everyone, im new to reddit and wouldnt mind some peoples opinions. Ive never done this before so dont know how it will come out or how it will come across but its something i feel i need to do. 

Ive suffered with social anxiety all my life, ive always just thought i was shy, nervous etc and have only thought about it the past few years (im 23 btw). Im currently at university in my second year and im struggling super bad with my anxiety. I struggle on my course, i struggle with friends, i barely ever go in with my panic attacks 24/7 or just the feelings i get from my peers on my course or the work etc etc. Im just tyring to summarise a bit and im probably writing for the sake of writing so im sorry. 

I havent been into uni for months, im still trying to do the work by myself, i lie to my mum and brother about how its going as i dontwant to let them down and fail them again. (Ive already failed one year at another uni because of my anxiety and depression. They dont know i have anxiety or depression, i plucked up the courage to go to my doctors about it 8 years odd later and was diagnosed with it. I rejected the medication as again i got too worried and scared. I lied to my GP when i saw her about suicidal thoughts and drugs, was that the right thing to do? i DONT want people to treat me differently or have to go to any hosiptal etc. Should i go back and tell them im suicidal? the thoughts are increasing, ive googled the best ways i think to do it etc ive thought of lots of thing around it, such as how ive let my parents down if i fail uni again etc. 

Also i dont know if i shoud talk to a friend about this. Ive only ever talked to a mental health practitioner about how i feel, but again not fully about suicidal thoughts etc. Ive got one friend who im super close with, ive known her for 3 years, shes had depression like me and i got her through hers but never told her about mine. I never really understood that i had it when she told me about hers. i basically want to tell her about everything, she already knows everything about me but this, she knows about my anxiety and meetings with people about it. But should i tell her about my suicidal thoughts? i really dont want to affect the relationship i have with her by telling her. (currently crying writing this). Will it affect my friendship with her if i tell her? will she treat me differently? will i regret it? 

Also ive started drinking more and taking more drugs like MDMA and cannabis to try stop my worries. What do people think of this? I love the high of MDMA, it just chills me out and gives me such happiness which im struggling to get more and more each day. Im just tyring to forget about this shit world and bubble of worry im in 24/7. I cant even order food at a restaurant etc i get so worried and panicky. Should i try go back to my GP and tell them that ive been taking a fair amount of drugs to stop me feeling like this? (currently on MDMA writing this). Should i tell them about my suicidal thoughts? because i lied the first time, im scared of what will happen, and find it so hard to talk about and say.

Going back to uni, ive not been into one of my modules all year and ive not been put onto the exam timetable. This is freaking me out massively, ive amiled my tutor to say ive been missed off but now im thinking what if they dont let me on it because ive not been there all year or attended anything to do with it. What if this makes me fail uni? I cant do another year out working letting my mum down, id rather end my life, the shame of it all again. ive been thinking of what i could do for a job, always wanted to be a Royal marine ever since i was a kid, but would they let me in? especially with my mental health condition. Ive also thought it would a good job to have as im not afraid to die, ive thought about it so much that im not sure i would mind, it would be an easy way i guess. 

Sorry if this doesnt make sense or has come across as just muddled up rubbish. Im just writing off the cuff and just need answers and help. Im stuck in my own head, i cant escape and dont know what to do. Just going to go get pissed now to forget this. ",1

"My life has turned to absolute shit2 months ago my ex girlfriend broke up with me and I moved back in with my parents. I was living downtown going to school. My life was great and I was so happy. My online business was going great bringing in money while I was in class. Now it's doing like absolute shit and my competitor is beating me pretty badly.

Me and my ex were absolutely in love with each other. I had been with her for a year and I was positive this was the girl I would spend the rest of my life with. She broke up with me because she saw I was becoming a bum among other things that I could have done better. Basically I would still have her right now if I wasn't such a fuckup. I keep trying to tell myself that it was a ""learning experience"" and that the next one will be better.

My situation isn't getting any better. I still feel like shit every single day and I don't know how much longer I can take it. Add to this that a few of my friends have broken up with their girlfriends but they are back together. It just makes me wonder why that can't happen to me as well.

My life is just full of regret and I don't see any way out of it without putting in a bunch of effort. And even then it's not a sure thing. I don't want to have put in all this effort only to fail and be back where I am now.

I texted my ex a month after she broke up with me and she wanted nothing to do with me. All of her friends think I'm a monster and her parents hate me. I have been going over the idea of showing up to her house with roses. If it goes bad I am going to go downtown, go up to the roof of my old apartment building and jump. It's not the ideal way to die. I'd much rather go instantly but I have no access to guns or anything. I figure if I don't change my mind on my drive there I won't change my mind on the way down. The other option is the exit bag but that can apparently make you severely brain damaged if you don't do it properly or if somebody finds you before you die. So I've been thinking about sticking to a more sure way.

At this point the only things standing in the way are the fear of jumping and how my parents will feel. They'll feel like they could have done something, or that they're failures as parents. No matter what I write in my note I know the pain from me dying will stay with them forever. But sometimes I come to realize that absolutely nothing will matter after I'm gone and it makes me want to go through with it.",1

"Does it ever get better?Almost five years now.

I'm so fucking sick of people telling me that it'll get better or that I'm good enough. All my life I haven't been good enough.

All I do is work on myself. Appearance, mindset, etc: I've tried it all. Subliminals, hypnosis, nutrition, lifting, looksmaxing, 'confidence', whatever. I'm an ACE certified Nutrition Coach and Personal Trainer for fucks sake, I have nearly a 315 bench at 195 6'1, and I spend most of my money right now on products to maintain or improve my appearance. But I'm still not good enough for women. Before anyone says anything about 'personality', it has literally nothing to do with that anecdotally and according to hundreds of university studies. Your face = your personality.

So what's the issue? Well it appears to be my face. I'm 6'1 blue eyed muscular and lean and very well groomed but it doesn't matter, nothing changes, I can't beat these god awful genes.

I've been diagnosed with BDD and depression but I mean it's all bullshit. BDD is simply opening my eyes to the source of my plight and this is what makes me depressed: I just want to be good enough and to be loved.

It's not like I've been without relationships, I've had a few, but they're negligible for reasons I don't need to go on about. They all end with me feeling more like shit than before; the last one was 13 months ago.

I've wanted to kill myself for a while now but I don't have a gun and would not want to hurt my family. 

I just want to be happy with myself and to not be alone.

People feed me platitudes and tell me I'm a good looking dude who's very much so good enough, hell gay dudes and my buddies think I'm some Chad. Clearly it's not the case.

I don't know what to do anymore. I'm 22 and will finish college soon, my life seems to be just never ending loneliness and depression. I'm watching my youth go by and there's nothing I can do despite trying my best. I don't want to be alone. I've been in a bad place for a while now; I truly believe that I'm not meant to be happy.

People have reached out but I'm too scared of them and their intentions to respond, withdrawing is my form of control, I dont even know if its hopelessness but every day seems to be driving towards suicide until it is inevitable, while people with less potential leave me in the dust with raw effort, i dont know what its like to feel like a real person with real needs that have to be expressed",1

"Does anyone else feel like they were neglected by their parents just because you were never a problem child? I know this isn't really a thing to complain about, but i've always wondered if anyone else felt the same

I wa thirdborn in my family and homeschooled for the first 10 years. My mother had to school my rwo older brothers before I came into the world and this whittled down my mothers patience. By the time I was needing to be schooled, my mother was already busy enough with my other brothers that she didn't have the capacity to give me very much attention. 

By the time I was able to read well on my own, my mother would just plop a textbook down in front of me and I would go ahead and study on my own. I learned rather quickly that my mother had little patience when I asked for help twice in a row, or took too long to figure out easy stuff. Yelling and occasionally beatings would follow so I stopped asking for help altogether. 

From that point on, almost everything I did was on my own. I would start to fear help itself so I would kick my rear into overdrive and focus the hell out of my times tables or whatever it was that I was studying just to avoid help altogether. 

It wasn't just with studying. I was for some strange reason really sensetive to yelling and I would prefer a beating rather than a scold on pretty much every occasion. Because of this, I learned cery quickly how to be a good boy in the house, not making any trouble whatsoever. Never causing problems and never having any that I had to ask assistance with.

I had fun by myself in those times. Jigsaw puzzles and puzzle books and jacks and whatever other 1 player games I could find, I played them. Keeping all the possible problems I could cause to a minimum.

A decade down the line, i'm now older and in high school. I do exceedingly well in every class and never cause a problem for anybody. I do find myself without a social life which I considered to be a waste of energy at the time. I've also noticed that all my exceptional achievements are going pretty much unseen by my parents. I believe that they just got used to how I was never a problen and now its standard in their eyes. I grew up always being great and pushing into greatness even further is exceedingly difficult.

Now i'm 19 and I feel in sort of trapped in this image I created for my parents that I ""must always be perfect"" and ""never cause a problem"". I've worked so hard to keep this image but I feel like its tearing me down.

I feel really down all the time now. I just feel so unmotivated and unhappy. The ""good boy"" in me says to ignore all that emotional bs and just keep moving along, but its harder and harder to do that every passing day. I just feel depressed. I hide it all from my parents because this would be an issue that I would be putting onto them. ""Sorry mom, but your 3rd child has a problem"". Also, I don't even know if theyll care.

And looking back on this whole situation, I feel like I have only myself to blame. I feel like I was the one who caused my parents to not care about me because I never wanted them to care about me and I avoided it whereever I could.

I'm the one who caused them to look at me the way they do.

I’ve been to therapists and psychiatrists and group therapies but I still feel like I’m worthless.  I struggle with finding the will to stay.  I don’t want to die rn, but I’m just watching the days go by, of me feeling empty and worthless.  I try to help others with their thoughts but my advice falls flat now because my own thoughts have taken a permanent toll on me.  Most of my attempts happened because I was scared of my abusive ex and nobody would take my concerns about him seriously.  I felt alone in my pain so I just did it.  I haven’t had contact with him in months but I’m afraid if he reaches out to me or somehow talks to me again, that I’ll relapse.",1

"Tomorrow after work, im going to finally do itIm fed up and tired of this now. The pain is too much for me, im tired of everything. Tired of the few people who say they are my friends but arent there when I actually need them. Im tired of feeling isolated, treated by society like a piece of shit. Bullied and not having many friends and not having any SO. Isolation is one of the worse things which is why we give criminals it, even if you hang around with bad people you dont feel as bad as being isolated. Im tired of not owning a family since half of them dont care for me and the ones who did are no longer here. Ive gone to commit before as you can probably see in one of my earlier posts but didnt because i was too considerate for others but im done now. why should i be considerate when no one irl is considerate for me. You guys are great on here, but there is only so much you can do.  I guess it just wasnt meant to be. I will reply when i can, as im at work in a few hours and then ill probably sleep before making my last journey on this earth. I want to wish you guys better futures because nothing is worse then feeling like this. ",1

"My Mother is suicidal and has a plan, not sure what to do. My whole life I have been helping my mother battle her depression and PTSD. I have given everything to help keep her going and alive. She has been in and out of Mental hospitals for the last 15 years and has overcome so much.

Recently I moved out of state for work and I haven't been able to help her like I used to. I still pay some of her bills, but I can't afford to pay for everything. She doesn't have a job and is considered ""seriously mentally ill"" by the state of Arizona. With cuts to the budget she has lost almost all of her state funded assistance in the last year. She is so incredibly depressed she doesn't have the motivation to even look for alternatives. I found out her mother has been sending her money over the last year. Her mother, my grandma, cannot keep sending her money and let her know this last week. My mom does not work, and has been unsuccessful in her attempts at social security and disability. She now has zero income and is about to be evicted and lose what little she has.

She has just informed me that she is going to kill her self next week. She has attempted suicide numerous times through-out my life, but I have always been around to take care of her and the situation. This time I am out of reach and am helpless on what to do. If anyone has any suggestions or is familiar with programs or organizations in Arizona that may help it would be most appreciated. I'm afraid anything I could do at this point may not be enough. ",1

"depression, HELP!!I have been battling depression for along time. I have lost all interest in things, i am not active. i dont care to be. i used to be a team player, a everyones friend type of guy, my family and friends love me. But for more than a year now i have been battling depression, i have used booze, weed, pills, i never became an addict, but i still tried to numb the pain. I lost my fight and cannot muster strength to go on. Suicide has been a seed growing in my mind for as long as i can remember. 

 My gf of more than half a decade tell sme howunhappy she was while we wre together, when all that time she was saying how happy she was. She got a new job and wants to leave me in the fucking dust. I did everything possible to make her happy, buti wasnt enopugh, i gave her EVERYTHING that i could in mind, body, and spirit. Now shes a cruel beast. long ago when i tried to leave her she wouldnt let me, not shes telling me to leave her. Except now, i dont know how to, I have been drinking heavily for a year now, hiding it from my family and friends and co workers. I am at my end. I cannot go on anymore. I found a new girl, but i am so emotionally fucked up i cannot seem to let her in and that kills me. My ex fucked me up so much that i lost my will to live. I am considering killing myself i want to end the pain. I do not have the will to go on. It has been a good 27 years, but that looks like the end of the road. i AM SO SORRY TO my family and friends, I want yall to live long and happy lives. I love each of yall. I only came on here because i didnt know where else to go. I am ashamed of this, i am embarassed of this, and i hate myself for this.

"Everything keeps piling onIn the past two months I've lost a 2 year old cat, my 15 year old dog, and a few hours ago got rejected for my last sort of hope for a job.

I can't get a ""real"" job because of my slew of mental instabilities. I barely leave the house anymore. Help for those instabilities isn't in the cards because of other instabilities that make me want to stay the way I am. So I applied for a job that allows me to be creative and make money without interacting with -anyone-. It only took two days for them to reject me. I can reapply with a different email but what's the point? Nothing is gonna change. Just another failure in the long line of failures that is my life.

It was a job that, as far I knew, most people get accepted to. A way to passively make income. That's not really a thing. There's nothing else I can do with that level of isolation from the public. I don't want to interact with others, I don't want to deal with people. I can't. Even thinking about it makes me start to shake. So now I'm out of options and I just don't know what to do. I guess just continue being a leech to my family until my parents die and shuffle off with them

I don't even know why I'm writing this. I'm not gonna kill myself. I'm wasting your time. I can't leave my family with that pain though I really wish I could. I want to rest so badly and not have to hate myself and everything I am so fervently. I don't know what comes after we die but even the unknown is preferable to this shit. ",1

"I want to finally share my story before i go, i want to use my voice before its gone.Hey there,  
My name is anonymous, i am 22 years of age and i am ending my life.  
Wow, yeah, i know attention seeking right?   
Wrong.  
I have never shared my story, and i want to now while im still here,, while i have time, maybe somebody needs to hear this so they decide to get help while they are able, as i am relieved to say i will no longer be treading through the dark, treacherous forests.  
I will add a TW, for substance abuse, sexual and physical abuse, and countless acts of self destruction.   
I have never fallen from grace, i have always exploded. I will also add that i am having difficulty spelling so please forgive me. I just dont want to be the only one who knows anymore.

I dont want to bore you, so i wont share every tiny thing but i would like to share experaicnes i had that ultimelty led me to this decision. PLEASE get help before it gets this bad. please...  


I had an interesting childhood, punishments that didn't make sense to me ( grabbing my ankles and being hit as hard  they could hit me until i fell over, which if i fell over, the timer they had set would restart, mind you i never knew how many minutes of being hit i had) or not allowing me to shower without being looked at or withholding food or forcing me to exercise, threatening to beat me to a bloody pulp, sending me to my uncles where he would repeatdly rape me, just stuff like that. By the time i was in 8th grade i was engaged to my abuser, which my mother would send me to stay with him often and i would end up getting raped and beaten from my abuser adn his father. i have had 2 traumatic brain injuries in the past 4 months from him. fun fact.   


I have always tried pleasing everybody, my dad was an alcoholic and i have nevr seen him sober, my mom was just abusive as fuck and broke my heart before anybody else was able too, i had an aunt whom i loved with my whole heart, she meant the entire world to me, she made me laugh and she made me feel loved, she really cared about me despite how horrible of a person i felt i was, even as a weee child. She was my world, truly. Her smile made me feel joy, her voice was the most calming melody i have ever heard. She was a true gemtstone. I cant wait to see her. She committed suicide when i was 11, i have never been the same. All i can thinka bout is how crueld and painful this world is, how much it takes out of me to keep breathing. All i can think about is how beautiful it would be to be with her again. To see her face and be wrapped in her arms. To hear her again. She was my mom, nd i cant tell you a time where i needed a mom, more then now.  


I had my first suicide attempt when i was in 7th grade, I slashed my wrists and took the ativan my doctor gave me for my PTSD, i grabbed a few bottles of alcohol from teh fridge,w ent to my room, and dissappeared. Thats was the first time i realized why my dad couldnt love me, why my mom never cared about me, why my aunt ddecided to leave. I understood. I ended up going inpatient, with the child proective services involved because i have severe bite wounds on my thighs, froim my abuser, and my mom sending me to his house. They failed me, as i was sent back to live with my parents despite it all. things got so much worse. so much fucking worse. I went from taking 10mg of ativan to whole bottles of aleve, to shooting heroin and drinking myself into black outs every night, buying benzos or opiates, finding ways to escape, overdosing every other weekend because life is fucking msierable. i am MISERABLE. i have nothing left these days. My abuser is still in my life,  im on my 2nd trumatic brain injury this year, im an addict, im an alcoholic, i have CPTSD that leads me into having trauma responses so often i cant leave my house, i have no friends, i have no family, i have abosloutly nothing. im falling the fuck apart. i havce been since i can remember/. Its coming up to the year mark on me losing my baby, as i had a miscarriage from ym abuser and that was the only thing i had ever dreamed of, was being a mom and hoping to love a child the way i wasnt loved. I feel completely broken. i have nothing here for me, i have no purpose, i have no reason to stay here when i am in so much pain, i could be at home with my aunt where i feel safe and secure again.  


Basically, its too late for me, i have been severely mentally ill since i was a pre-teen, and i did not get help, i ended up killing myself. i ended up not having a family and haveing no chancwes of things ever getting better. my choice was to be free from this pain, because it is too much for me to carry. i cannot physically hold it anymore. please dont get to this place, reache out to a lvoed one, a friend, the crisis center, scream at the top\[ of your lungs for help, if you are a adolescent, PLEASE GET HELP NOW, please just fucking get help right now before you are overdosing on a shit load of meds that arent even prescribed to you. dont maek your mother lose her child, your friends will miss you and the whole in their heart will be filled with vodka, dont let it get this fucking bad, dont let it get so fuckign bad that your suicide note has to be on fucking reddit because you have nobody else.

"14 days to liveI got scammed by a 'landlord' like a fucking idiot, 2 weeks from when my current lease ends I have nowhere to go. 

I am what corporations have graciously decided to call an 'essential worker' but I know nobody would care at all if I died tomorrow. I make $600 a month, part-time minimum wage, so my only choice in housing is subleasing, where nobody asks about your income.

I made a promise to myself months ago that if I became homeless, I'd kill myself. And now that's only 14 days away.

I want to live but it's fucking hard. I don't know that it's worth it. Why keep living just to be in constant pain? It's stupid.

I have 2 methods: a bridge over a river on my way to work, and the train tracks behind my apartment. Being homeless means the apartment balcony isn't a viable method anymore but I could always end it early, in which case I have my third and preferred method: a dive into the sunset from 12 stories up.

I wish I could die instantly. Right now. I'm fucking sick of life. Of pain. Of hope. This has to stop. This has to stop.",1
"feeling bad for my boyfriendI feel bad for him.
I'm seventeen and he's eighteen, we've been together for three years now and he's always been there for me throughout my depression and family issues. He loves me with all his heart and so do I, he's more than I could have ever asked for. I've tried to kill myself a few times, he's always come by in the morning and checked on me, he even let me move in with him to help avoid me getting drowned in my depression.
Sometimes it just all gets too overwhelming, my feelings and everything. I love him so much but I feel like things would be better if I was just gone. I know that would be a lie or so they say. They say life is just starting but I don't know if I can't stand it any longer. In the end everything doesn't matter anyways, we all die. I've tried ignoring my feelings for both of us, to feel better but the more I wait it just seems to build up. I miss having a consoler but I don't see the point anyways.

"I Can't Handle The PainI don't know how to get over being so lonely. I have a girlfriend that I love dearly that I've been with for three years today, but we were looking for a guy to add and it blew up in my face. I got close to him and he got detached and absent after nurturing my abandonment issues, which made me suicidal to begin with. Eventually, I'd have panic attacks waiting for the one text a day he'd send me to tide me over, and it was awful. I really cared for him, a lot. It fucking sucks. I broke it off with him last Friday in a diplomatic way, hoping we'd be friends, and he told me I was selfish and dragging my girlfriend into this, and that I wasn't a while person. He hurt me really bad, but I miss him so much, and there's nothing I can do. It's my anniversary and my girlfriend is being so understanding and such a sweetheart, but I feel like never getting out of bed again. I want to escape this pain so badly, but there's no way out. It feels like every year I become less and less of a person and more of an awful monster that everyone will leave. I don't have any friends anymore. The only one that stuck around ignores me and ditches plans so often that I haven't seen her in almost three whole months, and we've only texted a couple of times between then. I stopped drinking and she stopped thinking I was fun. I'm a shell of the person I was before, and I don't know when it got this bad.",1

I am a shy and somewhat socially awkward woman so I do not have much of a social life. I have never dated anyone (which I recognize is pathetic). I have one friend but she belittles me a lot and makes me feel like a loser. She has tried to set me up on dates a few times but gets mad when I do not like her friends (they are extroverted type men who like to go out to parties a lot and/or flaunt how much money they have. My ideal person would be someone shy like me who likes more low key things). This friend is always making it seem like I am too old now to find anyone like that and that I should settle for whoever offers to date me first (she married at like 21 btw and always makes me feel like shit for not doing the same). Lately, I have started to believe her, maybe my time to find love has passed and it’s all over. I’m not a “cool” person, I enjoy silly things like films (as a hobby I have dabbled in video essays on films/tv on youtube), video games, and writing screenplays, these are probably time wasting hobbies that aren’t efficient and I realize I’m probably too old to enjoy them.

"Dont want him to think it was his fault.hi, I am really desperate to die tonight. Things have just gotten too bad and I live in fear. I am tired of it no matter what I do I will always be under this awful blanket of terror. My mother is an abuser, and I've come to terms with it. she told me today she feels absolutely no empathy, no remorse, nothing for ANYTHING. she said it while she was laughing and then told me to go fuck off . She just constantly spits in my face and invades my space and treats me like I am subhuman, she will never let me go and i am too stupidly dependent on her to ever hope of life outside. i don't even have my fucking drivers license and i am 19. the horrible terror she makes me feel on top of all the depression is just too much, even at college she threatens to ""show up and make a scene"" because she wants me gone but not for *too* long. she always says people to who commit suicide go to hell. i dont fucking care anymore i just want this nightmare of a life to end. if i go to hell so be it, as long as shes not there. 
to the point, a guy i was seeing since like december is abroad this term. i love him a lot, idk if he loves me back, or just thinks of us as Fwb or something honestly I dont care because I would do anything for him and I love him so much, he is really the only reason i made it this far, he gave me a lot of reason to believe in life. He is so level headed and he might not love me but i am hopelessly devoted to him. i already wrote him a note saying none of this was his fault but i am terrified he will think he played some part in it for some really dumb reason like he was teasing me today about some mundane thing but i love him so much and he had nothing to do with why i would commit suicide. i dont know whether to write it all out about the abuse so someone KNOWS why it happened or if that would just make me seem like a stupid brat like i am. i dont know. i just want him to know it wasnt his fault but i dont want to go outright and say it to him while i am alive because then he might realize i am planning on dying and that would just make everything so much worse.

"My father seems to be giving up.I received a phone call today from my uncle (aunt's second husband who happens to be a doctor) about my diabetic father.  He was reaching out to me because, as he put it, he couldn't stand by and not reach out to me and my siblings while my dad allowed his health to deteriorate to the point that he could hurt himself of die.

According to to my uncle, my 58 year old father has consciously not been taking his insulin, he's dropped a bunch of weight, and is most likely suffering from some kind of clinical depression.  My uncle has also told me that my father has been lying about taking his insulin and that when finally caught in the lie, expressed that his reason for not taking his medication is that he no longer wants to live.

The depression thing isn't really something out of the blue, my dad checked himself into a psychiatric hospital shortly after leaving (some would say abandoning) my mother and me and my brother and sister.  I didn't actually find out about this psychiatric episode until years later.  My sister and I happened to be in college at the time, but my brother was 15 and still finishing high school.  Our house ended up getting foreclosed on and things were pretty tough for a while there.  I'm pretty sure he's been on some regiment of anti-depressants, zoloft, prozac, etc. since.

My mother thinks that my father may suffer from undiagnosed bi-polar disorder and talks about how he would have these manic phases followed by, as she put it, ""hitting rock bottom"".

A little context would help here, I think.  My dad founded and owned a very successful home building company in the 80's.  At one point, he was a millionaire, had a company jet, nice cars, etc.  My mom refers that that as the ""Gatsby days"".  Apparently there was some kind of scandal between him and a young intern at the company and he was forced out of the company that he founded with his brother.  Things seemed ok for a while, from the perspective of an 10 year old anyway.

As I got older, I noticed that we stopped going on vacation, my mom had to get a job substitute teaching so that we had healthcare for my younger brother who had asthma since my dad was technically self-employed (he was a real estate developer), things stopped getting fixed around the house, etc. and then my dad had an episode with his health where he went into a diabetic coma and from that point forward, he was a diabetic, making getting health insurance even more difficult.

Flash forward to my sophomore year in college and my father is having to go out of state to find work as a building contractor and one day just isn't answering calls and we find out that my mom and brother have to be out of the house we grew up in because it is being foreclosed.

Eventually my dad divorced my mom, which is really strange since she probably had more of a reason to divorce than he did and she still wanted to work things out.

To say that the relationship between my father and his kids was strained would be an understatement. From the age of 20 until about 28, I probably spoke to my father less than 10 times.  We were all still reeling from our family, as we knew it, being torn apart when he left, although my younger sister and brother seemed to reach out to him earlier than I did.

They say time heals all wounds and eventually we all began having a somewhat ""normal"" relationship with our dad, to the point that we keep up with each other on a pretty consistent basis, which can be difficult since everyone in my immediate family live in different cities (although in the same region).  He happens to be a pretty fun, funny, intelligent guy to hang out with, now that we're all adults.

So the most current status is that he has been living in my aunt and uncle's second house, rent free, for the past 2 years, I believe he was living with his mother before that, and had remarried and then divorced before that.  He has been having a hard time finding work.  He works as a contractor and the economy hasn't been so hot in the housing sector, in case you hadn't heard.  I've also come to discover that he's having legal trouble, the nature of which I hope to discover when I go visit him this weekend with my brother.  He's supposed to be going to the doctor tomorrow to get a check up and get back on insulin, as well as get his head scanned.  Part of the new found focus seems to be from that fact that my sister is pregnant again after miscarrying her first pregnancy, although I hope this is more than just trying to prevent himself from dying before her first child is born so as not to stress out my sister and put the pregnancy in jeopardy.  I hope he has a genuine intrest in seeing his first grandchild born and grow up.

I feel like my dad's life has seen a lot of great success, only to be punctuated by great loss.  He lost a fortune, for a time, his family, and now he can't find consistent work, is most likely being sued, and is bumming a place to stay off his brother-in-law.  He's always had a veneer of contentment and happiness, although lately it seems like most of the conversations I've been having with him are rote and pretty superficial.  He doesn't really want to share anything real about how he's doing, just that he hasn't been ""handling things very well"" and that he doesn't want to burden us.  He's also always been a proud, if not completely honest, man.

I and my siblings do love him very much and I don't want to see him give up and maim himself or die because life is hard.  This whole thing seems really passive aggressive.  He doesn't seem happy and when I pressed him about trying to turn things around with his health and with his life, there was an aire of uncertainty about the whole thing that was very disconcerting.

I know that we have to be supportive and let him know that the people in his life love and care what happens to him.  I don't think he's a lost cause.

Anyway, sorry for the wall of text.  I needed to get that off my chest.

Thanks.",1

I set my birthday to public on FB to see what would happen. Nothing that's what happened. I wanted just one happy birthday that wasn't from my mom or brother. Apparently that's a lot to ask for.

By and large I'm doing better this year than last year. I no longer go straight to suicide when considering my options for any problems. So I guess that's progress, but I'm still unsure if this will be my last birthday.",1
"I am already dead, might aswell kill myself.Two years ago I tried a drug other than alcohol and nicotine for the first time in my life. During the buzz I panicked, my heart was racing and my body felt heavy and strange.

I immediately got the feeling that I fucked up and that I was damaged for life. About 24 hours after the incident I tried to sleep. Yet again I panicked because I still did not feel normal. I started to feel muscles twitching and hear sounds in my head.

A couple of days later when I felt better I noticed that my dick felt dull and that I could'nt orgasm.

To this day I still have these problems. My sex life is dead because my orgasms are weak as fuck and my body has zero urge to ejaculate. I do not longer feel any attraction to women. I hear screaming sounds in my head/ears every time I try to sleep. My muscles twitch like crazy when I am anxious.

I am seeing a doctor about my problems at the moment and I am subscribed some antidepressants. I still feel that I have fucked up so bad that I will never be able to forgive myself and will forever live a compromised life.

The anxiety and constant thoughts about this takes over my life completely. I do not wish to sit in my sofa in 20 years, crying about that I fucked up when I was only a teenager. Might aswell skip out of the window sooner than that.

"It's been a while.Almost forgot I had this account. Can any of you relate to the feeling of taking steps backward? I feel like I put a ton of effort into making progress with my depression and bad habits, but then after one fuck up, I'm right back in this spot, wanting everything to end again. I have a hard time not blaming myself for these things when I really know better than to cause them. People around me feel obligated to help and/or feel responsible for my panicked decision to down pills but no matter what had happened I'm the one who took them. I really scared some of my friends this time, and the one I love. I think she felt the worst about it. Whatever it was I took made it almost impossible to tell what was real and what wasn't. Felt like I was dreaming, and I treated it like a dream at times so I was talking nonsense. I kept losing my train of thought before finishing my sentences, I kept forgetting where I was and what I was doing. She just watched with tears in her eyes. (It only occurred to me just now that I'm not even completely sure she was there. Could've imagined it.) It took a really long time but everything's worn off now. My best friend seems to just not wanna talk about it, maybe if we talk it'll feel too real to him. I think he just doesn't want to hurt. He told me I said bye to the girl but I don't remember it. I'm gonna cut it short here because I feel like I'm just gonna ramble. Thank you for reading and/or contributing to this sub at all. This sub has opened my eyes in many ways and helped tremendously.",1

"Not seeing a point in crawling forward anymore, once again thinking about suicide tonight, but in a calm way. Hopefully i wont be a coward this time and actually make up my mind.Im not even really sure why i am writing this post, i just feel alone and i am alone. I have no one to talk to nor to do anything. I feel emotionally numb, i cant cry, i barely feel any emotions. Death and suicide doesnt bother me and im fine with it being here and i want it. Im complete 0 in real life and dont tell me otherwise, i experienced nothing in real life other than walking from home to school and the other way around. Ive spent most of my life online, and so i tried finding first friends, then love online. Friends are not exactly something im looking for, and i am able to somewhat feel love. For me, one person that i would be with means more and does more than if i had 500 friends.

I tried several times to find love, i was with some people, but in the end they always dumped me/put me away. Some cases were horrible and i barely picked myself up, and some were somewhat friendly but they still hurt and made me go back to being hopeless and giving up.

Some hours ago, one person i was with told me that they want to be just friends, and that they dont feel ""that thing"" anymore. Just like it always was- the feelings fade away, the messaging stops, being lovey stops, everything falls- all while i am trying to hold it up and make it feel like the first time we met, but its not working if only one side is doing it.

Im a wreck, i probably have few mental issues, but i dont know if thats true because i wasnt checked and i dont want to be checked, atleast in my place where i live. I struggle with a lot of things and i feel useless and worthless. I barely have energy to do daily basis things that many other normal people do. Im very negative and i overthink a lot, but im trying to be positive for the one i am with. Though i am friendly, good person and im very open.

I panic and overthink and whatever else whenever the other person goes off, or doesnt reply me, or isnt as lovey and so on- Im paying attention to the smallest details and whenever i feel like something is going down slowly, i go down with it. In the end its all falling apart just like i felt it in the beginning.

Im done with people, i tried my best on finding someone perfect, i thought i found them, and i lost them. Im done with people, they are horrible. Most of them just use you as a ladder to climb up but leave you behind. You give something to someone, and you get nothing or a punch back.

I wont be able to find anyone that is like me, and has the same mindset and thoughts about relationship and things associated with it etc.

I should just give up completely- if i didnt already, make up my mind and actually do it tonight.",1

"I feel like a massive faliureI recently have been very 'depressed', or at least that's what I think it is. I have huge break downs, mainly when I'm alone and I just don't know what to do. I failed my maths and english twice in a row, my driving theory test 5 times, my course exams, and now, as edgy as it sounds, I feel like the part of me I once had, is dying.

I no friends as I used to confine myself to a small friendship circle. The friends I had ditched me because their girlfriends didn't like me, so they pushed me away. I sit alone in my room at home because when I confronted my parents they called me an idiot and said ""You're just sad, get over it"".

The reason I am here though is because, recently, I have been thinking about suicide a lot, and have hidden pills in my drawer that at the moment I can't bring myself to take, but I can't bring myself to get rid of them either.

I am 18 years of age, have tried meditation, walks, exercise and suicide phone lines. I just want some advice.",1
"donâ€™t get too connected to ur internet friends fr it never turns out good for me (ik lots of people have great friendships that they made over discord)

example: me and this girl we used to talk so much and we had some things in common like both trying to stop self harming other things so we talked A LOT but as i should have expected it ends terrible for me but she just moves on to someone else

pretty much everyone i considered a great friend said that they got tired of me which hurts and i canâ€™t figure out what i did wrong, i guess i wasnâ€™t online enough.  one guy from switzerland (iâ€™m from england) met on discord and we woke on snap , friends enough for me to be doing his english homework for him. but again one day he starts getting toxic and now heâ€™s blocked me

"I can't hold my feelings in forever.I want out of this life, but I know I can't go. I'm needed.

I'm just miserable for so many reasons. I'm not a naturally happy person, and I suffer from depression. I have no true joy in my life. I always feel alone. I tried being in two relationships but I was both times abandoned and left with feelings of hurt. I think I suffer from social anxiety. Lastly, I have no faith to guide me through my internal sadness.

I am probably just a liability at this point. I always thought I could find joy or purpose to continue if I was in a relationship with someone, but that's all wrong. It's not healthy. You need to already be stable and emotionally balanced before you engage in a relationship. I don't know if I can ever be like that now.

All I ever wanted was to spend my life with someone who I could care for, and maybe they would care for me right back. But I cannot and should not count on it. If I want to find inner peace I guess I have to look elsewhere. I don't even have the energy or willpower to do that though. I wish I could give up without hurting the people who need me. Until my misery outweighs my duty to them, I guess I'll just have to keep suffering.

"Pharmacist and Psych almost killed me - cautionary story.I finally submitted to the litany of people telling me to go on medication, so I was put on a combo of Resperidone and Wellbutrin to prevent my suicide that I desperately did NOT want to do. I would take these pills as directed (if you try them, then do it right), but 3 weeks in when I was having them filled out at the pharmacy, they ran out of my Wellbutrin due to a regional shortage!

The pharma called my Psychiatrist to see if I could take the x2 quick release ones instead, and they mutually agreed it would suffice until mine were available. They told me to take a double dose for the day I missed, but I double dosed a pill that is already double the strength....

That evening I was trying to eat ramen with my gf, and my soul shattered into a million pieces and I thought I instantly needed to kill myself - like right fucking now. The pain felt like a combo of my parents dying, being sentenced to prison, and being diagnosed with HIV and paralysis, all at once. I fell into a fetal position crying with snot and spit all over my face, in a restaurant. 

If my gf didn't drive me, I would have driven my car into a building at 150km/h to die, or slit my wrists in the tub. I thought of suicide-by-cop as well.... Anything. 

The hospital was disgusted by the incompetence of the pharma and psych, and their now under investigation. My arms are sliced open from cutting, and a year and half later, I'm getting my scars covered with tattoos tomorrow.

TLDR, take pills if you have run out of options - they've saved millions of lives. But 
only if you trust your doctors and always stand up for yourself if you're skeptical. A wrong combo can be fatal if you're not around an immediate support system like I was. Don't be ashamed or hide your pain, tell the world and help WILL find you eventually.",1

"I’m no longer living a life worth leading.I had so much potential, I had so much talent in music, in being a leader, in my spirituality, in my charisma. But I fucked it all up. My latest break up has damaged me and my spirit irreparably, it was a twin flame relationship and i fucked up so badly towards the end of the relationship. I gave away way to much of my power towards the end of the relationship, I cannot let her go. I have nothing else to go on, my sister has been living at my expense and been poisonous to me ever since I’ve been born. My dad is an alcoholic and since the divorce he basically disowned me. I have no foundation, no friends, my mental health is horrible. It’s time to go, I’m no longer serving a purpose. I would be turning 27 in July, lots of spiritual changes happen around this age. I guess I’m kinda joining the 27 club.

If I can leave you guys with anything, it’s to choose LIFE. In any situation you get yourself in ask yourself if you’re choosing life, or death, and don’t really mean this in literal terms but figuratively. Choose to be strong, stay away from drinking and drugs, I loved my life so much when I was sober. Follow your instincts, and appreciate your opportunities, don’t take them for granted because I did and no I’m out of them, I do not have any redeemable aspects to myself I am a lost cause. Choose life.

"Ever get that feeling where you want to kill yourself and you are like desperate to do it but you just have so much going on that your too depressed to die?I am getting ready to go to college and I also am working like 4 jobs and I’ve lost the only job I’ve ever felt happy doing because “it isn’t a proper job” but now I’m getting ready to go to another new college that will ruin another thing for me.

Last time it ruined working with kids this time it will ruin working with animals

And i had to leave my job at the youth center because it wasn’t a proper job apparently so now I’m free to work at a bird of prey place which I also won’t get paid for so like what’s the fucking point of it all?

"The bell tolls for me. Life used to be great but the older I got and the more I lost over time the less enjoyable it is.

My last family member died a few years ago so there is no one left that would care if I'm gone. I've lost contact with all my friends. Most of them are married and want nothing to do with me anymore. I've become antisocial. Since I lost my job and dealt with a very aggressive public in a very negative environment for the past 10 years, I've not been able to deal with people. In fact I've tried to reach out for help but can't do it. I look at other people as a problem. Just something standing in the way of happiness. I can't even carry on a conversation with others without getting fed up.

I can't drive anymore and to be honest I'm not sure why. I've tried to go to the DMV and get it fixed and they just give me a run around. I also have trouble talking to them since I've become so antisocial. It wouldn't matter if I got my license back anyway. A teenager smashed my car up. I parked it and couldn't afford the insurance on it anymore so that's beyond repair and I'll never have another car due to the mental illness I've acquired over the past decade.

I've been served an eviction notice recently. I have 5 days left to get my things and move out. I have no where to go and no one I can turn to. I can't deal with mankind any longer. Talking to others face to face is impossible.

I'm so miserable here anyway. I'm always asking myself what's the point in being here. People have told me to pray but that hasn't worked. I don't believe in a God anyway. It's not who I am. It's too late for that anyway.

I don't know why I even come here anymore. I've never asked a question here that anyone has ever given worth while advice on. Now that I think about it. People have never been able to help me with my problems. All they do is dump their problems in my lap. No one will give you the opportunity to prove yourself, to make a honest living. I need to change my life right now and I can't. I've turned my back on mankind because it's never been any use to me.

So much would have to be fixed right now for me to continue life. Words alone will not fix my problems and it is more than any one of us would have time to fix. It would take longer than I would have years left. Now I face homelessness. Being homeless in an area where there are no homeless shelters. In a place where it will take days to walk to a near by city. A walk that cannot be made without eating something.

There are too many roadblocks. All of these problems are unsolvable with the resources at my disposal.

This is not a cry for help. This is the only place I can tell others, people whom I've never met, what happened to me.

After I post this I will place this Smith and Wesson .44 magnum in my mouth and end my life. A life not fit for anyone to live.

My mental illness just like some physical ailments is terminal.

It's only fitting that there is no one here to stop me.

Death will be instantaneous, relief from the suffering will last for eternity.

"I can't do another day of life.I never amounted to much in life. I have no family left alive. My last family member died a little over 20 years ago. I've been a lone for a very long time. What makes me, me coupled with what makes me happy stands in direct conflict with what a SO would want to find in someone. I desperately need to attend college but can't afford it. I didn't know you were supposed to sign up for the draft. I had no family back then. So now I'm not eligable for financial aid. I've been turned down for every student loan and I missed a lot of days in high school because I couldn't get there everyday. So I ended up finishing high school with a very low GPA due to all the make up classes I had to take during the summer. 

I can't advance in life, I can't find a partner and I can't do the things I want to do. There is always a catch to why I can't succeed. It's time to kill myself. This life isn't really worth living.

"Rain on a White ShipRecently, a dream found me.
Raindrops pelted down from the vast blue sky, thousands of diamonds falling in abundance.
The floor of the deck was saturated with moisture; I gripped sturdily onto the handrails, watching my steps as I crossed to the other end, a destination which remained unseen.
Ghosts of the past appeared like a flash of light.
The woman that I wished was my mum.
The perfect family I yearned for.
The quiet girl whom I never got to know.
The handsome boy  whom I never once spoke to.
All of them appeared in an order, a chronological sequence to the life I never wanted to look back on. A past so pathetic that I hid my face in shame.
Everything was afloat, I was in euphoria. There was nothing weighing me down or holding me back. This must be heaven.
In a flowy white dress, I smiled, drenched in water that cleansed. Peace washed over me, as the dirt stayed behind in the sea.
The escape I could only have in a 7 hour dream.",1

"I don't know what to doHi everyone, I just joined so I don't know what to expect but here it goes. I have felt depressed since a young age and I've never really told a professional adult like a counselor or doctor or whatever. I have never wanted to die because my past self would say that I should never think like that but a little before the start of quarantine I started to think like that and every day it gets worse.  When home alone I would try and cut my wrists with the kitchen knifes because that was the sharpest thing I could get my hands on. It didn't really leave a big mark, It just looked like my cat scratched me (at the time she was still alive, R.I.P Molly). I started using the scissors in my room and that has left a mark a bit but it barely bled and then I took apart my pencil sharpener (not electric) and tried that but I stuck to the scissors and then I burned my arm with my hot glue gun and it had the burn bubbles and felt weird but now there's just a faint scar. Before I tried using everything else, when I was only using the kitchen knives, I told my mom about how I'm sad all the time for no reason and have tried to cut my wrists with the kitchen knives and she asked me if I wanted to die and at the time I didn't so I said no and she said that's good and then we hugged and I went back into my room to go to sleep. That was a couple months ago. Talking to her about that stuff was the hardest thing I have ever done. She never talked to me about it again. A couple of weeks ago I confronted her and told her that I came to her expecting to be helped because I was desperate but she thought I was just telling her how I felt just to let her know. WHAT!? IF SOMEONE COMES TO YOU AND TELLS YOU THEY HAVE BEEN SELF HARMING, YOU HELP THEM. YOU DON'T JUST SIT THERE JUST KNOWING THEY FEEL THAT WAY AND THINKING IT'S OKAY THAT YOU'RE NOT DOING ANYTHING. If you don't do anything about it, it's most likely going to lead to more and more and then wanting to die which it did. After confronting her she said that everyday we can meet and talk about how I'm feeling. The next day we didn't because she forgot and then forgot again and again and again. IS SHE ACTUALLY WORRIED ABOUT ME? I know that's stupid because I know that my mom loves me and I love her and she would never not worry about me but sometimes it feels that way. We haven't talked about it since. Am I the one who's supposed to bring it up? I don't know! sorry for the long rant, I hope someone will read this.",1

"My best friend stopped texting me for a few months, and she texted me yesterday night about her being suicidal. Saying she's a coward, and she's trying to commit to her plan to kill herself. She's trusted me to not tell anyone, and I don't know if she's going to talk to me. I don't know how to help.It's been about 2-3 months since my best friend stopped texting me. Yesterday was my birthday, and she finally said things while I was asleep. She sounds like she's on the verge of doing it.

""The only thing keeping me from doing it is my cowardness and yet the only thing truly convincing me to do it is the word coward being shouted in my head"".

""I even wrote a note once""

I'm more than worried for her. All this time she was gone, I still cared about her more than anything. I still tried to talk to her, and asked people if she was doing well. It sounds like this is the reason why she hasn't texted me. I didn't understand that, and I feel so bad for constantly still trying to talk to her. I was just another problem making it worse.

I don't know if she's going to text me again, or how long it will take. She said not to reply for 2 days, but I sent at least 50 messages when I woke up. I told her how much I care about her, and how much she means to me. I told her I knew what it was like, and we can get through this together. I begged her to reach out and talk to me because I understand. I don't even know if she's going to see all of it. She trusted me to not tell anyone because if she made it, she doesn't want to be known as the girl who couldn't commit.

She was literally planning to leave the house for the train at 2AM last night right after sending me messages. She's still ok now, but I don't know what's going to happen. I'm worried. I'm so worried. I don't know what I would if she's gone. I don't know if I can make it knowing that I couldn't reach out and help, and that I only made things worse. I don't know what i would do knowing that my best friend has left this world and I couldn't even be brave enough and understand her while I could.

What do I do? She said it's not because of her friends, and she trusted me enough to tell nobody. I don't know if i should reach out to her friends or not. I don't want to break her trust, or break her heart. What am I supposed to do? I don't know how to help. I don't know if I can live knowing she's gone and I couldn't help. 

She was my everything, and I would do anything for her. But I don't know if she will open my texts, or pick up the phone if I call her. I probably can't see her in person either, and this is tearing me apart. I'm scared. I'm worried. I want us to be happy again. She was my closest friend, and I misunderstood everything and thought it was all about me. I feel so horrible. I'm ashamed of all my letters. I don't know how to deal with this. I wanted a response from her, but not like this. I feel like the worst person ever.

"I will never feel loved.When I was younger I didn’t mind not having any relationships and just hanging out with friends was enough, now I just am thinking more and more about relationships with the other sex. I’m pretty awkward and don’t really have a lot going for myself these days, I mean who wants to get with someone who has no job, no car, not many friends and basically has no life experience or motivation to do anything I life? It is what it is I guess and I’m probably just gonna be alone forever and buy a dog and just chill watching the world go by. I have always been a loner and probably always will be which sometimes I am fine with because I enjoy my own company and enjoy doing stuff on my own time without having to run it by everyone else.

I suffer from depression, anxiety and panic attacks along with learning disabilities. I guess you could say I’m more of a liability or a burden to most people which doesn’t help the relationship situation because everyone wants a finished project instead of a work in progress and that’s cool people have standards and some people know what they want out of life and what they look for in a partner but sometimes the standards are set too high we’re your looking for perfect person which obviously doesn’t exist because we are all flawed to some extent.

I usually just drink a lot to help with the pain inside my mind because the buzz of alcohol helps me picture love (basically alcohol is the only thing that helps me feel better and think I’m loved) which I know is probably not healthy but when your at the bottom you got to have some coping mechanisms otherwise you won’t be able to go on with life. This is basically me, a nobody with no life who is left behind everyone he ever knew in life and has no motivation to do anything in life and has a lot of problems.

"What am I in store for? Concerned parent here. Hey everyone, I figured this would be a good place to ask so here goes. I am a 39-year-old father of a 13-year-old daughter who currently lives in Atlanta, while I reside in Philadelphia. To be honest, I wasn't there for 12 years and we recently reconnected and have been talking on Facebook. She came up to visit and it blew my mind how pretty she is and how cool she is at such a young age. I know I wasn't there for her as a father for 12 years but I have a second chance and I'm not going to blow it. And I know I'm lucky that she even talks to me.

My question is this, she just became a teenager recently, and she is starting seventh-grade in the fall. What do I have to look forward to as far as angst, depression, acting out, sexual experimentation, hostile behavior, etc.? I have a 22-year-old son, but I know what it was like to be a teenage boy. Teenage girls is unfamiliar territory.

I love my daughter, and lucky to have her in my life, I don't want to blow it, what can I do to be there for her? Lucky to have such cool kids and just trying to be a better dad. Any info would be appreciated. Thanks everybody, Ron from Philly.",0

"I constantly feel like killing myself, hate school with a passion, etcThis is an account I've made because my friends and I were comparing comment karma the other day, and I forgot that I'd posted on SW with my actual account, resulting in questions from friends when they found my comments on SW. 

Anyway, I'm really not that special, I'm like everyone on this sub. 

 I hate my life, I wake up, cry thinking about how ugly I am and how high my voice is (I have a phobia of being photographed because I'm soooo ugly) I go to school, fall sort of asleep, walk a mile and a bit in -22 degree weather to my moms work. Wait 1 and 1/2 hours till my mom is done and drives me home. 

I go home, play mortal kombat, rip people apart in gruesome ways, beat the shit out of people, consider how fucking awesome being a real martial artist would be. I do a bit of homework, play league of legends with friends, consider how much I (and about 50 percent of the games playerbase) suck at the game, think about what being a pro gamer or designer would be like(to bad I suck at programming, and actually playing games).  Do more homework and cry myself to sleep.  

Sometimes I think doing shit would be cool.  This weekend I went to a farmers market with friends (and visited the nearby outlet mall) I got accused of stealing, opened my pockets to some cash and my phone, the manager awkwardly shuffled away as my friends and I stared at him. 
I found it to be very funny.  I should have said something witty, though.
Then we went to wal mart, played basketball in the aisles, as the employees laughed and didn't give a damn.  It was the best like I actually did something very neat experience.  

But this is never the case.  I love movies, I hatched a perfect plan - get a camera - shoot videos - go to film school learn MMA, be happy or the closest emotion to happy that I can achieve.  So my mom got me a camera thinking maybe I'd stop the despair I live through. 

I loved it, noticed I can't use a DSLR properly, and now it sits on a bedside table because I can't bring myself to learn to use it, because I consider how much homework I have, but when I'm not doing homework I  destroy people on a computer screen, I don't learn how to use my camera.

This is how every idea goes for me. "" I should get a hobby or something""  ""No man, way too much homework."" ""Wow I have no homework, time to play video games"". 

Anyway, my question is, why live life, it seems like a torture method before you're liberated from hell by old age or cancer.

"Existing vs. livingI'm in a downswing yet again and ruminating about my failures. While doing so I read an article about depression and suicide. In it the author spoke about little things in your life, things you do that are positive and beneficial to other people. How you make the world a brighter place with the smallest things. And that's true. I can count many things today and yesterday that other people have done to make me smile. Despite everything going on, I still see kindness and purity in the souls of a few people. I try to be that same light or ray of sunshine for others too.

I could continue to do that indefinitely. I could scrap the idea of suicide and continue to live out my unfulfilling life and be the person I became in the wake of my trauma and make people happy. I could bring light in that way.

But it would continue to kill me like it's been killing me for over half a year now, bits and pieces of my psyche coming apart a little at a time. I had my first ever breakdown a few weeks ago. I'm not doing so good. I've decided to stop talking about it to the people I care about. I can't escape it.

Back to my point. Could I continue to live and make other people happy, comfort them, help them? Yes.

But... for the first time I ask, what about me? What about MY happiness? The only thing I ever wanted I can never have. Doing other things is just existing, not living. I have a need to feel alive and no one understands this. Without this thing, life is pointless to me. I get no personal satisfaction, no joy. It's not worth living. I look on at those who have this thing and I am filled with self-hate and disgust and inferiority. I cannot take, cannot stomach the thought of just existing like this for years. I feel like screaming until I lose my voice, that is how painful it is.",1

"Losing my mind with what I can only hope is anti depressant withdrawalWent a bit nuts with anxiety a few months ago and was put on Mirtazapine. It made me super chubby and I didn't think it was doing anything, so my doctor said it was fine to come off cold turkey because I was on 15mg.

Fast forward 16 days later and apparently that was a terrible idea. I've lost 4kg in two weeks, I can't eat, I feel tense every day all day. 

Yesterday it escalated and I had what I imagine is a severe panic attack on a London bus. I was white, shaking, sweating and consumed with fear and desperation to die.

After going home, it just didn't disappate. I feel completely unreal, keep being jolted by a feeling of electric shocks and can't bear any sensory stimulation whatsoever.

I haven't gone outside. I called the doctor today (my normal one isn't there) and she said withdrawal from anti depressants isn't a thing so this is just me. I'm praying she's wrong. Tiny noises sound so loud, I'm so sensitised and terrified of everything. I'm taking today and tomorrow off work (I have Friday booked off anyway). I'm supposed to get a 1 hour bus and then 1 hour train tomorrow to see my boyfriend who wants to look after me. I just can't handle it.

If taking a dose would definitely work I'd do it in a second and then taper off slowly, but it's been 16 days and I'? scared of making it worse, and scared of what I might do. Please, please can anyone help?",1
"The words ""I want to die"" constantly go through my head.I can't live like this anymore. Literally the only number I ever call is the national suicide prevention hotline.

I have nothing but failure tied to my name and I don't have any friends. I hate waking up in the morning, I hate going about my day which usually consists of nothing.  

I have nothing but failure on my record, I barely made it out of high school, I joined the military and didn't even make it past boot camp and now I'm stuck at home again. The same place that I wanted to get away from. 

I was recently accepted into a college but I don't want to go. I can't bring myself to do it. I'm absolutely awful in an academic setting. I'm a fucking idiot. I can't do a god damn thing right.
Obviously socially I'm no better. I'm 18, never held a girl's hand, never kissed a girl, etc. 

I try to improve myself by taking up new hobbies but I've only just failed time and time again. All I do is fail. I'm not capable of doing anything great.

All I've done is fail over and over. I'm known as the dumbass of my family. My brother knows it, I know it, everyone fucking knows it. I'm not capable of anything. I'm a nobody. Why the fuck do I even have social media accounts? None of my posts ever got any recognition and now I just don't bother posting anything.

I have no shame. I have done countless pathetic things because I'm just that fucking dumb and easily become jealous of other people's lives. Everyone is so happy and living joyful lives. What have I got? Not a god damn thing. I just want to die. Every day is more lonely than the last. I can't live like this.

I have done nothing but get in the way of other people. I'm hopeless. What the fuck is wrong with me. God damnit, I want to die. I can't continue to live like this. Please, I can't take this anymore, I'm just a lost cause. 

Alcohol is the only thing that lets me feel any sort of emotion. I drink until I can cry an then I just fall asleep and repeat the same thing the next day. I'm such a pathetic excuse for a human being. I'm not capable of anything.

"So, the time has comeI'm tired of this endless pain. I'm tired of this loneliness. People don't seem to fully understand what's going on with me. I can't blame them, since I've always been the class clown. I also never had the courage to honestly tell anyone what I'm feeling.

I won't give full details of why I'm going to kill myself, since this would take an eternity, but I won't leave you with nothing. Two years ago I was living abroad, studying what I loved. Everything was going great until I started to realise that was not what I really enjoyed studying. Working in that area would be a nightmare. But I still managed to finish my 1-year program and come back home. I was happy to see my family and friends again, since I was rather lonely there. But when I returned to college in my home town, I had the same doubts about my future. I didn't (and still don't) have a good perspective in life. Anyway, I was close to graduating, so I would just grab my diploma and sort things out once I did this. Running away from my problems was a mistake; I just lost a lot of time unhappy.
Fast forward to last semester. I was depressed. I realised I was incapable of making new friends, and nearly everyone who fitted in this concept before were actually people who tolerated me to the point of going out together. I still have a few good friends, but they are always busy, and we barely see each other. My mom always told me to make an effort to accomplish my everyday activities. Leaving my house was a struggle, but she couldn't see that I was sick. My father and brother were clueless. I was still having problems in the uni (my grades got worse). As a consequence of returning to a 3rd world country after living a year in the UK, I couldn't take it anymore. I wanted to move, as soon as possible. But it would be nearly impossible to get a visa or an opportunity outside of my country soon. So, I'll have to live in this shit-hole for a while.

I wanted to do this some time ago, but my brother was studying hard (harder than he ever had) to enter the university. I didn't want to cause him pain in the most important time of his life.

I don't have basic human interactions on most days. I just sleep, eat, read or play something for a while and go to sleep again. Sometimes I just can't sleep at all. Now, I'm alone in my house for the weekend. I'm buying a rope today and will hang myself tomorrow. I gave myself enough time to enjoy life, but apparently this is an impossible task. I have failed more than I should in life, but this time I'll succeed.

To sum up: I hate where I live; I hate my graduation; I hate my lack of social abilities; I hate being a shitty son, brother and friend; I hate having no talent whatsoever; I hate being a shitty student; I hate being who I am and, most of all, I hate being depressed and never having motivation to get out of bed and deal with the aforementioned issues.

I'd like to take some time from my last moments to say Thank you to everyone in this subreddit. I'm a long time lurker and you helped me through some pretty nasty moments, even if your comments were not directed to me. I'm sorry for my shitty English, it's not my first language and I'm not as competent in expressing myself as I should. Also, this was written in a moment of despair, so my writing may not be concise and cohesive. Believe me, understanding my own feelings is as hard as reading my post.
Just so you all know, your comments won't have any effect on what I'll do to myself tomorrow. I'll probably just take a quick look at my reddit today or tomorrow morning, but this is already decided. However, if you want to leave nice comments, feel free, since some depressed lurkers may find help in them.

"i have never been this suicidal in my lifein 18 years i have never thought about suicide as much as i have these past few months. it’s like it’s the number 1 thing on my mind all the time. i don’t have any goals anymore. my dad doesn’t understand what i’m going through and he really doesn’t even try. i have no idea who i am anymore, i look in the mirror and don’t recognize myself. i am struggling and nobody seems to notice. i have my plan ready to go i just have to stop being such a pussy and just do it. i cannot continue like this. it’s just agony.

"I want to die so intensely.I'm 22, female, college student. I signed up a few months ago for an internship program staying at an ecological farm in Israel. I raised money for the trip and I was extremely excited, but the internship turned out to be a disaster, as I was allergic to literally everything on the farm (to the point of going into shock). I'm currently staying with relatives and I'm pretty sick and recovering from the reactions, being on prescribed medication.

The program coordinators said they would put me in another program, where I'd have an internship at a history museum. I was extremely excited, but became nervous because the program said my initial deposit was non-refundable (even with medical circumstances) and for this new program (where I'd be living in Jerusalem, having a food stipend), the deposit would be an additional $400.

They were also very cagey about answering questions on the classes I was required to take, the sort of programming that would be available, and it took multiple emails over several days to finally get a sample itinerary for the trip. I wanted to make sure I knew exactly what I was getting into, before I dropped more money. Seeing it convinced me, and I was ready to pay.

And literally, someone paid an hour before me, taking the last spot.
Now I'm here in Israel, sick with relatives who are getting annoyed with me, I have to rearrange my flight schedule, and I spent $1,200 on a flight ticket that turned out to be worthless and all I want to do is cry and throw myself off a bride. I came here to escape an abusive household, I came here for an exciting experience at a prestigious institution (I'm a poor scholarship student who never went on a vacation because I was always working, this took quite a chunk from my savings), and I ended up wasting time and money and I have such a complex when it comes to money.

I feel like such a worthless idiot and I wish the allergy reactions did their work and just kill me there because then I wouldn't have to go home to the shame that my narcissist mother will give me for being an idiot, for being a cowardly idiot, and for wasting everyone's time and money and not even being well enough to go explore the cities while I have a chance.

I always prided myself on being meticulous and making sure I always did the perfect, correct decision and making sure I didn't give any fuel for my parents to make fun of me or tell me why I'm worthless, and all I did here was be a stupid, selfish idiot. ",1

"I don't really want anything. There is very little that I want. I have a fairly active social life (by my introverted standards), I do well in school, my parents care about me and will financially support me throughout college, etc.; by many standards I have a great life.

However, since high school I've had this pervasive sense of apathy that, at times, mutates into this sense of sheer dread. Usually, this is brought on by thinking about any long-term plans. I just don't want anything for myself.

There is an exception, though. I'm dating a wonderful girl, and have been for over two years. She came into my life at a very low point, and stood by me as I grappled with depression induced by a hopeless situation. My sister suffers from paranoid schizophrenia, and was diagnosed while I was approximately 7. She changed from someone I could play games with to a passive-aggressive, untrustworthy frightening person.

Over the next decade, a ton of events built up that made me a very paranoid person. The most vivid and damaging for me, but it sounds really petty and childish now. When I was I guess 10 or so, the game Animal Crossing had just come out and I'd gotten it for my birthday. The Gamecube was in my room, and I would come home from school at 4 every day and play it. But my sister would get home from school at 3, and would go into my room (privacy was always an issue for us) and do absolutely every activity available in the game for that day, leaving nothing for me. I talked to her about it, but she refused to even only do half the things. My parents wouldn't enforce anything. I started hiding the disc, but she would tear my room apart until she found it, and then played it and again prevented me from doing anything in the game.

Over time, many small actions, and a few big ones, I became incapable of trusting or bonding with people in any meaningful way. I constantly fear I myself am developing the disorder. I've self-diagnosed myself with schizoid personality disorder (I know how unreliable those are, though), which has a fairly high chance of progressing into full-blown schizophrenia, especially in siblings of afflicted individuals.

This is very rambly. I'm honestly disgusted with my writing tonight, I'm sorry to whomever is choosing to sift through it. But I appreciate it. I think this is a really great subreddit. I think you are the best people on this site.

Anyway, I have a hard time trusting people. Going back home to my family for holidays is one of the most stressful things in my life. I at times feel like I hate my sister for depriving me of my childhood. I feared her. I had to restrain my behaviors, I didn't want to draw attention so that she wouldn't interact with me and say something judgmental or do something to hurt me somehow. I'm still dealing with these repercussions today. I fear having attention on me from someone I perceive as judgmental. Speaking in class, for example, causes me to turn a bright shade of red, to the point where I don't bother.

Anyway, my girlfriend saved me during my senior year of high school, when I was so depressed I developed a plan to kill myself. I had done enough research to know just how unfeasible and downright stupid a lot of methods are. So to have any chance of actually succeeding and not just leaving myself comatose and a burden on my family or something, I had to wait until I was 18 to purchase the materials. I will not go into detail here, I don't want anyone reading this to get ideas. there's apparently some asshole here doing that enough as it is.

She got me through that, and things were good, for me. I felt happy sometimes. I hadn't felt happy in years. It's nice. But a year later, in freshman year of college, we broke up. We're a long-distance relationship by this point, about two hours apart. Over a period of mere days I crashed back down. I wanted to die again. I've never really wanted to live, mind you, but that's different. So I resolved to do it over the summer. 

But we got back together. We got over the problems that caused us to break up. However, we've been having more problems now, caused entirely by her jealousy over someone who she's never met and just assumes based on like 3 facebook events is trying to steal me away from her, despite her having her own boyfriend of even longer than I've been with my girlfriend. My girlfriend gets angry whenever she does anything on my facebook (which is very rare now) or I mention being somewhere with her or any other time her name comes up. She utterly refuses to acknowledge any points I make to show how the girl isn't interested in destroying us. Like, I told her that she told me she wasn't interested in dating anyone else if her relationship doesn't work. My girlfriend responded ""how noble of her to say that."" I said ""so no one can say that and mean it? you've said that to me"" and she said ""And I want to be with you. Do you see my point?"" But that doesn't make sense. I responded ""You said that about me. And you want to be with me. She said that about her boyfriend. Thus, logically, that means she wants to be with her boyfriend, not me."" But my girlfriend just said ""I can't talk about this any more tonight."" She ALWAYS says that whenever I say anything that she can't argue against. It's wearing me down. I don't know how much longer we're going to make it. She also threw back in my face the reason we broke up freshman year, which was about my jealousy over a guy who was ACTUALLY interested in her.

I have severe codependence issues with her, I think. Since she basically saved me, my only goal in life was to be with her and support her for the rest of my life. I wanted to get a job and raise a family with her and whatnot, which is my sole source of motivation. When she and I fight, everything just stops. I have enough willpower to last me about a week, and usually by then she'll have dropped the argument and made me think we've gotten over it when we really haven't, in her eyes.

I think we're going to break up soon, and I have very mixed feelings about that. I want to be with her. I want to leave her for her seemingly manipulative nature. Sometimes the past few months when I'm driving home I want to just turn the wheel toward a tree or off a bridge. 

Nothing really makes me happy. I tried antidepressants. The side-effects nearly killed me. I hate myself for the way I treat my sister. One time she went off her meds she was knocking at my door trying to tell me she loved me. 

I thought it was a trap.

She ran away that day. A few days later cops found her and she had split her head open somehow. She was put into a mental hospital again. She's fine now. But I hate myself for the way I treated her. And still do. I don't trust her. I can't stand to be around her. She acts like she wants to make amends, but she's either incapable of recognizing how she makes people feel (a legitimate symptom of her disorder) or she's trying to manipulate me (a legitimate and historically correct answer). I'm a paranoid sort of person, so I assume it's the latter and stay guarded. I hate that.

I just dont' look forward to anything anymore. I have no desire to do anything, and wouldn't really mind if everything just stopped. I'm not likely to just go and kill myself tomorrow or anything. But I wouldn't mind if I were to have an accident somehow.

"That's enough for me.In my life I went through really awful stuff. As a child growing up without my father who left me, living with my mother and her abusive husband, being beaten and humiliated by both of them, seeing my mother get spanked by him, being sexually abused by this same guy with my mother knowing it and doing nothing, having suicidal thoughts since I was 10y.o., fleeing home to live with my grandmother, meeting my father when I was 13y.o. and finding he was indeed an asshole that never gave a fuck about me, I turned out to be a very introvert, lonely, depressed and distrustful person.

Living with my grandmother was kind of a turning point for me. Even being depressed and psychologically fucked up I managed to achieve some cool stuff. I got into one of the best universities in Brasil to study computer science, got to work as a math and physics teacher in a school to make some money and started an indie game development company with some friends.

But about a year ago, I completely broke down. I couldn't focus on studying or working and couldn't get up from bed. At the same time I developed anxiety disorders, having panic attacks every morning, a growing OCD really strong and eating a lot, what got me really fat. My self-esteem, which was already low, got to zero. I entered into a really profound depression. I quit college. My life basically ended. This went on until I tried committing suicide without success thanks to my grandmother who fortunately got home from work earlier.

After this I started treating myself and got much better. Returned to college and reengaged contact with some friends. This went on for almost 3 months of living an almost normal life, even if I couldn't help but wonder every time about how empty I felt inside. I started feeling bad again and my grandmother got sick, and just the thought of being alone and losing the only person that really stands by me no matter what made me broken. I felt lonely, miserable and pretty much like before when I tried committing suicide.

What brings me now. Today is my birthday and I'm turning 21. Not a single person showed up, called me or congratulated me on fb, whatsapp or whatever. I really am alone. I really am miserable. I can no more withstand this much suffering and am seriously considering suicide. Think I could use some advice from you guys. I'm completely desperate. Please, no ""things will get better"" stuff 'cause they don't. Sorry for eventual English mistakes.

Thanks for reading.

"I'm not gonna kill myselfI have no intention of killing myself. I do not want to die. I love my life. I love being alive! 

Everyday I think about killing myself. Sometimes it sounds like a very stupid idea. Other days I feel like I might just slip away and fall in to death comfortably, like I won't miss being alive at all.

I don't wanna kill myself. I want to live. Sometimes I feel so worthless that I think I don't deserve to live. I think I'm so disgustingly ugly that I don't want anyone to see my body. I just wanna get away. How do I escape my life? I need away for a minute. The things I need to escape from are the things I live the most. They hurt my heart and make me feel sad. 

When I have nothing to do and I'm just at home, a deep dread rises in my chest. I feel no motivation to live. I just want out of the house. I wanna get away. I have to wait until the day is over and I go to work the next day. On days where I stay home, I feel like my life isn't worth living. There is nothing for me on the planet and no one cares about me. 

I am upset. I just wanna be myself. I feel like everyone is constantly judging me. I'm not good enough. I'm not pretty enough. I'm too stupid or rude or annoying or clingy.... I want people to like me and understand me. I want them to give me a chance. 

I don't hate my body anymore, and I think it's very pretty. I'm by no means sexy, but I am beautiful. I have a nice face and good hair. I wish my boobs and butt were bigger..... 

Sometimes I wanna get diagnosed, because I think I have some mental disorder. I'm not normal. I process information a lot differently than most people. I'm smart, but I don't handle emotions like most people do. I want to get diagnosed, so I can understand and feel validated. Like, why did I used to have panic attacks or think someone was watching me? Why don't I anymore? Why am I depressed? Why am I so socially awkward? I like people. Why can't I talk to them? Why do I feel like I have some form of autism or something? (Not to be insensitive to people with autism. I don't think I have autism. I just feel like I have something.) I can't always understand social cues or when something is a joke.... The list goes on. Idk what is wrong with me.

Anyways, I haven't been diagnosed, but I think I have depression. I don't wanna treat it with medication. I feel like I should only treat it with meds if I actually wanna commit suicide. I want to learn to cope with it on my own. Looking back, I think I've had it since I was in about fourth grade.

I'm not gonna kill myself, but I think about it often. I think about how I would do it or who would care. I don't talk about it much anymore, because I am tired of whining about my feelings to people. I just wanna be real and be mature. I don't want to rely on anyone else to cope with my feelings. I just wanna let my feelings go.",1

I don't know how much more I can take, I just failed getting into a good university, I think that I will have no future now... I fucked up badly and I don't feel like there's a reason for me to live anymore. It just keeps getting worse and I can't anymore. I really wish that people would just stop caring about me, because every time when I wanted to do it, I remembered how much I will hurt my parents and one of my best friends who sadly... cares too much about me. I will never understand why I can't be like everyone else, have a happy life, a lot of friend and someone special... instead all what I get is having to live this hell every day.

"It really does feel like I'm coming to an endThis post was originally meant for /r/depression but to be quite honest I've thought about killing myself years ago, after multiple failed college attempts and string of part time hotel gigs interrupted by depression.  My parents were gracious enough to keep my incompetence under their roof for so long, but they're growing old and tired of my failure to launch.

I turn 29 in a couple weeks.  I have a back full of withered discs, and years out from achieving any level of skill that would give me financial autonomy without physical labor.  This pathetic bed of failure would be perfectly fine to lay in if I could keep my one reason to continue - the love of my life.

"It's such a calming feeling once you've made up your mindOnce the path forward becomes crystal-clear in your mind, it is such a calm, peaceful feeling.

I feel less anxiety right now than I've felt in over 15 years.  I feel like I could lie down and sleep like a baby.  The path forward is so clear now after the news I got this morning.  Any and all doubts have been washed away from my mind, almost like a baptism.  A rebirth.  A cleansing of the soul.

I can go now because it all really and truly is exactly how I thought it was.  It was never ""just the depression talking"" or ""the lies of depression"".  It was all the truth.

"whywere all going to die, its something we cant escape. why postpone it. why even care about what you do when you wont remember or even be capable of remembering after all is said and done. lifes just been shit to me. ive been failing school for as long as I can remember, and it got so bad I retook 2nd grade. 2nd. grade. nothing has gotten better. at one point, my high school gpa was 0.8/4(5, special circumstances). im not going to be any use to society and it shows. I already have committed tax evasion, multiple accounts of federal crimes, and assault and im only 18. once the police find out of what ive done im going to jail for my life. that's not a life worth living for or worth the time to run from. 

its funny, from a very young age, doctors have actually said im just going to end up growing up to be a criminal or in jail. my mom says im like my dad (hes abusive, a hardcore drug addict, you name it) and frankly im starting to believe her. were just going to end up living on the streets anyways being shes over 20k in credit card debt just to feed us. if I die, that's just 1 less mouth to feed. 1 less person to fight with about going to school (yes, im still in highschool). and no, I don't get bullied or anything at school. that has nothing to do with it. still, everything is stacked against me. im probably just going to end up killing somebody or something anyways because im prescribed multiple drugs (most I don't even bother taking) whos living the life of a pill. and it sucks. it really sucks. and I know nothing is going to get better because you cant get anything as a highschool dropout (theyre just going to kick me out anyways for acting out in class and stuff and fighting) even if I wanted to stay. hell, if I even decided to stay in school, I wont have enough credits to pass if I ace everything, ill be that retard whos 19 and still in high school. 

so, why even bother? what is there to accomplish when you have a crystal ball of your future and you know its just a downward spiral?",1

I attempted suicide the first time when I was 11. I am gay. My entire family disowned me when I was 16 due to homophobia masked by religion; I am dead to them. I have little friends. 

I am going to make this as painless for her as possible and tape the letter to the door along with a piece of paper urging her to please not enter. She knows how low I am; she will understand what that means. I can only hope she heeds the warning. 

I will do it tomorrow shortly after she leaves for work. I will use my method while smoking cigarettes. As it enters my system and takes effect, I am certain it will be unpleasant at best, and painful at worst.  She hates cigarettes, despises the entire habit, but that is what I want to do. Smoke a pack of cigarettes.  

I have no reason to feel this way. I simply do. Always have. I am so tired. ",1

"It’s my birthday today and I’ve cried for the majority of it.My school had a few Covid cases so I’m stuck inside self isolating for 2 weeks. I was planning to go out with friends on this day, who are unaware of the state I’m in or how I feel most of the time. I don’t like to share things with people, I’m quite selective when it comes to that. I had someone (an online person), I haven’t really heard from them in a few days (not too sure why, it has worried me) and from this I’ve realised I’m fragile and incapable of operating correctly on my own. I tell myself that I’m coping but my ways of coping are just getting on whilst still carrying my heavy mind and having the urge to cry constantly. I was planning to do some work for school before the end of the week but I feel slightly unmotivated and every time I try and even think, I burst out into tears. I have many thoughts that plague my mind.

I have attempted previously, this shook my entire family, who were completely unaware about how I felt. They were devastated, made them cry. If they weren’t here, I would have been gone a longgg time ago. A couple years after I thought I had improved so much, and boy was I wrong. I feel as though I know myself more and I’m in fact weak.

"can't stand the fortunateIf somebody starts telling me about their relationships or their friends or the social groups they belong to, I nearly tear up. Granted, I barely ever talk to anyone, but even just reading about happy people sends me over the edge. I'm miserable. I have never once had a positive relationship with anyone. I have never dropped my guard for anything. I don't know how to. And, because I'm a man, I was never exposed to anything that could have helped me become more socially competent. I'm not even human. Human beings are defined by how they socialize with each other. I don't socialize. I get my thrills by talking to myself; that's the closest thing I have to a fucking friendship. I'm too poor and too disabled to ever improve my circumstances, and yet I'm surrounded by happy people.

And the worst thing about it is that those same happy people will insist that they know how I feel, and try to pin personal responsibility on me for my sadness. No one understands how bad I have it, no one cares that I have it this bad, and no one will ever feel enough attachment to me to want to help in a productive or kind way. Meanwhile, everyone else gets to go to parties and experiment with their sexuality and experiment with hedonism and develop identities based on how they contrast themselves with others. They get to be humans. All I am is a broken shell with a prognosis in my 30's.

"I don't know what to doMy wife and I have both been severely depressed, to the point of suicidality. I'm 29, she's 26. I learned about two years ago that I am transgender. So I feel like I have found a way to ""cure"" my depression, but my cure is to transition and it is making her more depressed.  I haven't started any medical transition yet, but I have been transitioning socially for about 8 months. And my depression is lower and less frequent now than it has been in years, I feel like I really am doing the right thing for my own mental health.

My wife tries to be supportive. She uses my preferred pronouns and outwardly supports me, but it's killing her inside. She won't talk to me about it because she says I'm too sensitive and defensive about it. She has also said that I'm becoming narcissistic, and I can see what she means. I recognize the behaviors in myself and I'm trying not to be, but I think it stems from my trying to fight the shame of being trans that I've felt most of my life. My wife is openly bisexual (she came out right after I came out as trans) but she has never had a relationship with a woman. She has also been diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder, which makes her very hard on herself and gives her severe social anxiety. So she has nobody to talk to because she has no friends and isn't very close to her family. She's a very intelligent person, she just got her Masters degree and is going to get a PhD.  She also told me this morning that people with BPD have around an 80% suicide attempt rate. And that it is basically on her mind all the time.

I really really don't know what to do. I've found a treatment for my depression, but it's making her's worse. We've been married about 5 years and have talked about getting a divorce multiple times. But I'm afraid that if we ever actually did, the rejection would literally kill her. Or if not it would traumatize her so severely she wouldn't be able to recover from it.

Attempting to make sense of it all in chronological order

**Earliest suicidal thought**\- 2005- 12 years old. Wrote down all the ways I could kill myself in the back of my geography notebook. From what I can remember, things like injecting myself with air into my veins and learning about how it can cause death. I made a list of about 8-10 things. Hanging myself, poisoning myself. Why did I do it? I’m really not sure. 

I was depressed about being overweight, being terrible in school, not having many friends. I ended up failing the 7th grade that year. I was so upset. I was in disbelief and overall just crushed. 

2006-2014

A year later, things weren’t much better. Talking about this seems irrelevant since it was so long ago, but I think that’s how It all began. Those feelings of just being crushed, isolated and defeated stuck around longer than they should have. I’m not sure why I wasn’t able to have some sort of appropriate coping mechanism for it all. Down the line, those mechanisms were working out emotionally in hopes to forget and numb the pain and put a pause on an issue I haven’t dealt with. With that came self-harm. 

None of that cutting shit, but punishing myself for the smallest things. if I failed something, felt bad about something or just felt inadequate in some shape or form I would punch myself enough to make it hurt, but not enough to leave lasting marks. I figured blunt force would be enough to punish myself for whatever reasons I thought I was doing, or wasn’t doing. It’s been a while since I’ve done that, but I took it a little too far trying to hang myself on my 21st birthday( Ironic, I know). 

In hindsight, using a belt in a closet with a rack that’s shorter than you isn’t logistically sound. I tried bending my knees and crouching with the belt around my neck. I tried a few more times that day, but didn’t work out. Can’t say I’m glad it didn’t as I write this. Maybe I need better planning at executing this, or I could just use the excuse that it’s another thing I’ve failed to accomplish in my life. 

I honestly didn’t think I’d feel worse now than I did a few years ago and it honestly scares me. My thoughts of suicide and just ending it all come up more frequently than they used to. Some day’s it doesn’t even come up, but even when I actively try to draw attention away from these thoughts, I can count on them coming up the next day, or the day after that. Nevertheless, they never truly leave me. Call them demons or thoughts, but they’re with perpetually with me. I grew up with them, moved to the US with them and graduated with them. This isn’t really a cry for help, because I take responsibility for these thoughts and the actions that may take place as a result of them. Maybe I’ll be around long enough to figure “it” out, or whatever I think “it” is. Depression, suicidal ideations, anxiety; whatever you call it. I don’t like being a victim, which is another reason I don’t really think about reaching out for help. Maybe that’s the exact definition of victim, depending on who you ask. 

&amp;#x200B;

But in the next few years, I’ll either be here or I won’t. I really can’t say right now with certainty. That’s something no one can say with certainty. The only difference is whether It will be through my own hands or through natural causes. On days like this, I tell myself I don’t want to die, and I honestly believe myself at times. Or it could be that I’m just believing a convenient lie for the sake of self-preservation. I don't want to die, I really don't. I'd like to be a father one day and be somewhat successful and try to do good in the world, but I don't think this will happen.

"My Weird kink 

Credit: u/potheadboyz


So I have a super weird kink. I like my women a bit on the insane side. To be more specific, it turns me on if a girl holds a knife to my neck (in a joking way of course, interpret that how you will) it turns me on especially if we're making out or having sex. Also kinda turns me on if she treats me like property, like I belong to her (now I don't mean she uses me as a wallet). I know this is an unrealistic kink and there is no one in the world like this but it's  something I fantasize about. Probably one of the weirdest kinks ever.

"Why is it so wrong to commit suicide?I don't get it. Why is it seen as such a bad thing to commit suicide--people treat it like the plague. People have literally told me they won't let me die, and I can't give up, there's so much to look forward too blah bla. Why do they see it as so wrong? Why do they make me stay alive when I want to die so desperately. Maybe because I'm suicidal I never understood the stigma and fear towards it.",1
"I'm going to overcome my Avpd and agoraphobia to kill myselfAs the title states, I'm going to overcome my AvPD and agoraphobia to buy some rope, travel to another country to see a band and afterwards I'm going to hang myself. I have nothing to live for, so why bother trying. It'll probably be a few months before I can do this, but that gives me some time to prepare and get everything in order. I'm so tired of fighting everyone, the government, myself, the world. It is very clear now, I just wasn't meant to live. The universe has made it painfully obvious.",1
"I can't face the consequences of my actionsI have always had a problem with throwing tantrums and screaming at people whenever I feel upset or angry. Now, I had one and got into really serious trouble for it because I insulted someone based on his race directly and explicitly. He was innocent and I had absolutely no reason to say that.

My chances of having any type of career now are pretty much zero. Everyone will just think I'm a dirtbag human being. I can't accept what I did and I can't deal with the consequences. I will probably end up homeless. Killing myself gives me an escape. People are so angry that it doesn't make sense to try to fix my anger and abusive thinking problems because they won't care. I knew I was being cruel.",1
"My attempt at a simple nearly-universal meaning to life.I had an epiphany today. After months of trying to find purpose to life and find a meaning to my life it suddenly hit me. You see, as soon as we understand the concept of death as human beings, a sub-concious decision is made for us to choose life over death. Simple evidence for this is that you are currently reading this when you could instead be ending your life. You have an open decision but you will have a natural bias to side towards life. The key to finding a meaning to life is to make a concious decision on this question of life and death. Indeed, you could easily choose either and this does not necessarily mean life or death in a physical form but rather a state of mind. For example, you may choose death and still be alive but be completely obssessed with the idea of suicide. However, when you realize your sub-concious decision to live, it seems natural to choose life over death. Futhermore, once you make this choice conciously, that is all the purpose you need in life. Indeed, you may ask yourself ""why do I live?"" and you will realize that you simply live to fullfill your concious decision to pick life over death. Hence, whenever you seem to be straying off the path of ""life"", I suggest to always reconsider your sub-concious decision to live and to align your conciousness along with it. This may seem like an overly simplified version at my attempt of giving meaning to my life but I hope this idea may help a few of you reading this. TL;DR You have already made the decision to live sub-conciously, hence this should provide enough of a reason to choose life in a concious state of mind.",1

I've gotten to a point in my life where I've realized I'm no longer even believing I can possibly have a future. Every new swing into depression is a step down the asymptote towards killing myself (fuck, that's a heavy thing to write). Honestly, the minimal traffic is what attracted me to posting here. I don't think there's any way fucking Reddit could stop me from doing this, but I personally need the catharsis. I don't get joy out of my days anymore, I don't even like to listen to music because it reminds me of how far from enjoying it I've come. I can smoke weed and forget, induce myself into chemical numbness for a few hours, but really, it's just getting closer and fucking closer. Every new day is just a higher probability that I won't see the next. Fuck, this was a stupid place to put this. I don't expect to be around much longer but it was good to get this off my chest.",1

"Barely able to post thisI'm sick of myself, today, my friend told me he'd start a fight with my other friend because of some outrageous complications, i didn't think he was serious until after school, in a pick up area, he attacked my other friend. I could have stopped it, I could have spread peace and ended it, but instead i cowered behind my best friend and made comical commentary about it, i felt sick to my stomach immediately, i thought of how much a hero i could have been, at that one second, but i let my friends down, i let all i love down, this, mixed with other personal problems caused some suicidal thoughts in my mind, i am seriously debating whether i should end it or not, i just can't believe i didn't stop that fight, that hurts me badly. My thoughts are strong, and I'm barely holding on, i don't know who to go to or who to talk to about my thoughts because i'm ashamed about it and about the fight. I just got home and while debating to do it or not, i looked into my mom's eyes and almost immediately started crying. i could have been a hero at school, now i'm a coward. Why am i so troubled?",1

It kills me that she’s never going to see her kids get married or graduate. God, I can’t even sleep at night anymore and I’m not even exaggerating. I feel so guilty, I don’t know how her daughters can even stand to look at me. I don’t know how I even made it this far. I would do anything to switch places with her, my god I would do it in a heartbeat. She has so many people who miss her and I’m only 13, it’s not like I’ve made an incredible life choice yet. It’s not like I’m married or have kids. I just don’t know how long I can go without just ending it. I need to die.

"What, why, how, and whenMental health has been evaluated, treated, and reevaluated. Medication does nothing but make me numb to the things around me. It doesn't last long.  My one and only baby was a stillborn at 38 weeks. That's literally weeks away from being born. I've been dead inside ever since. Absolutely nothing makes the pain go away. I've tried.  I researched and came up with a plan. I will take a drill and make a few holes around the catalytic converter. I will make a playlist and roll up the windows inside of the garage. I will put danger notices on the outside of the garage door.  This is my 3rd try. First, was my sister in laws gun. A pink sparkly thing I felt weird holding. I called the hotline and they tracked me. I went to the hospital and I was treated like an animal. The second time I got sleeping pills, but had a change of heart and took 2 weeks to try and be happy. This time is different. I'm calm, totally ready, and actually relieved that it will be over very soon.

"Close yet so farSuicidal Ideation has run though my head almost daily for more than half a decade. I cannot seem to escape it for more than half a month at best. Some days are particularly bad such as yesterday and which push me from thought into minor action - buying pills, looking up the process to get a gun or the best methods of suicide (like I dont already know). I've come to a realization that even though I feel so close to doing it, I am actually quite far from it. All it would take to back me out of it is thinking what my parents would do without their only child, what my future self could accomplish, and how my problems really aren't that large to tackle. 

My biggest issue is my lack of sexual experiences. Sex sex sex is all that runs through most men's heads around my age but for me I stunted. I've always been behind the curve while simultaneously being surrounded by and hearing stories from the top of the top. Its even harder to deal with because on the surface it seems like I could be great at it yet I still flounder. I've generally been apathetic towards the whole thing in the past 2 years but then a day like yesterday will come and knock me out of it hard. Then I think about lost time, lost experience, compare myself to others, and imagine the day I blow my brains out. But today is not the day. Tomorrow is not the day. One day I'll get good with girls because if I dont I will definitely kill myself one of these days and it's sad because at the same time I know I'd regret it, logically.",1

I help where I can, cleaning and doing dishes, cooking, but nothing I can do is something they can't do better.  All my friends live very far away from me and don't keep in touch. I feel like my entire life is superfluous. Nobody needs me, nobody is benefited by my existence. There's nothing I can offer to anyone. These thoughts haunt me every day. All I do is sit around my house, wasting electricity, entertaining myself online as I try to drown out the thoughts that I should just end it all.

"I just figured out a big reason as to why I'm so messed up mentally and I'm have g a mental breakdown over itSo, I figured out a huge reason as to why I'm so messed up in the head. I was on a little movie marathon. I had watched a great music movie called ""That Thing You Do!"", and then I went to Netflix to watch two more movies. These last two movies were what made me realize this big reason for my depression. I first watched a movie I loved as a child, that movie being ""Monster House"", and then I watched ""Coraline"" for the first time. I know, an odd choice of movies to have a mental breakdown over. Well, both movies involve young, pre-teen protagonists. They all go on their own little adventures, and all that dumb stuff. Your average movie for kids and teens. They're both amazing movies, by the by. But, after I watched them, I went to use the restroom, and once I had finished, I sort of stared in the mirror for a while, thinking and reflecting about both the movies and my life. And, after a while, I realized that I never had the chance to be a kid. I never had the chance to live out a normal childhood. I've always been impoverished, not horribly, but enough to almost always be on the edge of financial crisis. My parents have always been divorced, and my father and some other family members are horrible people. My mom sheltered the hell out of me, so I never gained social skills or friends. I had a verbally and physically abusive stepfather for years during my childhood. And the list goes on and on. And, come to think of it, it helps me put everything into perspective. How I get upset over anime, and kids films, and cartoons. Stuff of that sort. It also explains why I can be so immature. I'm sixteen, I've never had a childhood, and because of that, I'm deathly afraid of growing up. It all makes sense. It all makes goddamn sense and I hate that it does. I'm breaking down over it. I'm crying and shaking like a madman. I am NEVER able to goddamn cry, not even at goddamm funerals, and here I am, crying and shaking like some baby. I want to kill myself. The first nearly two decades of my life were wasted. I wish I just had a normal childhood. I don't want to be a goddsmn mental case. I want friends. I want social skills. I want to be able to think back to fond childhood memories and say ""Heh, those were the times"". Instead, all of it is goddamn foggy because my brain blocked it out or something. I can hardly think back to Middle school. I can't handle this sudden realization. I just can't. Its past 3 am and I'm a goddamn wreck. My life will never be normal or happy, will it? I'll jaut always be a man-child that never got to be a kid. I hate my life. I hate everything.",1

My BDD has given me social anxiety so bad that I have a hard time even going outside, and keeping a job is pretty much impossible. I've tried and failed every time. Been in therapy for years trying to cope, tried every medication in existance, and I'm still back here.

"Friends, Family, Love interest and Me.Hey, I'm 19 years old. 

I find it hard to express myself to other but here I go I guess.

Let's start off with something nice. I was homeless (real nice right) till just recently I got a place, It's a studio apartment so it gets pretty lonely, but still I'm happy happy with that I suppose.

A lot of everything has been happening recently, My family has been struggling and friends and love interest have been kinda pushing me away...

Let's start with my friends. A lot of the time I spend my time talking to and playing games with my friends, but a lot of that time is usually spend making shitty terrible gut punching jokes about one and other. I hate making them about my friends but when they throw a brick at me and I suppose to let it hit me in the head? I want to stop this stupid nonsensical bullshit ""jokes"" and just make jokes and be happy with them but... I try to address it and it just gets shot down and beaten to the ground by ""You're so sensitive"" or ""You're fucking gay"" (Because that's apparently bad? Not at all of course.....)

Next is my family... Where to begin? Well first of all my mother has a tumor growing. She was so scared and still is... I try my best to help her through this hard time but she just keeps making it worse for herself. (I have two brothers) Now my older brother is a drunk who does drugs and cries and tells me how much of a bad brother he is (He isn't) and my other brother is actually doing kinda ok so I suppose that's a silver lining I guess.. My father was always controlling... He and my mom separated... And he harasses her with texts and also sent me a text (Not typing it all) basically asking me to come fight him (He is old and he acts like a teen... It upsets me so much)

Now there is a woman I truly love with all my heart... But I've fucked up so god damm hard I do not have a chance of getting my one true love back... (I did not cheat or anything I just let her go and was an idiot)

And lastly me. Now Everyone is their own worse critic, I know that but.... I'm a failure truly... I never passed grade 9, and I don't have a job and can barely get past some weeks... Some times, In fact most times, I just sit and think how I am still alive with how much I hate myself... Every night I feel depressed and want to just end it and I brokedown almost every day now.... Even now I'm sitting here typing close to ending my life... Would it be worth it? I don't wanna hurt anyone and be an even bigger burden then I already am... I just want to be at peace...",1
"I don't know anymoreI'm so lost and I don't know what to do, I feel like everyone around me hates me and I just can't cope.

"This world isn't right for meLots of people brush life off and tough it out. I can't do it. School is unbearable. The anxiety, the arbitrary and time-wasting work, even more work once I get home to ~~relax~~, an anxious couple hours laying in my bad thinking about how shitty life is, and waking up tired to do it all over again. How the fuck anyone gets through this is beyond me.

This is needless suffering. I don't believe anyone saying it gets better. I've been waiting for 5 years and the day hasn't come, and I can't wait any more. I get no enjoyment from living or being with people, and I'm harassed daily by family who can't do anything to help. Counselors and psychiatrists haven't done anything either. I don't care about the pain I would bring to others by ending my life; they deserve it.",1

"I will get sick and vomit. Many suicidal thoughts for 5 years but haven't pulled throughI have lied to my therapist and everyone around me for years. I still want to kill myself.

I have tried 3 different therapists, I refuse any big pharma happy pills and psychoactive legal drugs (aka medication), I'll throw it in the garbage before anyone gives me any, and to be honest don't think i need any but I still want to kill myself.

Every winter. I want to die. The norovirus will infect me and make me vomit, it is my biggest fear. Every fall i want to kill myself. I hate college, i hate the people around me. I want so desperately to just scream the most offensive shit at them at the top of my lungs but never have. I dont feel anything. In the summer im afraid of the flies, because the flies are going to infect me and give me vomit disease. I dont want to vomit.  I obsessively read people's stories about vomiting and want to strangle and torture THEM for it for some reason. Then i have a panic attack about vomiting. And then i have another panic attack about thinking evil violent thoughts. I think ""i must kill myself to prevent me doing something evil. I dont want to be some evil piece of shit who does crime or drugs or hurts people""

I hate the spring because finals are coming up.
I wash my hands so much that they wont stop bleeding.

I pretend the therapy works. But people are realizing my charade . I tried headspace and meditation and mindfulness but it doesnt help me at all unless im doing it every second of the day. 

I want to end it FOR REAL. I'm sick of thinking about it. Ive thought about it for 5 years now. I cant do it anymore. I will get sick and vomit before I die if i do not die now. I must rid the world of me before i become evil. 5 years of therapy. It DOESNT WORK. Not for me. I am going to do something to push it over the edge. I am going to start scaring all my friends away. Then, i am going to stop sleeping. Every night i am going to blindfold myself and listen to sounds of vomit and music that scares me. I tried it last night and it fucking destroyed me. I need to keep doing it. It works. Free yourself. Fuck. Why am i even typing this. Go aaywa",1
"I am my own worst enemy.I've read a lot of posts here from people saying that they feel like failures and overall, suffer general sadness.  I can't imagine what it's like to have such strong unavoidable feelings and not know why - My heart aches for you all and I really hope that you are able to work through it.  Despite my own desire to jump off a cliff, I do believe that it gets better when you're able to figure out the root of the issue. I have the opposite problem.  I know exactly what's wrong with me, but lack the skills required to fix it. 

I am an (generally) upbeat, outgoing, talented girl in her late 20s.  I have a beautiful home, a smart, funny, handsome, supportive boyfriend, and a good job.  Over the last little while, I've become a shell of the person I'm capable of being and it's because I've finally realized why my life is so messy. 

I have become aware that I am never going to achieve the things I want to in life because I lack the self discipline and organization to do so.  I was happy before - becoming aware of this is what sent me on my downward spiral so please don't tell me that these things are caused by depression. I used to just lalala my way through life and since I'm a talker, I could get myself pretty much whatever I wanted.  Then I get bored, my other traits kick in, and it all falls to pieces.  To put things into perspective:

- I'm constantly forgetting things.  I make plans and then double book, I misplace important things (keys, cell phone, purse, etc.),  I pay bills late when I have the money.  I have tried so many different ways to keep myself organized but none of it has ever been successful.  

- I'm late ALL the time. This has cost me many jobs and makes employers incredibly annoyed. It's never ""oh, I slept in.""  It's more that I don't understand the concept of time and find myself rushing around like a maniac when I realize I'm unable to get them done in the time I've given myself.  I'm never very late, but 5-10 minutes a few times a week can definitely cost you a job. In turn, I repeatedly tell myself what an idiot I am for not being able to get somewhere FIVE minutes early and save myself the embarrassment.    It also upsets friends and family.  

- I am incapable of doing something long term if I don't enjoy it.  I'm envious of the type of people that can say ""My job isn't great but it's not my life.  I do this to allow myself time and money to pursue the things I enjoy."" I can't.  I've tried, I'm trying currently and again, it's not working out.  I'm miserable.

- I am easily distracted.  I can't focus on things for an extend period of time unless I'm 100% enjoying it.  I have one particular hobby that I could usually do for hours (which shows me I'm capable, which actually makes me feel worse), aside from that I am constantly distracted and unable to focus on things I don't find interesting.  I don't drive because I fear that I'll hurt someone by becoming distracted. 

The combination of these things has resulted in my inability to follow through with anything in my entire life.  I have only had one job for more than a year - I dropped out of high school, driver's ed, and college - I have NO credit (I had poor credit for a while, but I adopted a mentality that if I don't have money for it in the bank, I can't afford it) - I don't drive so I rely on others.  In fact, I am CONSTANTLY relying on the kindness of others.  It's not fair to anyone, I feel like I'm taking advantage of them and that's not the kind of person I want to be. 

Currently, I know that I hate my job and I should get a new one because it's making me miserable, but what's the point? I'll just fuck up the next one.  I thought about going back to school but why bother?  I'm just going to end up with a fuckton of debt and no degree because I won't finish.  I want to pursue my hobby but I don't have the organization to make a career out of it and it's not something you can go to school for.  I also don't have the discipline to muscle through the ""unfun"" parts in order to achieve my goals. 

I constantly fail, therefore I am a failure.  Coming to terms with who I really am and realizing that these things aren't going to go away is what has left me paralyzed with sadness and I hate myself for being this kind person. If I know I can't fix it, what's the point of even living?  ",1

It would be easier to get Corona, because my lungs are so fucked up, I'd probably die weeks later. My immunity is so fucked up that I'll probably get it almost immediately too. And I still have bad cough so maybe the tests were wrong and I have it - I got tested as a precaution because of work.

"I can't keep tryingSo for the better part of the last 3 years I've suffered heavily with depression and anxiety, as well as generally wanting to not be around. The reason for this is quite deep but let's just say that I had a relatively shit childhood, and I had my heart broke.

It's gotten to the point where I no longer want to be live. I don't envision a future anymore. I just want to die but if I'm honest I don't have the balls to do it. I have 3 sisters and leaving them would be so hard.

But it seems like everyday things get worse, and I progressively get closer to just saying fuck it and giving up. I constantly get told to keep going, take each day one at a time, just to get through the day. But it's seem as if with each passing day the more I can't take it.

If I'm honest idk even know why I'm posting this. If I'm honest I'm quite alone atm. Most of my friends arent really bothered with me anymore. I rarely hear off or see any of them.

I just want my body to turn off, to join my spirit. It would be better if they disappeared together. 

Why did you leave me? I'm alone. You were my last hope of redemption. You were the last person I would smile at. I needed a friend.

Why did you leave me?

Why did you leave me?

Why am I so alone? Where are all the people who used to be in my life? Where are all the people I loved? Where are all the people without whom I could not live? Where are the too many guests at my birthday party? 

I have too many fingers to count those who remain. I don't think there are any left.

The student loneliness that we talk about so much only starts when the classes stop.

WHERE ARE MY FRIENDS!!! 

How did I get here?

I have no hope left. I have no future. I don't have any feelings anymore. I am no longer happy, sad, in love, angry, passionate, anxious, overexcited. Everything is gone.

I need to get better. I need to get better. I need to get better. I'm really going to die. My body can't take the pain in my head any longer. I'm really going to die. There's nothing else left. It's only a matter of days, my heart will stop beating on its own. I don't know when I last lived. I don't know when I last felt happiness. I don't know when I last felt an emotion. I would like to be drunk to forget everything. I would like to drown myself in alcohol so I don't remember that I don't feel anything.

No one can help me. It's too late, it was in December that I needed help. Now it's too late, I'm about to die. 

Why am I alone?

I remember when Ewen had his breakdown, and we were there for him. We talked about it in the class council, we made him go to the theatre with us, we invited him to parties, we checked on him at boarding school.

But today, everyone has had their fill of misfortune. We can't be there to support the others anymore, we don't have the shoulders. I just wish I still had one friend. To have just one hug. And cry. I would like to cry. Sometimes I read something or hear music, and I want to cry, but I can't. If there is a god somewhere, I beg him to stop my agony. Whatever the way. Please. Please.",0

"I overdosed on Wellbutrin as a way to escape, now my mom is punishing me.. (kind of a vent)So this happened about 2 days after school started on August 10th, and I have been having issues. The teachers and students in the school are very nice, but what they teach is kind of patronizing me. It is a religious school, and to me what they are saying is that girls do nothing but seduce men, and so you can't wear certain clothes like tights, skirts/shorts above knee, etc.. and if you do you are basically wanting attention. We aren't even allowed to wear jean pants on Friday's, only jean skirts. And if the skirt is long enough but the slit goes above your knee, you get dress coded and fined $10. There are also other ridiculous rules like if you don't go to church weekly you get kicked out... there are so many I won't type it here because I want to keep things short. Anyway,  I might sound like I am complaining, but I have been to religious schools my entire life, and none of those have been this patronizing. I even told my mom and other family members how crazy these rules are, and they aren't on my side.. If this school didn't cost 6K I would leave, but I can't since I have a scholarship and my mom would have to pay 6K if I get kicked out. Plus, the only other school near my house is a big school in a not so good area, and I don't do well in large crowds b/c of social anxiety and something else. So I have no choice but to stay... All the religious pressure and ridiculous rules caused me to break.. so I decided I wouldn't go to school the next day. I didn't want to tell my mom because she would say no since it is the first week of school. So I took matters into my own hands. I didn't want to go back, I was done. I was so depressed for years, I attempted suicide in the past but i didnt have the guts to do it. I took my prescription bottle of wellbutrin and i took a handful of pills, I went to the bathroom and started taking them. I stopped at about halfway through because I scared to die, so I hid the rest under my pillow. Then I decided to go to bed, but I changed my mind and went to my moms room. When i was at the door of her room I started to hallucinate and see black blobs moving around, and i started hyperventilating and my mom was worried. She saw that my pupils were dialated so i just told her i was tired. She walks me to my room, and right when Im near my bed, I fall and have my first seizure. All i remember is waking up on the ground and paramedics were over me, and then a few moments later i have another seizure in the ambulance. I was in the hospital from Wednesday night to Saturday Morning, and I had to go to a mental hospital for around the next 3 days. I wanted to die every day. But i felt even worse seeing my mom upset. I was only allowed to call her in the mental hospital, so I couldn't see her and I just felt sad. We also had a family session, where a therapist and I were be in the same room, and my mom was on the phone. She said she cleaned out my room, went through EVERYTHING, and I became mortified. I had a box that said please do not open, which she opened, and saw all my medications i didnt take. I also had a folder where i wrote letters about what was going on, stuff i didnt want her to see. She found and read all of those, and also revealed the secrets to the therapist in the room, which made me really embarrassed and quite mad. Then, out of nowhere, she decides to ground me, by taking all of my electronics. I became upset because to me she really had no reason to do that. She never once mentioned that until after she saw my secrets. I am a technology person, so i usually like to do coding, and i had gotten a laptop for school, and bought other electronics for school as well. She took all of those, even my old DSI. She also said she would go through them. I wasnt really upset about that because I had recently reset those devices. I cant even at least text my friends, who are worried about me. Yes, I still havent gotten my electronics back to this day, so i am typing this on my moms computer.  She wont tell me why she took them away.. and she seems not nice like she normally is. I get that what happened has scared her, and it is my fault, but do i really deserve to get grounded after i come out the hospital? i would try to ask her why she is grounding me, but she just doesn't answer. I really want to know. I wont ask anymore because she still seems upset. I have to end this here, and if there are any questions i will reply as quickly as i can. I may have left stuff out.",1

According to @jairbolsonaro we can already consider the people suicidal.,0
"Started writing goodbye lettersI don't know where I stand on the idea of killing myself. I've been journaling a lot recently and wrote a few pages today, which turned into me talking about suicide and eventually, a few good bye notes. I got halfway through the third when I stopped. 

I've considered suicide a few times in the last few weeks. Too much has been lost and I can't help but feel like I'm running out of time to get myself back on track. 

Anyhow, as coherent as the writing and words were, I didn't cry about it. In fact despite a somewhat persistent need to cry today, I've only shed a few tears. I thought really contemplating this would have taken more out of me, but it didn't. 

I don't know if I've changed my mind; I just know that I'm getting too desperate not to keep it in mind. 

I turned our wedding guest book...a diary of our marriage, into a series of suicide notes and an accounting of all the misery my wife's infidelity planted inside of me. So many have told me she's not worth the anguish--that I should just get a divorce. And I know she doesn't love me. Probably never did. Don't think she ever had an honest bone in her body when it came to committing to our relationship, let alone our marriage. And I was a fool. I saw and felt things. I had so many suspicions but I always made excuses. I thought I was being paranoid and not trying hard enough to be patient and trusting of my wife. And for 6 months I suffered. I suffered at home and I suffered at work. I left that job after two years because I was bringing that misery home into our life, and our happiness was more important to me. Only recently have I realized that the trouble I had at work was me bringing the misery from our marriage into the office. One source of depression fed into the other until they were indistinguishable. I chose her over comfort and income, but she couldn't even choose me once, over anything. I would have given anything for that woman but now there's nothing left to take from me; and I have nothing left to give. 

I don't know what I'll decide to do, but I have the time and opportunity to make the choice. For myself.",1
"I'm no longer suicidal....and I don't think I ever was. You see, I think what drove me to considering suicide was the erroneous belief that somehow my death means something to someone. It doesn't. Or at least to the people that I want it to mean something to. Nowadays I don't really care about others or what they think of me being dead. Honestly, the reason I wanted to kill myself was because I was depressed that I had no friends coupled with the fact that I wanted someone to care that I was gone. But as you can see, those two things contradict each other. If I don't have people that like me, there is no one who is gonna care if I'm gone. And if I'm gone, there is a 100% chance that things won't get better. But you know what? Screw that. I don't need friends. I think it's pretty self demeaning to compare your self worth to how many other people like you. If I end up getting friends, a girlfriend, or whatever, then great. If not, so be it. I don't really care that much anymore. Something is better than nothing. A life is better than no life. At least I can FEEL something. Even if it is non stop pain and misery. It's what keeps me going.",1

"Crippling loneliness and being unlovableThat's me. None of my friends at college would miss me if I killed myself. They've all got eachother. Meanwhile I have to sit next to an annoying shit. 

My mum wouldn't miss me. I cause her more pain than happiness. I'm rude when I'm stressed and I'm stressed all the time. She hit me yesterday.

My cousins, aunts and uncles would not miss me, I'm pretty sure.

My ex used my kindness for her own gain. I doubt she ever loved me. I have no lovable qualities. 

I pushed away my friends who aren't at my college. When I was going through a hard time a while back I relied on them and only spoke about my problems. They hate me now, I'm pretty sure. I could try to reconnect but I don't want to bother them. 

The only people who would miss me are my dad and brother. They mean the world to me, but things are starting to really get on top of me and I don't feel like I'll be able to change any of it.",1

I'm so exhausted and angry from struggling to get ahead. I'm isolated yet surrounded. I'm consumed with hate for myself and the world around me but at the same time I love the world and humanity so much. I want to talk to someone. I want someone to tell me I'll get through this but I don't want someone to lie to me. I feel like peeling the god damn skin off of my face and riping off my fingernails. Pleas help me.

"Is anyones life as fucked as as mine? Well here I go, my life is fucked up, I'm way beyond help and it seems the only option is suicide. Here's the thing, I have severe anxiety, I mean severe, I can't leave my house, I can't talk to anyone, I can't even talk to my family. My whole world is in my bedroom, I have literally no friends, I have no education (high school dropout), I more than likely have cancer (huge lymph node swelling), I've put on a lot of weight and now have stretch marks all over my body (this is honestly the worst part, I don't even care about the cancer. These stretch marks are fucking awful, they're so repulsive I can't even look at myself fin the mirror anymore). I live in a country as a temporary resident which means even if I wanted to get cancer treatment I couldn't. I'd need to move back home which is impossible for me. I'm too scared to look at my bank account as I know I'm in debt (not much, it's the monthly fee's that are adding up and I have no income). 

My life is pure hell. I don't know why I'm writing this as I can't get help. I could never go to the doctors, that's far too terrifying. I'm currently 20 years old, male, I feel so ashamed.

"i'm all out of hopesorry if this doesn't make much sense.  i'm sort of in the middle of a breakdown and i don't know what i'm going to do.

i'm depressed, like really depressed.  it comes and goes but it's been a steady downward path.  before i got depressed i was a promising student at a world famous university, now i'm no longer in school, unemployed (keep getting rejected) living with roommates at least one of whom hates me. i am running out of money and relying on my parents even though i'm an adult and i dont have a whole lot of food in my apt right now but i can't bring myself to do all the work of showering, putting on clean clothes, bundling up and walking to the store, shopping, carrying it all home, putting everything away, cooking something and then cleaning up directly afterwards (or else my roommate will get mad at me).  i dont have the money to keep ordering out.  it's also very cold in my apt, and i think that's really starting to drive me crazy.  i'm also struggling with my gender and sexuality and i really really hate it.  i hate being queer. that's not the only reason i'm depressed but its constantly getting worse and its just one more thing i don't need to be dealing with right now.

i'm trying. i've been trying.  i'm now on ssri #3 and at this point the only noticable effect is a shitton of memory loss.  i go to therapy. i've quit drinking.  i'm even on meds for hypothyroid and i had some hope they might help my mood as well.  but right now, looking back, it seems things are only steadily getting worse.

the bottom line, SW, is that i cannot live the rest of my life like this.  every day, i lose hope that it's going to go away because it seems to me like i'm doing everything i can.  when things first got bad it was somewhat easy for me to tell myself it wasnt going to last forever, but it's been years, guys, years, and it's only gotten worse and i'm no longer seeing the point.  i lived the best years of my life up to about age 18 and since then i might as well be dead.  i wanted to be this amazing fucking scientist, but now that doesn't even seem worth it.  even if i do somehow crawl out of this pit and become successful, i don't even care if i still have to feel like this.  i thought maybe there was something wrong with me and all my doctors would figure it out eventually but now i'm starting to think maybe i just cant handle being an adult and i'm doomed to either live like this for the rest of my life or take the chance that there's something better on the other side.

i dont know. i'm scared.  i dont want to die, but i'm getting to the point where i refuse to live this way much longer.  i can't do it and i wont.  can someone just... give me some hope that the rest of my life isnt going to be this way?  it's been so long and i'm out of hope. do you all have any you could spare?",1

"Am I a lost cause ?Hi everyone,
Sorry in advance for my English.

I'm writing here today because I need to talk and here is why.
I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety 4 years ago and I was in depression for around 2 years. It was awful. I wanted to die , life was disgusting and I had no interest for anything around me. I started to feel better after taking a lot of meds, seeing a psychiatrist and all that stuff.

Once everything was behind me, I started to feel better. I found a way to progress in my life. I finally got accepted at the university and everything just got better. 

Until these last 6 month, I think everything is coming back at me and no matter what. I don't sleep , I don't eat , I hate my life. To be more precise, I hate life. And now I just don't know what to do. I don't want to get down that path again but what is the point to see a doctor again if everything will just turn it to be the same again and again? What is the point to try to fit in this life and beeing happy while I just can't ? 

Some day I feel okay and some I just picture myself throwing myself off a bridge. I am lost here. I see myself as a lost cause who will be unhappy forever. In the bottom of my heart I do want to be happy but I just can't... My head just won't let me. 

I just don't know what to do anymore. Living is unbearable and dying is not an option either but I know that each day just make this option more appealing.

Sorry for the long story but I needed to talk and here it is.

Thanks",1

I can't do this any longer. I'm a 16 year old male. I was diagnosed with severe depression when i was eleven. Ive been cutting on my legs and arms for years and i've just lost sight of a valid reason to continue my already pathetic existence. My mother has Breast cancer and has been in the hospital for months due to complications and the doctors are saying she hasn't much time. I plan to end my life shortly after the cancer beats her because the thought of life with my abusive alcoholic father isn't bearable. No one will miss me. I don't have any family other than my dad and the kids at school don't notice me so there isn't anyone my acts will truly affect as my mother will be dead before  I cary out my plan.

"Please help.My first girlfriend left me 7 months ago and I'm still very sad about it. Therapy isn't helping. I just started back on anti depressants and I feel absolutely terrible. I'm very depressed most of the time, and I think about suicide a lot. I need help.",1

"I feel like there’s not much left.I know I’m in acute crisis mode. I’ve been in therapy and on meds for years. But tonight feels insurmountable. 


Today, I turned 30 years old. It’s the first birthday I’ve looked forward to since my 21st. And both were absolute disasters. 

Today, I started miscarrying my child. I have to have a d&amp;c on Thursday and I’m scared out of my mind.  My husband and I have been struggling with secondary infertility for over 18 months. I’m heartbroken and so so so scared. 


Years and years and years ago I had an affair. My husband found out and forgave me and we worked through it for a long time. We’ve been in such a good place for so long. Since before our first kid was born (3.5 years ago). Recently old fling reached out to me for advice with his new girlfriend. Husband found out today. And I feel like shit. I’m the worst wife ever imagined. I can’t even imagine the pain I’ve caused my husband the second time around.  


I spent so long tonight hugging and kissing my so goodbye because I’m not sure I can live through the pain of miscarriage and hurting my husband and the trauma of my birthday (a whole nother story). I just feel like leaving tonight would be best. I said goodbye to my son. I hugged him and kissed him a million times. I know I’d use the garage and CO poison. I’ve been planning it for years. I just feel like it’s time. I can’t go through the d&amp;c on Thursday. I’m so scared. I can’t stop reliving the trauma of my “super special” party at the concert. I can’t forgive myself for hurting my husband again. 


My son is the only reason to stay. But he’d be so much happier with just his daddy around. I’m lost and so sad and so hurt and so confused. I’m going to give myself a little while to calm down. Wish me luck.",1
"I'm struggling.I imagine sitting in the garage and letting my car run while I take a nap. I've heard the fumes are a good way to go.
 
I don't want people to miss me or blame themselves. I wrote a note tonight. I feel bad because I stuck it in my Bible. God is my only solid foundation.
 
I feel like a kid not getting what he wants. I know there is still a chance. I have to keep faith. So maybe this is a test. Maybe I won't do anything about it right now. What about tomorrow though?
 
I will army crawl through piles of wasps for the ones I love. If it's just me though... I don't think maybe I have enough interest. I guess I'm just not that into me.",1
"Abusive Relationship is killing me. Please help.Hi.

Im a male in my twenties. For a really long time I have been quiet about this, but I cant just stand it anymore. the pain is too big. I have been suffering emotional and physical abuse from my mother all my life.

Its unbearable. The constant humiliation. The guilt-tripping, the lies and the manipulation. The feeling of whortlesness. Its eating at the core of my being. And snatching away my dignity.

My parents separated when I little, which left my mother as a pile of alcoholic mess. where she would DUI and spank us violently. then she would lie to all of the family saying nothing happened, and they all turned a blind eye.

Nowadays she doesnt drink as much, but her violent episodes are still there. Where she tries to phisically assault me, then goes to the relatives or the police accusing me of beating on her.

The worse of it all, is that in the eyes of everyone, Im always at fault. Because Im a ""bad son"" or a bad person that doesnt do what my poor frail mother asks. All the guilt for her behavior, has always been directed at me. The feeling of helplesness and the crushing loneliness is just too much.

I cant take this anymore. Shes destroying my life and Im miserable. You guys will certainly say that I should just man up and move out of the house because Im an adult. But How? I have not nearly enough money to live by myself and pay for college. Theres just no way to do it working haltime where im from. I see no way out.

I am grateful for all shes done for me really, for paying for my stuff. but I guess this isnt an excuse to making me feel like shit.

The depression has been affecting my academic performance, I have been bailing classes like crazy. Thats what everyone doesnt get. I just can bring myself to do anything for I dont have the willpower. How can I have the strenght to study and to sustain myself If Im too depressed to do so.

I feel that I have been carrying all my life the weight and guilt of her frustrations. Its just too much of a burden.

Last week after another violent episode, where she flipped because I had the audacity to stand up to her trying to humiliate me. Im just left as a mess. I cant do anything. No relative will help me. My father from his comfortable position from very far away thinks I beat up my own mother and my family thinks Im some kind of villain.

Im posting this here bacause the thought of suicide has appearing on my mind at an alarming rate. At this rate, I think the pain will be just too much for me to cope with. These feelings of desperation, loneliness and shame are eating my soul. I need help.

I wanted to live a good life. I wanted a girfriend, I wanted a loving family, I wanted professional success. I dont have that big of a dream, I just wanted to be normal and happy. Thats all I ever wished for, but I just dont see myself with any of those.

I just wanna live.

**edit:** Im feeling a little better now. My mother is giving me the silent treatment, which is good because atleast we arent fighting. Thank you all for listening, I didn't expect to receive such an understanding response. Im a mess, but I'll try my best.
You guys are saving lives here, never forget that.

**edit2:** She just said to me that she wont question anything I do and if I should cancel my college I should do it. All conviniently ignoring the matter about the abuse and all that shit that has been going on. You could cut the arrogance with a knife. I just didnt have the strength to say anything, I just cant fight anymore.",1
"Barely Hanging OnToday I did a stupid thing. For some backstory- my ex gf (first love) broke up with me 2 years ago. It wasn't on a bad note or anything but we don't talk anymore. She was the first best friend I've ever had. During the relationship I was always extremely jealous. I suspected her of cheating but never told her until afterwards and she of course reacted badly. But she admitted she left me for someone else. Stupid me back then took her back a couple months later and she broke up with me again. Today out of curiosity I go snooping around on her social media. Turns out she's dating the person I suspected her of cheating on me with. Perfect. 


When we were dating they would always be alone together and there was just something weird about them. I stuck with her because I had no one else. After we broke up I had another relationship. That person left me for someone else too and though she didn't cheat on me- she actually fucking told me that she had sex with someone else the day she broke up with me. On Valentines day. 


Anyways when I went snooping around today my heart really genuinely started to hurt. It hurt as much as when she broke up with me- though this time I didn't cry. I was just devastated. I'm currently in school. I went out of state to avoid certain people but now I'm left with almost no friends. The friends I do have I'm not that close with. I have no best friend. I haven't had a female friend in over a year and it makes me feel worthless. I try talking to people but its all just small talk. No one actually wants to remain friends with me. I've gotten so desperate I nonstop check my school's ""crush"" page to see if anyone maybe thinks something nice of me but is too shy to say anything. Nothing ever gets posted about me. I got a new phone a couple months ago and only about a week ago did I add my first contact into it. 


Because of everything in my life I formed a toxic addiction- one I won't go into great detail about because I'm extremely ashamed about it. But I'm suffering. Every day. I realize that I don't want to actually die. That's not what being suicidal is to me. I just want to live a better life. But I'm losing hope now that the better life will happen. When I'm out and about I always smile as much as possible and pretend to be a normal and healthy person. Maybe people see through my fakeness- maybe no matter how hard I try I'm still just plain unlikable. I don't even know what I'm saying anymore. Im just losing hope. And I fear that when I lose hope I'll lose my life. ",1

"What the hell am I even doing here?Ok, because I know that I am going to write a freaking novel here, there is a TL;DR for trolls to read so that you won't spam to me that I shouldn't tell that much etc. bla bla idc

TL;DR: Shitty Childhood, Shitty Teenage Years, Shitty Parents, Helper for friends, gets me even more depresed, I just want to stop the pain, Just graduated from high-school with no plans for the future, no real-gf ever, introverted af in rl, extroverted in the internet, kinda like to personalitys, anxious agains women (got my reasons)

So, for everyone that ones to deal with my shit or not, here I come. To start off simply I got like the generic bullcrap Childhood as way to many kids these days, my parents were unable to cope with a kid and I was treated like an object. I wasn't really taken care of by them but mostly just given crap I wanted but nothing really personal happend between me and my parents.

In Kindergarden I was the person I am now in the internet, kinda. I was extroverted had many friends and people just generally liked me and I had alot of friends, but one kid, didn't like that and started to verbarly and later even physicaly harasse me. That harassement was a chalk brick into my face and some trys to poison me with certain lunatic ideas. It was later found out that he was psychologically damaged and picked me as a target, but the damage has allready been done, I was more insecure of myself and became more and more an introverted kid, that ofc lead to my parents and my real-life friends to not like me anymore, because I was a different person.

Later in secondary school with only new people I was hated by everyone instandly, It was hard to imposible to find new friends and those 2 I had from primary school instandly turned against me for some ""cooler kids"". So I was now hated by the majority of my class mates and the harrasement didn't stop there, I won't go into much detail because I just don't want to/can't. And my parents ultimatly wanted me to ""grow up"" and to protect myself agains bullies, so what did they do? They threw me on the ground hold my arms and screamed to me to free myself. I therefor not only started to hate everyone in school but then my parents. But then a random girl from my class approached me and asked me if we could be friends together, I didn't hesitated and we became good friends very quickly, she then asked me if we could date each other and It seems like my hole world would just get better again, but I was to optimistic about that. 2 weeks after our ""relationship"" began, which wasn't even like ""friends with benifits"", it was just a generic friendship that was called a relationship, she told me that she wanted to date me because she felt sorry for me and that she and I should move on.

As other kids in thier late puberty were alot intrested into sexual relationships and to lose thier virginity as fast as they could I just didn't care. Same to this date, sure I still try to find my ""Significant Other"" but not for any sexual reasons but for romantic and emotional ones, that is the first time I encountered my demisexuality, which made and still makes matters worse.

I woulnd't certainly be here anymore if it weren't for my best friend that I found randomly over the internet, we get along each other since 2011 and we are very good friends until this day. He saved my live but he doesn't know this because I haven't really spoken about my ""past"" with him, because that would most likely hurt our friendship. But for alot of people I meet I am like a psychiatrist because not only can I relate to other but I am a very good listener and know alot of the times if I should just listen and back up him/her or if I should activly help him/her. But this one the one hand helped me, because I also told them about my past but in most cases it just threw me back into a deep hole that I had to climb out once again. I had so many suicidal thoughts from the age of 15-17 but I never hurt myself because I knew it wasn't worth. I crazily enough made a ""backup"" plan, a safe and painless way to end it all, just in case. Because I am scared as hell to suffer though anykind of pain I could inflict myself, and would therefor just kill myself if it was w/o pain.

I had so many days where I lied in bed and cryed my soul out. Sometimes my parents would actualy see that and tell me to ""man up"", and to not make matters worse. But they do not know how much that actualy hurts in my heart.

This is just like on of these days, I wan't to just quit life, and just make matters easy, that why I am writing this. I know that no one with a healthy mind will read this all, and I can fully understand that. But the feeling that I finaly put some of the bs I lived through in this forum, and that someday, maybe some one might listen to me once, is something I never got so far.

And now I am sitting here, I gratuaded from high school, yey, but tomorrow is the horror fest of the hole graduation thing and everyone wants to party but I just want to get my stuff and leave. I have no idea what I should and can do in the future. I know that if I continue living like I do right now I will never find my ""true love"" and that actualy gets me really sad, because all arround me, everyone got a ""partner in crime"" but I am left out. I am just the ""nice guy"" living next to everyone, helping everyone out, getting used by everyone and that nobody really notice tho.

But I know that I will most likely live alone until I die, because I just can't get enough confidence Offline nor Online. I mostly tell my friends that I just don't care, and that if someone has intrest into me that they should initiate something, but in reality. I am just a scared little piece of shit. That doesn't deserve being loved or cared after. It's all my fault in the end anyway. I haven't done anything good yet, and I won't do in the future.

I actualy want to, as a self discpline, post a ""sign of live"" here, first reason, because just writing out my feelings actualy helps me a bit and secondly, if someone cares, which nobody will tbh, they have a way to find out that I am in a better place by then.

"I almost did it last night because when I woke up I thought I was still dreaming.I had just committed suicide in my dream and it woke me up, also I had to pee. When I woke up I was still really hazy and kinda of half in half out of dream state. Like the dream world was kind of meshing with my house. Which is very out of norm for me cause when I’m up, I’m up. As I come back from the bathroom I remember I forgot to take my medication before bed because I fell asleep watching videos. I go to take my meds and as I try to shimmy them out they just all pour out into my palm. This kinda triggers me back into the dream state cause it was the same as in my dream and I almost swallow the palm full. I haven’t had an attempt yet for about 5 seconds there I was there I was at that point and I felt it. Luckily I snapped myself back. But that feeling was terrifying. It’s even scarier cause it’s like I almost killed myself subconsciously or by accident. But I let my spouse know and I have an appointment on Monday and we have implemented safety measures in the mean time so I’m safe at the moment.",1

"I can't handle itSo I want to keep this as brief as possible. I have been depressed for the past 5 years and one of the worst things I am tired of dealing with are the constant nightmares, and by nightmares, these aren't your average just spooky nightmares, these are most of the time so violently graphic and often include myself dying in them. I have only attempted suicide once, and I was legitimately going to go through with it but I fell for a clever thing one of my best friends did, which was inviting me to her dorm to talk and when I arrived the University Police were waiting there with her. I don't think that I will fall for that next time I get to that point, but I don't know I constantly think irrationally because I can stay awake for a week at a time before I have to sleep for at least a short period, it is so painful. I also think about suicide at least 5-10 times a day on a good day but have rarely acted on them. Any advice would really help me right now as I feel like I am heading down that path again as I started self harming myself for the first time in years today.",1

"Offing myself seems to be the only “cure all” I can think of and I hate it - a rantI’ve been having terrible spirals lately and today’s is probably the worst yet 

 I once again push my significant other away and was very hurtful with my words. I sobbed to my mom. Wrote to my cousin that I wanted to get away at her house; this was all made more complicated because COVID is still a thing so I can’t actually just get away without having to quarantine after, etc etc etc. which is another big pain 

Amidst my breakdown, my mom asked “well what do you want?” Like do you think I know??? My partner made a very good point where he thinks I haven’t been trying hard enough to get help (he’s right). My sisters said “can you give us more info?” When I told them I was gonna run away for a bit because they’re worried about COVID and what would happen when I come back. 

I’m too scared of blades to hurt myself. I don’t want to look like a weirdo for lying in the snow for hours even tho i want to. I don’t want to completely off myself but that seems to be what my mind is revolving around 

I don’t even want to die I just want help and attention and for someone to fix me. But I don’t know what the fix is and because of that, death is the easy option. After my breakdown I was just lying here thinking “if this is going to be my life... I don’t want it” 

Anyways, rant over. I just have a headache and want someone to help me figure out what tf is wrong with me but no one knows, not even myself and I’m so tired",1

"I cant get this picture out of my headSo first of all I am not suicidal.
I have 2 great parents and 1 great brother and I just could never hurt them so I wont kill myself or anything. ( If they would not exist that would be a diffrent story but that is just hypothetical)
But since 2 years now I pretty much dont feel any enjoyment anymore in life. Sure I get a laugh here and there if I watch a good movie or sitcom and if I listen to a good song I feel good but out of live in general I dont, it is kinda hard to explain what I mean in english , since I dont speak english nativ.
But since those 2 years I just always think ""I want to die"".
I dont know if you guys know what I mean but sometimes you have this strange thing, that you can't get out of your head and that you always think about doesnt matter if you are driving in the bus or if you lay in bed or if you sit on the toilett.
And that is this thought for me ""I want to die"".
Often I picture myself putting a gun to my head and pulling the trigger, what is kinda strange since I come from Europe and I actually never had a gun in my hand.

And not need anyone.. whenever I had problems like I was sad or something she didn’t care one day she said to me “I need to live my life” just threw me away like that like I was nothing. And that’s what I feel like.. I feel like Nothing. I miss her a lot and feel disgusted yet I still mourn the loss of my best friend. I wish we would of never gotten together if I had known I’d lose her. In such a frivolous way. Like throwing away trash.",1

"Life Will Get Better- Don't Give Up Now!&amp;#x200B;

I really wish that I could reply to every post that a suicidal person makes here, but I simply can't. And it hurts for me to know that while I'm trying to help one suicidal person realize that things will get better, there are thousands (if not more) of other suicidal people who are planning to do the same thing soon. 

It may not seem like it now, but things will get better and there are brighter days ahead.... but you won't be able to see those days if you go through with it. 

Just last month, I was in the same suicidal mindset as you. I came on here and made a post about how I was going to kill myself soon and everything. And here I am a month later glad that I didn't do it and realizing that people DO care. I just couldn't see it at the time because I was blinded by the depression and the pain. 

When I wanted to kill myself, I was very selfish...... Not because I wanted to kill myself, but because I would blame other people for my misfortunes and misery. I was a VERY selfish person and I'm not trying to pick at anybody on this subreddit, but there are a lot of selfish suicidal people here too. I see the common pattern of pinning the blame on the world and how this world bullies and belittles people. The truth is that the world IS a cold place and it's full of evil people, but you've given them control once you allow them to fill your heart with bitterness. 

I've learned that in order to become happy, you have to give happiness to other people through acts of love and kindness. And you may wonder, ""Why should I give love to others when they give me hate?"" Because every time you do a good deed and give to others, you will feel better about yourself and about your life. You'll start to realize that the world is a cold place, but you're unique because you're an individual whose purpose is to make it a warmer place. Then you'll realize that you don't want to end your life, but now you want to give more good to the lives of others so that they will not want to end their lives either. 

Again, don't end your life. You can't see the future, but there are brighter days ahead of you. It doesn't seem like it because you're blinded by the pain and emptiness, but it's there. And if you need ANY advice, I'm always here for you... and so are plenty of other people in this world.

Now go out and smell the fresh air and do something that you enjoy doing.... maybe it's making music, or playing video games, or watching movies!",1

"Update: I'll be on medication soonThis is an update from [My Last post](http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/apdlk/how_can_a_person_live_with_no_money/).  Today I went in for a psych eval to see if medication would be helpful (working with my therapist).  I've been prescribed Lamictal and Vyvance.  The doctor didn't diagnose me with anything, merely acknowledged I have symptoms of Bipolar disorder and ADD.  This isn't surprising based on our discussion.  I don't really think I am bipolar (certainly depression), but I did describe a mild high stage I went through a few weeks ago where I was quite a bit more sexual (never engaged in sex with anyone- just spent a lot of time in chat rooms online), and spent a bit more at the store than what I wanted (I'd go to the grocery store to buy one or two things, but ended up buying stuff I had plenty of, such as peanut butter or bread... not a big deal since I like to keep those in stock).  I didn't tell her about my mild hallucination I've had a few times, where it's like I'm getting raped (I'm a gay guy, it's as if I'm being anally raped).  That's just too difficult for me to talk about.  It's incredibly embarrassing, and doesn't happen too often.  I'll start the Lamactil tonight, and the Vyvance sometime within the next few weeks (it'll take some time to get everything set up).  Both of these are provided to me for free (thankfully).  I've been hesitant about medication in the past, but right now am much more concerned about just trying something (especially with my possible ADD).  I'm incredibly tired of feeling stupid for reading things and not absorbing the material or feeling lazy because I keep putting off doing things.

Thanks to everyone for your help in my last post.  I'm still trying to figure out what I'll be doing, but hopefully my medication will help (especially the Vyvance).  In the meantime (while I'm getting adjusted to the medication), I still have no clue as to what I'll be doing, but this gives me a bit hope.",1
"I want to have a significant death (misleading title, sorry)I fantasize about suicide all the time, but I have absolutely no plans to pursue it soon. I don't ever want to grow old and become a useless human being, so I plan to kill myself somehow around the age of 50-55.\

That being said, I just want to reiterate that I am not immediately suicidal.

The thing that bothers me is that I don't know how I want to go. I'd like to go out with a bang, but I also want to have a creative factor involved. 

Does anybody else has similar aspirations/feelings?

"I can't do this anymore!Throwaway account. Always wanted to posted but was fearing judgement even from internet. I have fairly good life. Loving parents, good friends, graduating soon, and a good paying job right after graduation. Despite all that, there is sadness, and some kind of depression inside me, it has been there for sometime and every now and then it shows up. It started becoming a regular visitor when my GF for 2 years, whom I love more than anything and still do, broke up with me. I thought I had it under control and thought I could deal with it. I tried my best for last few weeks, succeeded too, at times. But it always comes back to haunt me and today was the worst. I cried for hours, thinking not only about what had been but also what would be if I left. Thinking about my parents and how crazy would it be for them always had kept me from going forward with it but I don't know if it can anymore. I went as far as writing a letter and really contemplating going forward and ending it all. ",1

"tired and consumed by suicidal thoughtsI am not sure how to start this, but I have opened up to a friend recently on having these thoughts. She has a lot going on, and I worry I am triggering her by confiding in her. She often doesn't respond, mostly because of her own issues and I guess I don't let it get in the way of me being there for her (and I try really hard to not project my feelings and issues onto her, and I try to put my difficult times away to be there for her). I genuinely feel like a good friend and I truly have a kind heart, so I don't want people to think I just constantly dump things onto people and like, get attention? I try to not talk to her about these things, but she just has always been that person who gets me on a different level. It's just really hard to be there for people when you are screaming out for some help of your own. And then I feel like garbage because I shouldn't have let her know these things when she has some difficult things going on. But I feel like she doesn't care? She knows I am pretty prideful and stubborn, and I wouldn't say something like that just to say it. I guess I just feel like no one takes my feelings seriously and I feel like I get ghosted by people all the time when I do open up, and it makes it really hard to feel validated as a person sometimes. 
I am so stressed out from work and school, so consumed by thoughts of just not being here anymore that interrupt my concentration on school, that I am having a hard time staying present. Joy is ripped from the things I love, and it's so hard to cope.  And it's just really hard when people just show they don't care, even if they don't realize they are hurting you. I don't know. I just don't know how to deal with them, and maybe I need reassurance that someone would care if it did happen. My friend shows me she wouldn't until it's too late...and any one else I have tried to gain the courage to tell usually just doesn't respond, or states something more like, be positive~ and mindful~. And it's hard. It's hard because I don't want to give these thoughts a voice but it's eating at me so much that I can't contain it. Suicidal thoughts aren't necessarily a decision to do anything or a real desire to do anything, but they are a start and I am terrified that there is just one step between me and it. I am devastated by images of my family mourning if I did this (I love them, they are my everything so I have a really hard time accepting that I could hurt them or even have thoughts of doing that), but the pain is so bad sometimes, and sometimes it feels it could outweigh theirs. I have chronic health issues and a long history of anxiety and depression, both related to physical health and just the balances in my head, and it just feels like my future is really bleak. I need help, but I don't know where to turn. I do not want to place all of this on friends or anything, but when you want to be shown some sense of...being? they are the ones you reach to when you are slipping sometimes. ",1

"I'm gonna kill myself tonightHi. I'm a 16 year old girl and i'm gonna kill myself tonight. 
I have aspergers syndome and borderline personality disorder. I'm very aggressive and when I get angry at my parents I assault them. I punch them and other dangerous things. I'm not normal. I can't control myself, and to be honest I don't know how my parents are still alive. I love them very much, but i'm sick and dangerous.
I'm the reason my parents are depressed and alcoholic. I'm the reason my dad doesn't wanna live anymore. If I died they would finally be free.
I hate my friends. They always tell me how ugly and annoying I am, (which is true, but still). I'm the outcast in my group of friends and I feel so alone. I hate them so much that sometimes I used to bring a knife to school so I could kill them if I wanted to. I would never be able to kill another human being, but that's how I felt at the time. I've always been the outcast, wherever I go. I really don't understand why. I dress like all the other girls and i'm pretty normal on the outside. I'm good at imitating normal people, so I don't understand why i'm always the weird one. I hate myself so much.

Some months ago, I actually started talking to a boy. He had been my crush for a very long time and I decided to actually talk to him. We started talking everyday and everynight. We had deep conversations in the middle of the night, and I started to fall in love with him. I had always thought i'd be single for the rest of my life, so this felt like a miracle to me. I know it may sound ridicolous, but I started to feel hope. I was so happy. But of course, three days ago he stopped responding. I feel so fucking miserable. I know it sounds like a very small problem, but when your life is already falling apart small things can destroy everything. 

I don't wanna live anymore. I'm sick and dangerous and my life is falling apart. I had so many dreams in my life. I wanted to move to Australia, become a criminologist, start a family. But fuck it. I'm an awful human being and I would do everyone a favor if I killed myself. So that's what i'm gonna do tonight. 

I don't know if what I just wrote makes any sense, but I just wanted to let my thoughts out. I wish you all a good life. God bless you. Goodbye.",1

He doesn't give me privacy, constant dirty jokes he laughs at and thinks I dont understand, when I'm just trying to steer the conversation, and the 'I'm gonna do/get/learn/build/buy etc'.

At least I tried, but evil people are everywhere. The most loving thing for me to do is to kill myself. Let's hope I won't fall for my foolish naivety and my delusional optimism again. It does not get better, but at least everything ends, if I find the courage to die. I will kill myself in a loving way and it will happen within next week.

"Need major help. Involves two suicidal girls where one is persuading the other ""to go"" at the same timeI really don't know if this is the right place to post this, but I seriously need some help. First off I want to say this doesn't involve me but a girl that I've been dating who I care about a lot (for simplicity let's call her Jane), and I really can't bear to see her get hurt! She told me yesterday about everything she's been going through with these two girls that she knows, and I was fucking speechless, normally I'm great at giving advice, especially when depression is involved, but fuck me I just couldn't.. 



Basically for like a few weeks this girl, let's call her betty, has been coming up to her and telling her how she's sick of life, how she has nothing to live for and just how suicidal she is, she'd go on to tell Jane about the different types of ways she wants to kill herself and goes on to say how she'll end up doing it this weekend and so on. I think the main cause is ket abuse, but she still does it. I want to say here that Jane and Betty know each other, but not even that well. Jane is pretty much that girl that warm, open, loving and people always think it's ok to confide in her.





So Jane has been dealing with this girl, talking to her, trying to get her out of it, but nothing seems to be working, Betty is past the point of caring for anyone and anything, even her dad who she loves more than anything.. It even got to the point where Betty, two days ago tried to kill herself by Over dosing on pills in Janes house, on her bed...
Betty will not go to a doctor because she knows there'll be a strong chance she'd be institutionalised or sectioned...




Now I'm gonna introduce girl number two, let's call her sophie, this girl suffers from depression, she's on antidepressents, but they're not working. Jane and Sophie are like best friends, and Jane didn't know until very recently how bad Sophie's depression has been, and how Sophie has been going through these suicidal thoughts as well. Now here comes the truly fucked up part. Betty has been talking to Sophie and trying to convince Sophie to commit suicide and to do it with her, and to leave this world together, I can't remember what the outcome of this was, and where Sophie stood with it, but I do remember Jane telling me that it would destroy her if Sophie committed suicide, like she would not be able to cope with that, and how fucking angry she was at Betty for doing what she's doing.
I think Betty and Jane are actively looking for a psychiatrist, for Betty.



Now Jane has gone to her university counsellor for advice and her advice to Jane was to simply leave Betty alone... Which actually shocked me incredibly.. 




What do you guys think Jane should do, I really want to help her but I really don't know what to say, what she's going through or what would be ""right"" in terms of what Jane should do. 
I do not know any of the two girls who are suicidal, I only know Jane. Knowing Jane, if anything happens to any of these two girls then she will 100% blame herself. 



Ofc I'm going to be there for Jane no matter what, and she's told me how just by being around me it cheers her up and she gets happier but at the same time I feel so useless with it all.. ",1
"Life is just a ride, no need to press the big red STOP button. Life is just a ride. It has a lot of ups, lots of downs. If you press the stop button (suicide), you won't be able to experience the rest of the ride. It will get better, it will also get worse at times, but it's just a ride. Ride the ride of life, until it naturally ends. Then you will truely get to experience both the greatness of your ride.

Basically, life is a ride that has some bad moments, but also has equally or even better good moments too. Don't stop, keep on going.

My doctor told me if I got worse I should go to the hospital. He send me also to some support groups but it will be months until they call me for an appointment.

"almost out of hopeI am having a really difficult time. my boyfriend of 3 years is seeing a married woman that he apparently has really loved for a long time. he was a youth pastor at the same church as this woman. I could never understand why he seldom would never invite me to go once we got closer. then he quit. over the weekend he invited some youth and their parents down to the lake for the day. one family...her family..including her husband...stayed for the weekend. my boyfriend barely looked at me or talked to me. this woman....treated her husband terribly and would rather spend time with my boyfriend than her husband. When I tried to introduce myself...she acted as if I was the ugliest garbage she had ever seen. When my boyfriend was trying to talk to me and flirt with me...to show me some affection...she walked over...opened up her towel to reveal a beautiful...gorgeous body...and said, ""in november..I always put on weight...then in the summer i lose it...then I just start the whole cycle over again.."" and she just walked away... I was so hurt....so upset...and my boyfriend just stood there..looking at her.  I tried to leave the next morning..after a day of being ignored and humilitated...my boyfriend was trembling and asked me to stay. I don't know why.

They are clearly in love with eachother. She lied to her husband. flirted with my boyfriend all weekend...and my bf treated her like a queen.   I just grew more and more angry. I thought leaving would give  my boyfriend what he wanted. I have suspected that he was interested in someone else....he has 3 children...she has ..I think 7? she is gorgeous. fun. flirty.  I am none of that. and Ive been struggling personally with depression and anxiety...forging a new career...I look terrible. I would understand why he would be attracted to her. but I think this has all been going on for a long time....and she is ready to leave her husband now. His children and hers are close....they all really care about eachother...it all fits. Her husband is a puppy...she is going to throw him away.

I really feel hopeless. Im 46...with out much to offer. I have never had therapy...but I need it. its just so expensive: i was sexually, emotionally , verbally abused my entire life until I finally got away from my family. I attempted suicide 3 times. the last time was in 1999. You can't heal that stuff on your own. You can only be a broken person. a guarded person that can't love. I can't love.

what am I  in this world if I can't love?

I don't think I'm going to make it. I think i've lived all of the life that I can....and I'm not whole....I'm useless, ugly and ignorant.

and so old.

my boyfriend says he loves me. that he wants and needs me....but how can you act the way he did...and actually mean that?

"In a McDonald's Parking Lot at 3AM and going to take a Late Night Swim on my Birthday.I swore to myself if I ever decided to kill myself I wouldn't write a suicide note or post on some forum, call some suicide hotline, etc, whatever.  But yet, here I am. Honestly I don't really care if anyone reads this or not. 

I guess the real reason I'm writing this is for Closure.. to say everything I feel inside on last time before I can finally be at peace.

Here I am 22yrs old, recently fired from work, alone on my birthday, Disowned by my family, betrayed by my friends, living in my car and my only source of entertainment is using the wifi at mcdonalds. Everything has gone from bad to worse. Why? Because of the Shit life I have been given since birth. Do you know what its like being born in the wrong body. Living every fucking day as someone your not just to please the people around you.  I've never felt like a boy, I've never fit in with the guys. After years of deep depression, cutting, self abuse and suicidal thoughts, and attempting it once before at the age of 13 by trying OD on pills. I finally worked up the courage to tell my parents I was Transgender. 

I figured it'd be a bit of a shock for them at first and it wouldnt' go smoothly at first but I wasn't prepared for what happened. Having them laugh at me and say it was just a phase and I a boy and will always be one and it'll pass and pretty much ignored it. But I persisted and continued seeing my therapist which they would never go see and sit down and talk to) I was excited to start HRT, however when my parents found out, they released I was serious about transitioning. Coming home from work one day, just to find all my shit packed and them telling me ""if I continue to transition, that I better just get the fuck out of their house because obviously I don't love them if I'm going to do something embarrassing like this to our family"". I left and they told me not to come back. I moved into a apartment and continued to transition. 

A month passed by and I started going out dressed in fem. While shopping I bumped into my Mom and Sister. Only for them to just look at me in disgust and start making remarks about how I'm fucking my life up and I should just stay locked up in my apartment and never come out. I cried and left my groceries and went home. My mom called me just to yell and insult me some more so I hung up on here. I woke up the next day  and logged onto facebook just to see how my brothers and my mom was were posting and telling everyone how I'm a tranny and how much I fucked up in head and need to be locked up. She called my work and said God knows what and a few days later I'm fired from some BS I know they made up just because I'm a Transsexual because they were acting weird around me the last few days before they fired me. I was pissed as you might of guessed and went over to my parents house to yell at her about it. (Wished I never went) After yelling back and forths with my mom and her saying If she new I was gonna turn out this way she would have just aborted me. I just broke down crying while my 2 brothers laugh and my dad didnt say anything. None of my family, wants anything to do with me, nor do my friends talk to me anymore. A few of the said they was ok with me transitioning just to never hang out with me or text me anymore. eventually cutting ties with me. After using up all my savings I was saving up for transitioning and finally get kicked out of my apartment and living in my car the for about a week now. I'm just tired of it all. What better day then to end it all then on the day I was born. 

Seeing as Pills didn't work the first time and reading how quite a few people survive on pills or hanging themselves and me not having a gun. Since I can't swim. I about to head to the nearby lake, walk to the center of the bridge where the lake is deep take the rope and the cinder block I put in my trunk earlier today and tying it to my leg just incase I try to swim up, and drown myself. Hopefully waiting till I hit the bottom of the water and opening my mouth and trying to swallow as much water as I can will help make it go by a bit faster.

Very rarely I get glimpses of motivation but as soon as something isn't the way I thought it would be I plummet and lose all hope for my future and my life.  

Every day I think about how I want to die and ways of doing it and when I should do it. I think the only thing stopping me from doing it is how it would affect my family but lately I can't help myself from thinking about how they might not care. I usually can convince myself they will but lately it had been getting harder.

I can't maintain a normal sleep schedule anymore, now I just sleep till 5pm and am awake till 8am. I've tried to talk to family or even councilors about what is happening but I've lost trust in telling my family these things and the last councilor started to ignore our calls to book appointments.  Whenever I do try to tell people how I feel I can't fully tell them the truth and end up lying to them so they don't have to worry.

I hate everything about myself, I hate my hobbies I hate how I am a failure and I hate how I put on a mask to keep my friends and family from worrying. More and more lately I just don't see the point of living and I'm struggling keeping my emotions in check. One minute I'll be ""happy"" sitting there watching a show and the next minute I'll be super sad thinking about how I want to die or super angry wanting to break something.

I don't know why I posted this on here maybe it's a last ditch effort to see if anyone bothers to reply or say something that might help. I fear that one day something will happen with a close family member or friend that will be the breaking point and I won't be able to convince myself not to end my life. ",1

"I'm just gonna not make any sense here for a while.I really don't know what's wrong with me. I've always been like this, the tiniest argument or foul word will completely destroy me.  I never talk to anyone, because I'm terrified of rejection or disapproval.  But the strange thing is, when I do talk, people seem to like me.  
My best friends would tell you (or rather have told other people) that I have no personality. I simply act like whoever I'm hanging out with, and they're 100% true. I hang out with people because it makes me feel normal, but most of them only talk to me because they *think* I'm normal.  It usually takes about a month or so of knowing someone before they realize I'm different than who I pretend to be, and slowly cut off every tie we have.   
So then there's alcohol. Alcohol is what I turned to a few weeks before the only person in the entire world who understood me hung himself to death while masturbating.  So, that's how my cousin died... he was pretty much a big brother, he always around, the only other DUDE in our family.  Dead as shit, naked with a god damn belt around his neck.
So then there was my girlfriend.  I started dating her a few weeks later, and not until *two years* later did I find out she was an actual nut. She was insane, and would always scream at me and throw beer bottles and shit because she didn't think I loved her, and for some dumbass reason I kept trying to convince her I *did*, because for some dumbass reason, I *did* love her, and all the while feeding my alcoholism.  Then she ran off with my best friend, feeding him the same lies about me she fed me about her ex-boyfriend, about how I beat her and hit her every night, to the point she was actually describing things that *she* did as if I did them.  
So I broke up with her, terribly, and moved back home, where I am now facing a year of jail for getting a DUI that violated my probation for psychedelic mushrooms that weren't even mine.  And although real life for the past three years has seemed like mindless distractions from thinking about killing myself, I've only ever *seriously* considered it three times, and every. single. time. i regret not killing myself.  I always wait around hoping things will get better, and all of a fucking sudden, I just lose a handful of friends who probably never fucking liked me to begin with and I'm going to jail, or somebody's dead.  
All I can think about is if my cousin just hadn't fucking killed himself, I could, because my family can't take another trauma.  I hate being like this, but craziness runs in our family, especially in the males.  
I have a high IQ which I view as like having a quad-core processor on a linux computer with 512MB ram designed to do nothing but word processing.  The only things I'm good at are making music which will never make me any money, and talking to people which is simply something I'm completely good at fucking faking.  And on top of this, I don't have any money, we are literally fucking poor, I make 8 bucks an hour and my dad makes minimum wage, the only reason we haven't lost our house is because my Grandma who leases it to us stopped charging so they could afford lawyers to cover up the fucking shame they feel like I've shat all over their family.  
I'm twenty one.  Only twenty fucking one.  not even almost twenty two.  How much longer will it be before my fucking brains starts being normal again.",1
"It's the only option that's sure to make me happier than I am nowI can't handle my depression. Therapy makes me more and more anxious. I don't know myself. I can't discern my personality from what I think my personality should be. Being asked relentless questions about what makes me feel depressed results in me hazarding guesses that are certainly wrong but the therapists seize and run with despite my reluctance. I have no idea what I enjoy, I can't remember being genuinely happy rather than momentary pleasure. I can't see me taking any options in future other than suicide. It feels like my life has been about waiting for death for some time but frankly I can't be bothered to wait.

"Like, I need a reason to live... As it is now death would be so much easier to avoid all this bullshit :(Go to an indoctrination program with shitty curriculum that does disproportionate harm to good, go to college because you have no fucking choice so that you can spend huge chunks of your life in the world of college debt enslavement that is backed by a culture that blindly approves of culture (and stigmatizes it's rejectors), all so that you (not to imply at all that a college degree guarantees it) can forcibly expend dozens of hours a week for the concluding 4-6 decades of your life crushing your soul at a job you hate going to just so that you can afford to finance the bedrock of a life that'll be dominated by you working...

The world of wage slavery...

I've begun not to hate life, but to determine that I have no reason to live. I used to think ""fuck life"", but I now think ""might as well die, no benefit"". I hate work. Work is killing me. If my office sold instantly fatal pills........................

Every day, I return home from work devoid of any spirit or life. I engage in pathetic escapism to keep myself sane -- but it's superficial stuff like video games and entertainment. It keeps my mind off of it for a while, but it isn't permanent and as the toll of work grows on me it isn't going to keep me alive.

And I'm not having any kids. Not only do I know that I am not nearly of the responsibility/confidence needed to have kids (I can't take care of myself so why a kid), but I, at least if I wasn't without a secure income, would NEVER want a human being to grow up in this world. This world is shit -- I hate life, I never chose to be born, and in my personal mind (I would never impose this or this idea on others) I'd be committing a morally juvious act by forcing another life into this world. (Once again, I am not trying to impose this ideas on others, I respect others' right to have kids and this is solely the result of my ideas, circumstances and biases). In other words: Distaste of Life + Unstable Life = No Kids for Me.

I frankly have concluded that suicide would be an easier choice. If I live, I, unless I want to be trapped in poverty, will be forced to tirelessly work. An aromantic (the thought of romance is just unappealing to me) and not with any plans to have any kids,  I don't have any natural reasons to live for. I'm not going to spend the next 5 decades of my life tirelessly working so that I can live a life of hedonism.

My basic conclusion as of this quarter-life crisis is this: ""Life may be manageable, reasoned or worth it for others, but it isn't for me"". Most people have something (be it surviving family members or their own kids) to live for, but I can't accept that. I am not the type of person who can cope with stress and pressure too well, and in this world of wage slavery that I almost certainly will not see the end of, I won't like it. I know, no one likes wage slavery, but I can't deal with it (even if the rest of you can).

Like, I can't stand life, it's fucking relentlessly difficult bullshit, I don't subscribe to any religions so I'm convinced that death is an eternal sleep that has no benefits/drawbacks... Like WHY IN THE WORLD SHOULDN'T I GRANT MY SOUL AN ETERNAL REST?!?!?!?!?

Okay, on a more sane note... anyone have any words? Believe it or not, part of me wants to live, but I need a reason or a motivator, and I can't find one.

Any help? Thanks for reading and replying.",1

"Losing hope. Don't know what to do.Before I get any grief, I am well aware that I have it better than a lot of people. Ok here’s the story. 

I am a fresh college graduate and am currently looking for work. I am the sort of person that absolutely abhors having free time to themselves. It doesn’t help that I don’t have much of a family (only child to a single mother, with no extended family). The holidays are harder for me, I usually try to spend them passed out.
I have only maybe 1 friend, and even then, they’re an ex-boyfriend who is 15 years older than I am (I’m 22). We dated 3 years ago but things went sour fast. We still chat almost every day, but he’s got other things going on in his life, of course. Acquaintances who know the both of us say that I’ve become addicted to his presence in my life, and I’d have to agree. It’s become almost toxic at this point. I wish I had something better going on in my life, just so I wouldn’t feel so emotionally dependent on him. 

Anyway, I’m trying my best to reach out to people, but since I live in a relatively small city most people are busy with work almost always, that or they blow me off. I don’t feel as if I’m a very easy people to get along with (why else would I have 0 friends?). I’m trying to work on that though. 

I feel hopeless. I need friends but I don’t know how to go about that. I feel like I need money to go out, but seeing as I’m not-yet-employed. I hope I find a job soon, otherwise I’m going to do something harmful to myself, just so I don’t have to put up with this sort of loneliness. ",1
"I'm too depressed to do anything at allabout: I have had a major depression for 1 year now.

I can't take a shower, do my projects, do homework, or go to school anymore. It's so difficult. Nothing in life is enjoyable anymore. I can't find joy in anything ever, I used to like sewing, drawing, painting, listening to music, watching anime, but now the more I do any of these, the more I'll have things to lose. Also, I see them as sickening and pointless now. All I do now is binge on food and sleep.

In the mid-stages of my depression I used music as a way of relief or a distraction from my depression, but it seems like my depression keeps building up in the background, once I remember my depression, it strikes double hard. I'm so depressed and I think of suicide everyday, how good of an idea is to give a person on the verge of shooting their brains out projects and homeworks and expect them to get done when they can't even keep themselves alive and sane?
How do I get shit done?

P,S Don't give me the ""talk to someone from your friends or family about your problems"" I can't do that because no one agrees with me and no one will accept who I am or what I believe in, if I do so they will probably disown me or kill me.

"I have to say this somewhereI have never wanted to die so bad in my life. I'm so empty and disgusted with myself.

I sit in front of a computer all day without seeing anyone other than my parents, and me and my mother barely get along. She's mean to me, she gossips about me to all of her friends and I hate it. I'm not even a person, at least no one treats me like one. I stay up till 3 in the morning every night and wake up at 8.

"I was the only person he could trust. Treat people like people!Bad format because mobile.
Back in sixth grade there was this kind of annoying kid people seemed to dislike. I even kind of disliked him at first, until we became friends.

When I found out more about him, it turned out he was a wonderful person. I naturally tried to get people to stop telling him to go away or ignore him, but I wasn’t a very assertive person and only got a few people to be friends with him.  

A few months go by and during that time we’re good friends. One day in math class (we sit next to each coincidentally) while everyone chattering away he confesses: He told me that in the second grade he tried to kill himself 3 times. He said that whenever he’s sad he has to take his banana pills (I assume dopamine pills) and was saying all of this in a kind of cheery tone of voice. I just couldn’t smile because of how grim it was. 

I haven’t told any of my close friends yet that used to call him annoying. I’m posting this here as a point that you never know someone’s back story. I only managed to become close friends with him before he could confess, and I was probably the only person he could trust.",1
"I don't buy in to these reasons to livePeople are telling me the same things again and again. ""You have a family and they need you."" Type stuff. I was laid off from my job in August and after well over 100 applications, career coach, professionally made resume, no gaps in work history till now, 13 years with the same company, and referrals to certain positions I'm still hopeless. I'm contributing nothing to my family. I provide nothing financially and emotionally I'm angry and not supportive. I see my wife walk around on eggshells and now my daughter because they don't want to upset me. 

I'm an alcoholic on and off. No legal troubles or abuse. This has made my wife want to send me off to rehab for as long as it takes. I have distanced myself from my friends because we would all drink and I can't be around that. 

Other things, mom died in August of last year, Grandma who was basically my mom died in September,  dad was diagnosed with cancer two weeks after that, a few weeks later he was diagnosed with another cancer, I mentioned being laid off, I caught my wife talking to another guy, and most recently I totaled my car. So a lot has happened in the last year. 

I'm done with it. I'm tired of waiting for the next bad thing to happen and to just be a drain on my family financially and emotionally. 

The other day I slit my left wrist but it wasn't deep enough. I hear hanging yourself is the way to go. I have written most of my suicide letter so I think that's about it.

"I know my thought is fucked up and I can't help it. Can someone maybe make me realise how wrong I am?I have seen a lot of posts talking about how they are still here just because they don't want to upset their families. I totally get that as I myself is experiencing the same thing as well. I have not done it because I know my parents care about me and I can't even imagine how they would react if I'm gone, let alone how it would hurt them or how my other dickhead relatives might judge them.

To approach a problem, I always like to see it almost from a third-person-angle. This lets me think of a solution in an objective way like an emotionless robot.

Back to the focus of this post. I know this can sound very fucked up but thats the solution I came up with. Now objectively speaking, the problem that I'm dealing with is 'I want to kill myself but I can't because it will upset my parents and I don't want them to go though that'. That means, the obstacle is the very fact that 'my parents will stay alive after I make the move'. I think the solution is pretty obvious at this point and I can already sense the disgust of people reading this towards me. That's right, what about, I kill them first, then there will be nothing stopping me to achieve my goal. After they are gone, there will be nothing holding me back, no need to worry about how sad they will be, no need to worry about how they will deal with their lives after I'm gone, nothing, finally.

I know some of you might think that it is not that easy for this plan to work in practice. But honestly, my parents have complete trust on me and we have really good relationships. It would not be difficult to put a knife in their throats or just slice them open, one by one.

I know this is very selfish, but isn't this what suicide is all about? We can't stand to live with whatever we are dealing with anymore and that's why we want an escape, once and for all. Most likely though, I will never have the guts to actually go with this plan but the fact that I can even come up with this whole idea does bother me from time to time. But then again, I would always tell myself, 'isn't this the most direct way to solve this problem?'.

I apologise if I make your day even worse by making this post. I'm so sorry.",1

I guess I'll get down to the point of my post. Basically I pretty much messed up my grades this semester of university. It all started when I started failing one of my harder courses. I figured I wasn't doing well because I wasn't putting in enough time into the class, so I started focusing on this class. Unfortunately this caused my grades in my other classes to fall. Now it's finals week and I'm pretty sure I've failed the 3 finals I've taken already. The final for the class that I was initially struggling with is today, and quite honestly even though I've studied I still think I will fail it. I'm not sure what would happen if I failed all (or most) of my classes this semester. Would I only get put on academic probation or worst. I'm quite sure this will affect my financial aid and that could single-handedly make it difficult to complete my degree. (I'm already more than half way done). I come from a poor background and education seems to be the only way out of that mess. I already have $30000 in debt and if I can't finish my degree there's no way in hell I can pay all of that back and live a decent life. I'll be even worse off than when I started, (and I'd die before I'd return to that). I just wanted there to be some evidence so that if I were to do something ""stupid"" due to, what seems like, an inevitably bad ending no one will be wondering ""why?"". Anyway the test is in 2 hours and we'll be receiving our grades in the next week or so and then soon after that I'll know for sure what the consequences are concerning my education. Hopefully that's enough time for me to get the gumption to end this shit (my life) if the situation turns out the way I described above. I already have a 9mm pistol with some hornady ammo loaded...",1

"Why am I here?I have had suicidal thoughts that I can recall back to 7th grade. I even remember cutting myself in 8th grade. I don't think my parents ever found out. I am now 25 and have been living with my parents since having graduated from college a year ago. I smoke cannabis every night, rarely drink alcohol (Average 2 drinks per week, if that), and am not currently prescribed to any medication. I have talked to a few counselors and been prescribed all sorts of things from Adderall to Wellbutrin over my life, and I have grown to despise the pharmaceutical industry.  I haven't been prescribed to anything in over 4 years now and I never thought they helped very much. I was diagnosed with General Anxiety Disorder and ADHD when I was in 9th or 10th grade.


I feel like while growing up, I was always more concerned with girls and fitting in with my friends than on actually trying to make something of myself. I had some really great times in college and some extremely shitty times. I'm talking being fucked over by friends hardcore and being put in jail multiple times, on top of pretty heavy depression between breakups...that sort of thing.  Now, I have a useless degree and am living with my parents. I recently quit a job I had for 9 months and am planning on wandering the world with the money I saved from that, hoping getting out in the world and seeing things might help me. I just don't know what's wrong with me. 


I act like a complete asshole to my parents, who have given me the world and are the coolest and sweetest parents anyone could ask for. I feel like I am a burden on them (they threatened kicking me out about 6 months ago because they couldn't handle my attitude. that also happened the night after I told my dad I didn't believe in Christianity. I retaliated by telling them I don't appreciate being given an ultimatum ((either seek counseling or leave)) in a handwritten note left on the kitchen counter) and feel like my attitude has greatly affected our relationship. 

One of the main things preventing me from doing something drastic is the thought of the devastation that my parents would suffer through. My mothers brother killed himself, as did her cousin, and my dad's dad was an alcoholic who was never around and died when he was young.

I feel like all my friends are doing something with their lives and I am not.",1

I'm just scared as to what will happen when I finally find the best way to say what I mean. I'm getting closer every day. I know it. My birthday is tomorrow. My 21st actually. I have no plans. My mom offered to take me to the only bar in town. She invited my dad and brother. They don't want to go so I guess it's just me and her.

"Poem- SuicideI sit by the balcony 

I stood by the ledge

I imagined myself jumping down

I closed my eyes

I held a kitchen knife

I held it near to my throat, enough to slice

I inserted the blade through my skin

My blood flowed like a never ending stream 

I tied a rope to the ceiling

I looked at the rope, 

With this anxious feeling

I closed my eyes

I opened my eyes,

for the first time in a while

sweat rolling down my forehead,

I tried to smile

I can barely leave my house 6 days out of the week so how the fuck am I going to be ok to work any day. If I fuck up my interview that gives me more time I guess. My ex who I was slowly fixing things with saw that I like a shit ton of girls pictures on instagram. It sounds shallow and sick as fuck but thats all I want to do. Sleep around. But it doesnt work because I cant leave the house because I feel like shit. I have no other goals or ambitions. I literally can't do this anymore. I just need the courage.,1

"Sometimes it's a struggle.I'm a coke addict.

it's one of, if not THE main reason I tried to kill myself on boxing day 2 years ago.

I've had help with the drug addiction but I'm still using, sometimes I think I should have found a higher bridge to jump off, death means I don't have to take this horrible drug anymore. Everytime I go a few weeks or an entire month without using I relapse. I need to understand why I do this? without this answer all I'm doing is edging closer to that edge where I'll try and finish off the job this time. Next time there won't be any second chances, this time I won't be waking up in hospital in ICU. The second time I do it, I'll make sure I die this time, walking in front of a train appeals to me. nice and quick, I just need to make sure the trains travelling quick enough for me to not feel anything. Throwing myself off a bridge didn't work so I guess that's the next best thing. I'm not at this point yet but if I don't/can't kick this drug addiction then i'll arrive at that point. it's just the question of when, not if. 

Sure, it upsets me that I'll leave family and freinds behind but guess what? The same thing I thought about when I last tried to end my life.

Once you're dead, you won't even know you've been alive so they'll be no hard feelings. I'd love for someone to tell me the answer to that one.

I'll cease to remember when everything goes black and my heart stops beating. I've always wondered if there's an afterlife. hopefully be alot better than being addicted to drugs eh?",1

My parents found out Iâ€™m vaping

I have nobody to talk to at all 

I have been banned from going out on my bike, to the the basketball courts, anywhere really without parental advisory. 


I have no electronics anymore, besides a TV that doesnâ€™t barely work. 




I feel so fucking alone and honestly if I didnâ€™t have family and friends Iâ€™d kill myself right now. I feel like such a fucking failure, hell I am a failure. 


Everything I do always comes back to kick me in the face. 

My parents are fucking angry at me and I mean very angry.

Even trying to explain that vaping isnâ€™t harmful in moderation, they believe the mediaâ€™s bullshit on how horrible it is.

"Well, I said I would be back here, if not for her then for myself...Not too long ago I made [a post](http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fig94/losing_so_hopeless_situation_dont_know_what_to_do/) about my girlfriend of five years. It was a long distance relationship that we both fought hard to maintain, making trips back and forth over the years and ultimately we were finally to move in together once things got sorted.

Shortly after that post, things got better, we did our usual online things, we laughed, we loved, and everything seemed fine. She brought up that her family was moving and she was quitting her job as a result and I had hope that she would get out of that rut and we could finally get back to normal...until she completely and utterly abandoned me.

The day she left, she stopped responding to my calls, my texts, and left me with no other method of contact. The only reason I even know she is alive is because she barely responded to my one pleading text to know at least that much. At this point, I'm not sure I even want to know that anymore. I was silent for days, and then the questions came, and I kept asking her how she could do this, why, any fucking reason at all, and she won't even give me the courtesy of a honest goodbye or a proper answer. So here I'm left, five years of my life crushed, utterly betrayed, with more questions than answers. I don't know what to do, I don't know how I'm supposed to fucking function in life like this. She was the only one in this world I trusted, and she goes and does this. It's been nearly a week now. I have to be at work in four hours and I have no idea how I'm going to fucking keep it together in front of other people let alone perform my job like this. I'm shattered.

Update1: And things only get worse. I called her house line, she must have forgotten I had it. I always kept it just in case even though we never used it, because being so far away, if something happened to her, the only people I would have to reach out to would be her family. As I feared, they picked up. She never moved, nobody moved. I asked where she was and all I could find out even before identifying myself was that she went away on a long trip and they don't know when she will be back. So not only has she abandoned me, but she lied and cheated on me as well. I should be fucking furious and all I can do is break down in tears, because all I remember is the girl I used to love, and all I want is to say goodbye, but she won't even let met do that. I didn't want it to end, and I can't believe it has to end like this..

Update2: I couldn't let things stand at that. I called her family again and this time was able to get a bit more out of them. She apparently transferred from where she was working now to a store in another state. She told her family she was going to go out there to get away and try to go to college there. I don't entirely believe that part, but she has kept in constant contact with her grandmother and father. Apparently, she hates it out there and is looking to come back to her house now. I had visted several times and her family and mine got along really well, I had her fathers blessings and we were on good terms. When he found out the story that was given to me, he was less than pleased. He's been acting as a liaison between me and her for the moment. The story she gave him about our relationship is almost a mirror image of the truth however. She claimed that she wanted to move in with me and that I wasn't on the same page and so forth, when I had offered to find a place numerous times with her, but she did not want to leave her elderly grandmother behind because her aunt/uncle/other relatives were leeches and would take advantage of her. It was a shitty situation for a while because I was stuck between wanting to be with her, but knowing that for that time to come her grandma would have to die, and she's a nice woman who I think would rather have had videos of her granddaughters wedding then have her wait out her deathbed. That's besides the point though. Ultimately it looks like it comes back to the depression and a suspected hormonal imbalance that seemed to begin when they switched the type of pill she was taking (she's been having issues with the pill, even though I told her several times to ease herself off it and stop. She didn't have insurance for some time, so kept on it because she didn't want to lose the prescription, and it helped with her with some medical problems). She more or less is having a manic depressive breakdown right now. I wouldn't have brought the family into this if I wasn't concerned for her well being. But I knew this wasn't her, and I knew she was having problems with this before this happened, and this is completely uncharacteristic of her. For now all I can do is wait. She will listen to her father, and he said I can contact him at any time. He is going to keep in contact with her and make sure she's ok. Knowing that I have some method of contact, that her family is still watching out for her, and what has happened/where she is still worries me, but at least I can make it through the day without being a destroyed wreck. I barely talked to anyone at work, and I've been avoiding everyone. I'm not going to be happy until this gets resolved, even if we can't work this out, I need to know that she's safe and that she's happy. I can't just move on with my life knowing I failed her like this. I wanted a better life for her, and I won't feel at ease until she has it, even if I'm not in it. ",1

It's not that I don't try. I do my best over the years, but keep failing. It seems all things are there to bring me down. One by one, all important people left my life.

The urge to end my life is now stronger than ever. I literally think about it like 24/7. I keep questioning my sanity, and I think I could just suddenly end it all.

"Bit by bit I’m subconsciously distancing myself from the only people who care about meI have 2 brothers, a step dad and a dad, my mom and my sister and then my 81 year old grandma. So like 7 people in the world care about my existence. 

I’ve been getting heated with my parents. A month ago I stopped talking to my mom for a month after a fight and today I had an argument with my dad. It’s a manifestation of what I don’t want to happen, to be abandoned by everyone and now it’s becoming a reality.

Since I’ve been talking about suicide for a while and I’m more open about it to my family they have either stopped caring or don’t entertain it anymore. What they probably don’t know is I have tried and failed just like the rest of the shit I do in my life. 

I’m thinking the part of me that wants to die is responsible for the conspiracy theories about my family hating me which then leads me into deep thoughts of how I’ll end it. I’ve thought hard and I like cutting myself so that’s how I’ll end it.

I have no friends and my family knows I’m a piece of shit. I don’t know how to do anything normal because everything feels controlled like I’m a robot being given commands.

Don’t end up like me. If you really care about the only people who give a shit you’re alive then don’t take them for granted. Learn how to not say what’s on your mind because it can hurt others. Control your anger. Seek professional help instead of getting it from strangers on the internet who say they care but don’t.

I’m 21 on June 24th, sometime around my 21 years in my life I will die from my own suicide. Some part of me eagerly awaits what’s beyond this life but another part is scared. I’m done though really",1

i just got home, was still in my school clothes, still wearing my shoes. my dad was in the garage, working on something. i won't go into details, but i came literally one move away from killing myself. if i made that one, slight movement, i could have done it. i could have made it all go away. i literally got an intense feeling in my body, knowing how close i was to dying.

but i heard my dad make some loud noise from the garage and i thought about it. and i remembered suddenly when my brother got sick, and how sad my dad was because my brother inherited it from him. i remembered how i was sitting in the living room and i heard him say to my mom, really sadly, ""I'm sorry."" and i remember how my mom told me later about how he cried.

never before or since have i heard or seen my dad cry.

and i kept thinking about how he would hear a noise and walk in and see me dead and i thought how *fucked up* that would be to do to my dad, to make him see his daughter dead in the kitchen and i stopped and ran up to my room and pushed it out of my head because i had homework to do and i couldn't keep thinking about it.

part of me hates myself for backing out when i was so close to ending it all and going to Heaven or wherever the souls go when they die. but part of me still feels like i made the right decision, even now, when i still want to die so badly because at least i didn't traumatize my dad. and then another part of me isn't even sure if it matters because i'll probably kill myself some other time anyway.

He says I am a disgrace to his family, and that everyone had straight A's. But me.. Apparently B and C's are bad. Apparently I can't get into any schools with that grade. I got into my preferred high school with those ""bad grades"" of mine. I know what I want to do when I am older, but I just can't go through with it. Why? Because every single day, I have to hear at least someone comment that I am going to fail in life and end up on the street.

All they care about is my grades. They don't care about me, what I do or what I want to do.


Why should I care about others? I don't even care about myself anymore. I don't even know what to do. Dying is pretty much the only option I have left, as I have nobody to go to.

"I have everything I could want...By all traditional measures, I am successful. My life has been pretty easy up until this point. My parents raised me well, never had any serious financial or emotional concerns. Everyone in my life who I care about is healthy. I am healthy. I just graduated from an elite institution and have accepted a high paying, ""prestigious"" job in the major city that I grew up in and where most of my friends live.  


I obsess about killing myself. I can't focus on anything anymore. I get distracted within minutes, drifting off into my own world, imagining ways to take my life. The only reason I haven't yet is because I don't want to pass my burden onto family and friends--they don't deserve to feel this pain. I've thought about ways to fake an accident, or how to quietly disappear. I have taken steps. I tried to kill myself in a car accident in January, but the engine of my van miraculously blew out a few hundred feet from the wall I wanted to slam into. I'm still here.  


I don't understand my purpose. I know I am not supposed to think about that kind of question for too long; greater (wo)men than me have gone crazy contemplating life's mysteries. But really, why do I do anything? What's the point of having a high paying job and living in an expensive city? Why don't I just move to an island off the coast of Colombia or Vietnam and live out my days there? 

I am 26 years old. I have been depressed for as long as I remember. I have achieved all manner of material and academic success, but the high from any achievement fades almost instantly. I feel worthless. I am directionless. I want to die. I don't think I'm being rash, and (excuse my arrogance) I think I'm fairly smart. I think I've thought this through from just about every angle. I can't rationalize my continued existence.   


I want to kill myself. Why shouldn't I?",1
"not feeling too goodI've been struggling with bipolar disorder for about as long as I can remember. Different pills, different doses, different therapists and psychiatrists, etc. I feel weird and lonely often and when I do interact with people I feel like I'm failing miserably at communicating (I slur, mumble, and stutter often; even more when nervous). But ultimately, I don't like myself and feel like I will always be a freak.

I'm terrible with relationships as well. I get too attached and then paranoid (checking phone texts while they are in the shower, for an example) and then controlling and ultimately self-destruct in front of them because I cannot handle the stress of being in a romantic relationship while being myself. 

I don't really want to live and I feel like everyone will be better off without me (classic depression statement!) 
I hate everything about me (looks, intelligence, skills in my artistic abilities, failures, dumb college degree, living with parents, inability to talk to people or make new friends, sounding like I'm mentally challenged when I talk, crippling paranoia that everyone is making fun of me when I'm not around).
I tried contacting the people who I think hate me the least and maybe go to the museum (It's national museum day!) or just sit in the car with me and listen to music but they are all busy doing stuff they don't want me involved with.

I'm planning to burn every last proof that I exist, including pictures, facebook accounts, notebooks of writings, books, movies, clothes, legal documents, saved scholastic papers, birthday cards, phone, wallet, watch, car-keys.

In my parents' closet I know where they keep their 5-shot snub-nosed revolver. After looking up where to aim the pistol (thank you, internet!), I'm going to pull the trigger. 
I was holding it in my hands today. It smelt metallic and slightly-oily.

Afterwards everyone will move onto better things then worrying about me like colonoscopies or pap-smears or tickling the uvula with dirty fingernails.

tl;dr: 
hate self. wishes I wasn't so weird and lonely. planning on killing self. Enjoys one last self-pitying post. 

EDIT: maybe I should add that I've been hospitalized twice within the past year and if I decide against the gun method I have a chosen parking lot roof that'll be reliable (where they talked me off before my first hospitalization). I don't see myself getting better anytime soon. ",1

I think I may have some sort of mental issue, because when they yell at me I almost always yell back. I know I really shouldn't, but for some reason I can't help it. 

Last night my mom lashed out at me again, and didn't let me explain what could easily be fixed. I got so frustrated that I yelled back for a long time until I felt my dad's fist hit the back of my skull. I ran to my bedroom and locked it before he could do anything else. I heard my dad yelling and mom crying upstairs. Soon my dad began pounding on my door and screaming to let him in. I stayed silent, hoping he would go away. Nope. He grabbed a key and began punching my chest and stomach until I puked blood onto my pillow.

—

I’m so done with life. I’m beyond depressed 24/7 and I just don’t want to do it anymore. :’( 

I’ve been researching how to die, but it’s all so complicated and I don’t want to fail, which makes me think I’m stuck in this misery forever. 

My therapist is out of town and I’m just so fucking over this shit and don’t really have anyone to talk to. 

So I’ve been researching. 

The hardest and shittiest thing is that my best friend went from suicide and I’m like ready to use his method. But he’s smarter and braver than me. 

I don’t know why I’m even writing this. I’m never going to follow through. I guess I just need to vent. 

I’ve seen what suicide does to friends and families for times than I can count, and I believe everyone, under the right circumstances, deserves the right to die. However, I don’t think I’m one of them. He had terminal liver failure with no chance at an organ transplant because of other health issues, so he was given a death sentence by his doctors. My other friend had MS and was also given a death sentence at 33 years old. They both passed in the exact same way, which feeds into bravery for me. 

Anyway. I don’t know. I’m just so tired of being alive and having to struggle through every since day of my deep depression. Nothing helps. I’m on lots of meds and see a therapist weekly. I’ve been in and out of inpatient, PHP, and IOP, and nothing helps. Nothing. 

I’d truly love any advice on how to get through my almost 9 months of deep, unending, severe depression (with one single week of sanity) without considering ending my stupid, boring, pointless life. 

Please do NOT suggest that 9 months of depression isn’t “as bad” as yours or someone else’s. Until you suffer for schizoaffective that won’t help me as advice or “it could be worse.” I’ve suffered from severe depression since age 12 and it’s a miracle I’m still even here. 

I’m unpopular, have few friends, and nobody would really miss me if I was gone. Nobody. 

My best friend never had a funeral or even a memorial service, and I’m guessing it would be the same for me. Nobody cares. My parents would, but that’s about it. Nobody at work would probably even notice if I disappeared. 

Fuck. I don’t know. 

Any advice here would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.  I hope I didn’t break any rules. If I did, please let me know. 

Thanks. 

Tldr; I’m tired of my life, know how I want to die, etc. ",1

"I can't forgive myselfI can’t forgive myself. My whole life I’ve been taken care of, regardless of the situation, someone has always been there to pick up the slack I’ve left behind and there has been a lot of it. I have been able to coast through life, putting minimum effort into everything I do; knowing someone else will always do the rest for me. Eventually that turned into letting people do all of it for me, letting down the people who cared most about me in the world, abusing their love and their trust. I’d say whatever people wanted to hear just to extend the free ride I was on, I hated myself for this, I was depressed and it was just so damn easy to not do anything.  This is not something you can carry on forever, I think somewhere inside me I knew that, but given the choice between starting the hardest journey you’ve ever gone on, and continuing down the road I’ve been going down whole life, I chose the easiest route like I do with everything.


I guess the whole pattern started with my mother. She would let me bargain with her over pretty much anything, there was no rule I couldn't get around if I formulated a strong enough argument. My parents divorced when I was 5 years old and my mother was given custody. We moved frequently over my whole life, I think the longest I stayed in one place was 3 years while I lived with her. We originally bought a house about 4 hours away from where my father lived, but it soon became apparent that we needed to be closer to him, seeing him once every 2 weeks just wasn't enough. We ended up moving 3 times that year ending right back where we started 4 hours from my father. We lasted one more year in that town, I was 10 years old when my mother decided she wanted to teach her religion in china. We lived in china for 2 years, my mother taught English to support us and I ended up enrolled in a full Chinese school for the first year, I didn't speak a word of the language. I put in no effort to learn the language, I hated the fact that I had been brought away from my friends to live there and I was determined to make the worst of it. When I returned from china I had learned almost none of the language, if I had put the effort in I probably could have been fluent. What a waste, that's all I can think of looking back on basically every stage of my life. 


When I returned from China I had changed significantly, before going I was very outgoing and confident, when I returned I was shy and wouldn't stick up for myself. I'm not sure what made me change, I've tried to pinpoint it for a while but I can never come up with anything. Regardless I still had good friends from when I had lived in this town before, so the first 2 years of high school were alright. In school I never put any effort in, I can't remember doing any homework and always got by doing the minimum. My teachers liked me, I was nice and polite, not your typical struggling student. We moved more times before I completed high school, but it's getting tiresome writing about it. In grade 10 my parents wondered why my grades were so bad, so they decided to get my IQ tested. I was diagnosed with something called non-verbal learning disorder, this basically means I have a huge difference between my verbal IQ and my Performance IQ. In my case I have a gifted verbal IQ and a below average Performance IQ, apparently differences of that size are extremely rare. They blamed this for my poor grades and lack of effort, because I can articulate thoughts and ideas in my head very easily but translating them to the real world is very difficult for me.
 

Anyway I moved one last time, this time to live in the same town as my girlfriend at the time. Stupid, I know, but when your 16 it can seem pretty important. I lived with a family that took in foreign exchange students and my dad paid my rent there. Of course within the first few months of living there my all important relationship fell apart. In grade 12 I ended up dating an amazing girl, she was christian and had been bullied as a child so she had low self esteem and wasn't very used to male attention. We dated a full year before we had sex, she picked her grad night, I don't think I've ever had a more emotionally charged experience than that. We continued dating, I got a crappy job working at a call center instead of going to college, I just couldn't even imagine my self going back to school at that point. It turns out though, my ability to slack wasn't only limited to school, I eventually stopped going to work and ended up getting fired. I tried going to college twice after that dropped out both times, I just couldn't apply myself, I would let absolutely any tiny excuse get in the way of me attending class or doing homework. I started working at a convenience store and didn't mind it for a while, I still slacked off though and ended up hating it and quitting. I was still with my girlfriend all this time, we had probably been together 4 years at this point, she was in her 3rd year of university and I was doing nothing. 


I wanted badly to make a change, I tried going to china and teaching English while staying with my mother (yeah she lives there now). I did alright but again, I just can't bring myself to put the effort in, I don't know why I just cannot bring myself to do it, no matter how hard I try. Video games were my most convenient escape, it didn't help that they were often a social connection between me and my friends, though it took me a long time to admit it, I was addicted to them and the escape from reality they provided. I made a little bit of money in china, a lot of it was working with my mother at the school she taught at, it was the easiest way to get work. I just didn't have the drive to go out and apply at the schools looking for people. That night I got back from china my girlfriend had brought me my meal at the airport and rented us a hotel for the night. I told her I was thinking about going back to china, a friend of my mothers had offered me a good work opportunity there. She didn't want to go another 3 months without seeing me, she put her school on hold and went back to china with me, where I ended up achieving nothing. She worked her ass off teaching English, something she hated, just for us to be able to afford the flights home. 


Still after all that she didn't hate me, she did her best to support and motivate me.
We moved in together, during her last semester of university and I went back to school. I didn't drop out this time, but still put in almost no effort. I did well in a few classes, failed one, and was average in the others. She graduated with a degree in animal biology with amazing grades and was on the deans list every year, she got a job working as an assay technician while she applied for veterinary school. I just sat at home for almost a full year rarely going out, sometimes even ignoring her, I had become her dependent rather than her partner. She didn't get into vet school her first attempt, it's very competitive here in Canada and almost no one gets in their first year applying. So she continued to work and I continued to do nothing, I refused to go out and visit her work friends with her, to this day most have never even met me. I just didn't want to do anything, my self esteem was shot, and getting a job seemed impossible. I knew I was alienating the one person I cared about, I couldn't change though no matter how much I fought myself, I would always lose. She literally did everything alone, worked, cooked, and cleaned. She went out with her friends alone, sometimes begging me to come with her, I very rarely did though. This carried on for about a year, we moved to a new apartment and she went to a friends wedding for a few days. When she came back she was very distant, I asked what was wrong and she said ""you don't want to know"" I asked if she was breaking up with me, and she just fell crying into my arms and nodded. I couldn't even cry, I just kept telling her how sorry I was for everything.


It really hadn't hit me yet, I moved out and started living with a friend. I can't forgive myself for what I did to the one thing I truly cared about in this world. Nothing makes me happy, it's been a month since we broke up and friends I've known since I was a teenager just seem stupid to me now, flaws I used to overlook in them are so obvious to me now I don't even want to hang out with them. This is all on top of that I was depressed before anyway, I considered suicide while we were together, but not seriously like I am now. I couldn't have done that to her, I know it would hurt her and my parents and probably my friends if I did it now, I don't think I should value their feelings over my own on the situation though. If there's one thing I know, people loving you isn't enough to get out of depression. I don't see my life going uphill from here and I don't want to live if I'm going to feel this way forever.  I hate myself and what I've wasted, all my opportunities, my relationships and my time. Even after losing all this, I still don't feel like I can make a change, I feel hopeless. The one thing that even gives me a little motivation is one day trying to make it up to my ex, showing her how I've changed, but then I think about how I don't even deserve that opportunity, I put her through hell because I couldn't even conjure up a little effort to help her.

"My Situation.Hey all. I'll try to say as much as I can. I don't need help, I don't need compassion. I want to express myself because I'm boiling up with all my feelings and I want some people to know EXACTLY what might lead me to a potential death.
Let's start with me in general. I'm a 16 yo French male. I've always been shy and I've never really had any self confidence. I've been bullied in 7th grade for being overweight, and a nerd in class. After that I became pseudo depressive, kept saying I'd kill myself but all I really wanted was a bit of attention and love. Which I didn't get but anyway.
Now... today. I'm a different person. I've become the most heartless, careless bastard you can imagine. Because I chose to. It all started with a movie I watched. I won't bother to tell you what it was but I'll tell you what made me think and become what I am today.
This movie occupies a very dear space in my heart. It showed me the side of life i deeply want to discover. It's dumb I know, but it made me realize what I'm missing in my life. I'll try to make a little sum up of what I learnt. First, friendship. I think that might have been one of the biggest parts of the movie that hit me right in the guts. That movie made me question my definition of friendship. What are friends ? Do I have any? Do I even FEEL?! And yeah. Turns out I don't feel shit for anyone. My so called friends are dicks. And I don't like them. So yeah I'm alone on the friends point of view. Second, love (on all side of things). By that I mean I saw what it's like to love somebody, wether it's your family, your friends or a girl. It mad me think that I can't.. love. I just can't. I've never met any girl I loved. They're all so.. superficial ? I dunno. After all, am I not a heartless bastard ? Third, dream context. The place the movie took place in. Man.. I hate France. I hate people here. I hate myself. I want to live where people will like me and where I'll like people, in a place where even the biggest city is appealing, sunny and full of life. I think i need to trigger that something to make me feel. I think I just miss plain happiness. 
So that's what made me become what I am today. I don't think I'll change my mind. I'm going to do bad stuff I know it. Question is when ? How And most importantly.. why not?
I'll leave you on that, fellow friends. I hope you all have a great life and fulfill your feelings just like I'd like to.

"I don't really know where to post this, but this is the subreddit I'm most familiar with...To start off with this, I'm diagnosed with bipolar disorder and panic disorder...

My boyfriend came home from cleaning up the plane crash mess in Charleston, SC this past Friday. We were fighting the whole week over really stupid stuff, but it got resolved within hours of him returning home. 

But as we were talking about it, he exclaims, ""I don't know what to do here, I've never dated anyone who was bipolar before."" It kind of hit hard, in the moment. I don't think he meant harm by it or anything, but it hurt. I've posted on here before and expressed my suicidal thoughts, and wishing to go through with it. Usually I delete my posts because I see how whiney I sound.

Last night, I went downstairs to take medicine I take at night and saw all of my pill bottles, and my pill holder. I take 11 pills a day and for me, most of my life that's been my normal. So an excess of prescription pill bottles never bothered me.

Then it clicked. He's not used to that. He's in the Air Force and isn't on any prescription medication, his parents were never on any, it wasn't something he was used to seeing or dealing with.

I went upstairs to apologize that he had to deal with me, and my episodes, or when I think it's wise to just stop taking my medication. He started crying slightly and told me I never had to apologize for that. He told me that he fully expected me to be irrational again in the future, or jump to immediately breaking up without a thought. I don't want to break up with him, but when things get hard that's always my first thought. That he is better off without me.

For the most part, I'm pretty stable. When I'm taking my medicine correctly. 

But I'm still suicidal. It's not fair to be in a relationship when I know that in the back of my mind, every day, I'm just wishing to have the guts to end it. Is it?

To take my medicine and feel half of myself. To not, and get manic episodes, but knowing the depressive is around the corner and I'll be back on this subreddit spilling my thoughts to you guys, looking at my gun, looking at my medicine, trying to figure out which way is better for me to end my life.

I don't deserve someone who is as supportive as him.",1
"Should I give in?So at school, a few of my friends told me that someone had a gun, and was threatening to shoot up the school while we were there. I ended up telling a police officer. Later that day I found out that I gave false info on the person who had the gun, so I tried to fix it but my teachers told me to stay out of it. When school let out that day, I recieved messages from the person that I said had the gun but didn't. He said that he hopes I kill myself and he wants me to cut my wrists. He said that if I ever get pregnant, he hopes my kids die. I'm 15 and already have major depression. I'm scared to go back to school because of him. Should I just give in and kill myself?",1

"I almost hung myself, but then I got high.I've been thinking about it for a while.
This morning was an especially tough one, for reasons I'll leave unknown. But in the past 3 weeks, my boyfriend's best friend shot himself, my dad has told me I am worthless, my boyfriend has told me he thought I'd be the one to kill myself first, my boss has told me that I'm a terrible worker for taking off three days for a funeral... I'm drowning. I'm only 17. And this is on top of a million other problems. But anyways.
I hung myself from my bathroom doorknob with a belt.  Everything felt like it was going fine, except I could still breathe.
I readjusted my head and BAM. 10 seconds in my body went cold, my head started to float and I thought ""Hey, I feel high as fuck"".. off of oxygen deprivation. Ended up sliding my head out and enjoying the feeling, instead. 
The one good feeling I've had in a long, long time.",1
"I'm not in love anymore.I was depressed, and she was there, so I loved her. Granted, she was different from most people, but that's not why I loved her. It's what drew me to her, but that's not why my affection became love. Or maybe it was just infatuation. Idolization, I guess. I never really knew her, I just imagined life if I did and hoped that one day I would say the right thing. She never payed much attention to me. I loved her because I needed to love.

But I don't love her anymore. It was gradual at first, I slowly began to think less and less of her, but now a switch has gone off and I don't have any semblance of emotion left.

That's scary. I don't love anyone now. Most of the people in my family are good people, but I honestly wouldn't care if they disappeared. In fact, I might consider it exciting. Nothing happens in my life.

So I'm left with no love, no passion, and no motivation. I fall asleep too late, I wake up too early, and I'm constantly hungry, but I never feel like eating. I have no friends, and I'm not sure that I want any. I like watching people more than interacting with them. That's really all I do anymore, watch people. I always feel like an alien, but it's comfortable. I don't really care what people think of me anymore. You'd think that would be liberating, but it just enables me to stop trying socially. I can't be bothered to put effort into anything.

I live in a suburb, one with houses painted in neutral colors. The trees are  dull looking at most times of day, and so is the sky. I don't want to be here, but I can't leave. I'm young, still in school, if you hadn't already guessed. I used to comfort myself with the belief that if you sit in one place long enough, you're bound to see something. But there isn't much left here that I haven't already seen. I've seen incredible things, but nothing worth sticking around for.

Definitely nothing worth living for. Things stopped being good enough once I fell out of love. And I can't wait for things to get better anymore.

TL;DR: I've fallen out of love and I have nothing left to live for.",1

Wanting to end itSo here is my deal. Im currently 18 one year removed from high school. In high school I battled major depression on and off mostly on. I didn't dare tell a soul about it. I think about killing myself all the time because of what I think in my mind. The worst part is I can't even control it. Like this shit I think about is so fucked up that I'm not even going to say what is is but trust it is bad enough for to want to kill myself. I have no idea what to do because now I'm finally not battling depression but know this shit keeps happening. I like living but the shit that comes into my mind is just unbearable. I just want it to stop. Can someone help me,1

"24/M/UK - Bad decisions and an awful starting hand has me ruined already - Checking out, see you.Started a tech-startup with friends after graduating 13 months ago. Worked 18 hrs a day on it much to my physical and mental detriment. It's meant to be a huge charitable marketplace for Uni Students to trade notes, connect with their Unions etc... Got really far but needed to get loans, took them and then things went south due to under-estimating the costs we'd need to bring it to market in a fully usable state. Now £30k in debt and my friends are equally in a mess - they've all had to stop working with me to find other work. How shitty of me huh? Leaving them all in the lurch like this.   


Been looking for a job knowing it will mean we'll have to pack up shop officially but haven't even found one in 3 months of looking pretty diligently. I am a shell of my former self, heavily depressed, reclused for over a year while working on this and have nobody around anymore - deleted my soc media accounts and got rid of my phone until recently. It's like I pre-prepared an easy exit unknowingly...   


Feel like I just woke up to the reality that this is what has happened and truthfully I think I'm going to do it in the next 7 days tops - I don't wanna hit 25 for some reason. Found a painless, easy way to go too. This will destroy my mother who raised me and my brothers alone in inner-city London... she worked so hard to just put food on the table and loves us so much. I haven't spoken to her or anyone in my family properly for just as long, I'm just stuck. I've lost over 18kg in the last year, I'm gaunt and just wrecked. Scared to go outside, unable to talk to anyone or seek therapy (if that'd even help...) just ready to die and accept whatever the consequences might be. Can't even write or talk about it publicly because it'd disqualify me as someone worthy of investment despite the idea/platform getting loads of attention this past year. I'm tired.  


**I'd just like to say that I love you all and hope you young'uns take care of your finances properly, no matter how great you feel your idea(s) are or how many people you believe it'll help. Don't jump into a startup out of University. Just don't - please. Entrepreneurship is pure hardship, and without strong characters around you, you'll end up burnt out and financially ruined too.**   


Sadly, no amount of working is going to dent this or my £60k student loans. If I do find a job, this'll be over and we'll all have to admit that it's done. If I don't, I'll probably snap sooner from sitting in front of my PC all hours of the day trying to find work and working alone on the platform. Mum is still busting her ass off to keep food on the table and electricity/gas bills paid up too, I feel awful... like I couldn't describe. Just worthless. ",1
"Trying to sedate myself to prevent suicideI'm taking enough medication to hopefully knock me out for a long while because this is the closest I have gotten before. I have what I need to end it.

I have been suicidal for as long as I can remember now. I'm 24 f. I'm medicated and in therapy. Been hospitalized twice. I've been abused mentally, physically, and molested by my own cousin as a child from the ages of 3-11. In a relationship with a female that I can't find the effort to even write the details about. I'm being pushed over the edge. No friends, not even my gf as she just told me she is living a double life and lying to me about everything. Nothing is true and nothing is real.

"Working on going in the military, struggled with weight loss.(Throwaway acc) I am a 20 year old male, enlisting in the air force. 9 months ago I was over the weight limit for my size, and so I worked really hard and exercised to drop the weight and I just barely made it in. But now I have to wait till January to actually go to basic, and I have to maintain weight to stay in

Unfortunately I let myself go, and I undid all the work I had to do, and I am trying again to re lose the weight. But now I have a deadline. If I dont make weight by mid january (today being nov 16th) I dont make it in.

I didnt do good in highschool, and I have no hope of paying for college on my own, so if I dont make it in by jan, I have nothing to really live for.

"Why Does the World Hate me?Just a quick heads up this post might be kinda lengthy so yeah, you've been warned 😆


I am honestly just so frustrated right now.  For about the past month (give or take a few weeks) I've been SUPER depressed and having thoughts of killing myself.  Why you may ask?  Because I feel like I've been let down and merely pushed away by the world.

Ever since 4th grade I've struggled with being bullied/picked on.  Now to be fair I haven't always been the most normal person, but still I feel like I HAVE always been the person people love to single out just because I'm different.

The 1 thing that I have always tryed to offer to those around me both at work and at school is kindness.  Now to be fair a lot of the adults in my life have reciprocated that motion but do you think my peers have?  F*** no!  All throughout school I really only had 5-7 true friends at one time meanwhile everyone else just pushes me aside or decides to use me because of my compassionate nature.  It truly baffles me how people just seem to hate kindness nowadays.  So what you're telling me is that you'd rather have me treat you like a ball of s*** and be rude rather than try to be nice?  Well how the F*** does that make any sense?!? 

Long story short I've just always felt like the odd one out.  Like I love that adults are usually kind but it's just not the same as being accepted by your peers if that makes sense.

Then about 1 year ago, I was diagnosed with depression.  I did go to a hospital/rehab kinda place earlier this year and while that was somewhat helpful, it really just showed me where I DON'T want to end up when I feel depressed.  So now I feel like I have to bottle all these emotions up inside me out of fear of going back to the rehab center.  I just hate having to suffer through this all alone (excluding people here on Reddit it's great knowing that I'm not the only one who feels this way).

Lastly, I've really just struggled even staying alive this week.  I have gotten to the point where I am so depressed I want to kill myself SO BAD, but the 1 thing that's stopping me is those that I'm close to, in particular one of the few close friends I have left.  She's been through a lot lately and my fear is that if I take my life, that would push her over the edge.  At the same time though, I kind of hate having to keep suffering each and every day just to keep others happy it just doesn't feel right to me.

Anyway that's all for now I just needed to vent a little.  

Thanks to anyone who's taken the time to read through this whole thing it means a lot.  :)",1

At this rate I may just be better off letting my anxiety kill me, although I'll end up buried a man in that regard huh?

"How do I stop this?I'm wondering if anyone has any advice on dealing with this, but long story short, my mother and sister found out I was raped (aaages ago) - I'm pretty sure they're in denial about things that have happened to them too. As I observed, whenever someone else is attacked, they label that person as damaged, weak and just use it against them whenever they later disagree on something, as though they are too broken to be deemed sane.

My mother dramatised it and made it about her. She keeps trying to confront me about it as though it's okay for her to ask surprise questions whenever \*she\* feels like it. Every time she does this I want to die more than ever, but demands she's entitled to know purely because of how we're related.

Firstly, for a lot of reasons I'm not going through again, I don't trust her at all. Over and over again she has proved she doesn't care. Also, when I tried to open up to her in the past about something she always threw it back in my face. Of course she denies all of this when I try to explain. At this point, idea of sharing a single thing to her about anything remotely personal makes me feel so ill. 

I would really appreciate it if someone who can relate can give me any advice on this. How do I get her to stop?",1

I was always a troubled child. I got bullied severely, mentally and physically, for most of my childhood, and it destroyed me. The main bully had befriended most of my siblings, to the point where they took sides with him, and this has, even to this day, left me emotionally detached from my family. Growing up was hell, and it wasn't until I turned 18 that things took a turn. I met a girl. 

This girl turned my life upside-down. My self-esteem shot through the roof, and she inspired me to do well in school, trust in myself, and just to be happy.

Ever since I was a young boy, I wanted to dedicate my life to helping people. I worked hard thanks to the motivation brought upon by aforementioned girl, and graduated as a therapist not long ago. I managed to get the job of my dreams.

Well. What's wrong with this picture? I'll tell you.

I'm just not that good at my job. I've always appreciated the nurturing, helpful conversations with people, but I'm much too cognitively dysorganized to be doing this job on a daily basis. I can't handle the interpersonal stress AT ALL. And I've only just had this job for a couple of weeks. Seeing as my personal economy in no way would allow me to quit (really expensive apartment with lease for minimum a year, and a really well paid job), I can't just up and leave.

Mere hours ago, my girlfriend of several years, the same girlfriend who has inspired me to  ""reach for the stars"", broke up with me. 

As a therapist, I should have some grasp on how to deal with this sort of situation, but to be frank: Apparently I don't. I feel stuck and completely alone, and I've cried my eyes out for hours. I've had suicidal thoughts and plans before, but now I see no reason to keep on going. I feel exhausted, and plan on jumping from my apartment on the 8th floor in a week. 

I wanted to tell someone before I do.",1

"I'm not suicidal, just really fucking beat up and sadI met a girl, playing an online game 5 years ago. I knew the moment I heard her voice that she was the one I wanted to be with. It took 2 years after we met for her to be available, and even close to a position to want to date again. 3 years later, and a year after being engaged she just dropped me. I quit my job, gave up college, and put all of my focus on making her happy.

She isn't a bad person, I don't resent her. It's just I planned my whole life around ""us"". I'm unemployed, I missed out on 3 years of college, and I'm all alone. I'm not a very emotional person, but every imgur story, or sappy youtube video sets me off. I can't stop crying, I just want to sleep forever.

I had a decent job interview today, so hopefully things will turn around, I just want someone to know that I'm not ok. I don't think I'm ever going to be ok. I waited for the right person and I got thrown away.",1

"Suicide staged as accidental death (parenteral alienation)I've been really struggling lately. I don't think I realized just how much I've been struggling till I admitted my deeper thoughts about my situation. I've been considering staging a suicide as an accidental death to prevent any pain on any of the people I love. So they will never know I actually did it and just think it was a freak accident or say me driving off a bridge out in the middle of nowhere late at night with some alcohol in my system. They cops would just chop it up to drinking an driving (accidents happen).  


I have been separated from my daughter after a divorce where I am guilty of many mistakes. I have owned those mistakes, but not all the mistakes were mine. I also don't think any of those mistakes should be reasons or justifications to deprive me of my daughter through parenteral alienation not from parent to child, but from parent to parent. There is almost no resources about early age parenteral alienation when done by extreme character sabotage from parent to parent making it so I fully withdrew from contact with my ex due to extreme emotional abuse especially in regard to me being a father.   


I feel like I'm grieving the loss of my daughter every single day. It feels like she's dead to me. I wake up every day thinking that she is no longer alive to me. I think of all the things I'm missing how she is growing up without me. I imagine a life where she is alive to me and I feel the loss all over again. What's even worse is to know that she is actually alive and the realization that I'm a coward it's to much to bear. My ex I believe is also trying to replace me with her own father trying to turn my daughters maternal grandfather into her father.  


I want to just kill myself every single day when I think about this. I have one more class left and I will finally graduate college. I have a very hard degree, and part of me has been thinking I will kill myself after I graduate as a final fuck you to everyone that ever doubted me.

&amp;#x200B;

Everyone loves to tell me my daughter needs me, but I don't feel like she does. Every single day I slowly feel like it's fading away. I worry what it will do to her when she becomes a teenager and asks her mother where I live and how heart broken and hurt she will feel when she realizes I'm just a sort drive away. She will demand answers that I won't be able to give her.   


I also know that if she knows I killed myself it will greatly affect her, but if I just die in a freak accident she will be able to truly grieve me and move on with her life. Yes there will be pain, but there won't be the type of pain that comes from your father committing suicide or a father that was pushed out by the mother and made to look like they don't care about you at all. Except a part of me would want to leave her a letter so she knows just how much I care about her and why I really did it. Except that would mean I would have to include someone I trusted to keep it secret and only give it to her if she ever came asking for questions. I feel so self even wanting to do that because of all the unexpected pain that would cause.  


Has everyone ever thought about staging your suicide to look like an accident?",1
"Suicide thoughts are back in townThe thoughts are crawling back, I'm too tense to sleep, too tired to do anything, I want to cry and throw up at the same time. I feel guilty even though I haven't done anything wrong, and I feel sad and powerless.

Something good finally happens to me, and my mother decides to crush it, she starts making up things, even I am doubting of whether this thing that makes me happy is good.

And I feel so tense, my head and body hurts, once again I wish I could end it all. I wish I could not exist.",1

I haven't even gotten out of bed yet today. I think my relapse was caused from my great aunt calling me today and bringing back terrible, terrible memories from when my mom tried to commit suicide, because my dad had been so abusive to her and me and my sisters my whole life. She was saying she doesn't like my mom or understand her and that my eldest sister (who is a sweetheart) is a bad person etc. etc. 
I just really need someone to talk to so I can through today and wake up ok tomorrow, because I know if I don't talk to anyone today, I will get worse by tonight and become suicidal again.",1

"It's not an option.....but I keep turning to the idea again and again. I've had almost twenty years where I have considered suicide as an option. I've just started to try to take it off the table but the idea persists. I'm thinking about it right now...I'm not depressed...I'm intensely anxious, I'm trying to calm myself, to pull out of it, but one calming thought isn't a thought I should be entertaining - I can quit if things are bad. 

I don't WANT to be thinking this. I know it shouldn't be an option. I know what I have to do if I start going for the optionless option. 

I am calming a little but not really...I'm dissociating. ",1
"I can't believe how cruel life isWow.

I always knew devastation and despair exists. Natural disasters, murder, rape, all kinds of horrors.

But the realisation keeps sinking in.

The older I get the harder it is to cope.

I regularly have casual suicidal ideation. I wouldn't do it now because I don't want to hurt my family. But I just feel like my emotional pain threshold is so small. Even when things are ok I find it hard to find the will or interest in living. So when the inevitable happens I have no idea how I would be able to find the will to go on.",1

"Hopeless Turns HilariousSo, my area has an ""Emotional Support Line"" here in Chicago IL.

I said it was online. She said ""I'm not online.""

"Suicidal thoughts?I'm thinking this is an appropriate place to post this, but please notify if it isn't. 

If I have detailed plans of suicide, such as:
1. Excusing myself to go to the nurse's office in order to get some medicine at around 11.25 am (theoretically the least crowded time) when a lax teacher is supervising, leaving all my precious belongings on the table and then going through the back stairs, after which I'd loop around and go to the windows open on the second floor, climbing off said window and jumping to my death, making sure that I'm falling head-first

Or

2. Going to the rooftop of the building by firstly turning the handle to the right, then pushing the window 15 minutes before others would crowd in, proceeding to then find a surface to step on before falling to my death, ensuring that I'm falling head-first

Should I seek professional help, even though I would not be courageous enough to do it because I am afraid of heights?

"It seems like the only option leftI guess the main reason I haven't offed myself yet is because I haven't yet found a painless and easily accessible way of doing it. At this point, I neither enjoy nor have an interest in life. I don't feel like working, studying, socializing, playing games, nothing. I come from a family with a history of depression and mental illness. My parents are no exception, which is why I've had to distance myself from them just to remain sane. 

I've always considered myself to be different from everyone, even as a kid. I would spend a lot of time in a fantasy world rather than reality.

I no longer see the point in studying or getting a degree. All I want to do is sit here all day and be as passive and useless as possible. Medicines make me functional, but they don't allow me to enjoy life or even remotely connect with anyone. There is no place for me in the world.  ",1

Live to be happy. That is what they say. 

Can you be happy alone? If you cannot be happy alone, then you must find someone that supplements your happiness. But that requires a person that isn't a fucking shit-ass, which is everyone. This route requires that I rely on someone, and for mine own happiness, shouldn't I provide that for myself? --&gt;

If I can be happy alone, why? What will I do with my happiness? Kick sand in the sea? Go climb a tree? Purposely hurt myself to check that pain still registers in my brain? Then what, go to sleep and wake up the next day for the exact same thing? 


What's the difference? What's the point? Why was I born? If the answer is ""you define your own purpose"", well then I'd like to sign up for being a vegetable, in a coma. My purpose at that point would be giving other people purpose in their pointless little lives. They have to keep me alive until someone says kill him! And then I die, and then I'm free. I then no longer exist, and my mind will be at ease because there will be nothing else.

"I hate being weak.I hate being weak. I want to be strong. I know what it takes to be strong, but I don't have the energy. 

I'm happiest when I wake up and have a cup of coffee, then after an hour or two my energy drops and I feel like there's no way to make my situation better.

I'm currently only part time employed. I work in a very small company cleaning houses that have been left in disarray before they go back on the market. I need the money, my bank statements are in the negative, but the work hurts and I dread going back. I'm not strong enough for it.

People tell me I'm smart, but I feel like the way I think or look at things hurts me. I know there's more beyond our universe, but it isn't God. Reality isn't theatrical. Everything is a perception of our brains, there is no soul.

I live in a ghetto, and I don't have friends that understand me or the way I think. Using big words is impressive to them and selling drugs is their idea of nobility. I want to go to college, but I don't even have money for a car. 

I want to learn how to drive, but nobody can teach me for free and I'm afraid. I'm a nervous driver because I understand what is happening. A several hundred pound vehicle is going very fast. I'm afraid of hurting people. 

I like and hate drugs. They're my only escape, but they only make me worse. I stopped taking them but now I want them again. 

When I was a child my parents put me on medication because I was too rowdy. I hate them now, even though they try to be nice to me. I think that's what caused the chemical imbalance in my brain, and I hate them so much for it. 

I use to be really fat and bullied in highschool. I wanted to kill myself several times but was too afraid. That feeling of being afraid is almost completely gone now.

I'm not fat anymore cause when I moved out of my parent's I decided I could just starve myself. It wouldn't take any effort and I'd be skinny. Now I am, I'm even called handsome all the time, but I don't feel like I worked for it. I still feel fat and gross on the inside, no matter what people tell me.

I want to love someone, but I'm afraid of opening up. I was only loved by someone once in my life, and that relationship is gone because of the way I was as a teenager. I don't think I deserve love. I'm a burden and offer nothing but problems, I wouldn't want to impose that on someone I cared for. 

I'm so tired, all the time. My thoughts race so I need to distract myself, all the time. I like going for walks and listening to audiobooks, that's the only way I can really distract myself long enough to relax. I liked listening to audiobooks at the gym too, but I can't anymore because my job hurts my body so much. 

I'm 22 and only just barely graduated highschool because I hated going so much. I've never had a job I can be proud of and I feel like I've already proven I won't become anything.

My most comforting thoughts are of suicide. I'd like to OD. I wouldn't mind dying at my happiest point. I wouldn't have to hurt my friends with the knowledge I wanted to kill myself either. They'd just think I was reckless. 

I want to cry but I don't think I can anymore. I want help but no one should have to burden themselves with me. I want to help but I don't think I'm good enough to do so. ",1

"I Can't Do Anything Right and It's Too Late to Fix Anything NowI've basically been a failure most of my life.

"A few ""almosts"", never pulled through. Decided to give this a shot.I'm an early 20's student with, what I believe is, nothing left to live for. I don't see me actually living past the year, and never have done for a while. Suicidal thoughts are always there, ways I can do it and how I could stop myself.

I know it's very unhelpful to say this, but ""I've been through a lot"". I won't go into detail, but I'm now 100 percent certain that lives would be better off in the long term without me existing.

I have no redeeming qualities about myself. Whenever I try to fix something, it ends up more broken, whenever I'm sure there is something positive about myself, it's either taken away or exposed as something negative. Of course my family would be saddened by my passing, and I love them dearly, but honest, my death seems like a huge benefit to them in the long term. They don't even cross my mind when I try and commit suicide, in those cloudy hazes when I think ""This is it"".

I've never told anyone about my thoughts or that on more than one occasion I've been one swift movement from my death. Thrice it's happened, things that I've thought could have ended it. From jumping off of things, to drinking things I shouldn't. 

Suicide seems so simple. It's not even a case of ""Will I, won't I"", it's just a case of ""when"". It's inevitable and unavoidable. Sometime this year, maybe even this week, I might end up doing it. The only thing that pulls be out of these ""almost"" situation isn't even emotional. It's just that I want to do it alone.",1

"This is driving me fucking insane.One minute, I'm fine.

Then I realize that at this very second, my wife is probably slobbering all over some guy's nasty, disease-ridden prick on the other side of my world. Or he's slapping her ass, and she's begging for more. Or they just finished and now they've cuddled each other into a stupor whispering sweet nothings into each other's ears. Am I jealous? You fucking bet.

I don't want to be separated. I don't want this to continue. I want to be with her again. I want her to be mine again. Marital separation is driving me to the brink of human sanity and mortality. I have no idea what to do with myself late at night, because I can think of nothing else but how badly I want to be laying with her in bed, falling asleep with my arms wrapped around her, like we used to. Hell, I'll be happy with even a simple promise that she'll come back, that she'll love me. Or to end the separation by saying 'I love you' to each other, and staying faithful until she's done with school where she's at or something. I just want her heart again.

The worst part is this entire charade is MY fault. I don't even know what happened. For some reason I wanted to divorce her, but I'm not sure why. I somehow got her to agree to separation, once she was living a few states over; she made no explicit promises of ever returning to me, though. I wasn't abusive. I don't... I don't think I was mean. I honestly think I had a fit of mental psychosis or depression or something, because the details of the whole ordeal are so fuzzy and distant that I can't even tell what's fact or fiction. It feels like I hit my head really hard on something and forgot a month or two of my life. Because I don't remember jack shit.

But I'm so incredibly, unfathomably terrified that I will never, ever get to see her or hold her again, whether from her own choice or from her getting in some kind of accident (killed in a wreck, raped, whatever) that it's driving me absolutely mad. My regret is so intangible and so indescribable - I have never felt so fucking stupid and so wronged by myself at all in my entire life. I fucked this up. I caused all of this.

I have never experienced anything in my life that feels as purely and completely fucking WRONG as this entire situation. It feels like an absolute perversion of reality. It doesn't even feel like it's actually fucking happening AT ALL sometimes. I catch myself coming home from work at night and looking in the kitchen to see if she's in there concocting some new culinary experiment to subject me to.

I have a hard time being optimistic because she's a mechanical, calculating, logical thinker. For her to come back, there would have to be some sort of gain for her existence, something to help her. But I feel like I don't offer her anything of value. I am an imaginary number in her equation. And I have no idea how to turn myself into something that will be of benefit to her - she thinks of things like business contracts it seems. If I want her to come back, there has to be something in it for her. Or at least that's how it seems. I'm probably just freaking out. I know she wants an assertive, dominant, masculine male who isn't afraid of social situations and who stands up for himself and is proud of who he is. I don't know how to do that.

 The pure pain that wracks my heart and my gut is enough that it makes me want to just fucking end it all. It hurts too much. I can't focus on anything at all. I'm a fumbling moron at work, I don't have any drive or energy or focus to do anything basic that needs to be done at home. I've tried tricking and fooling myself into believing that I'm okay, that it'll all be fine... but I can't do this anymore. Maybe if I end it, I'll wake up and I'll come back into reality, where none of this happened in the first place. I don't know of any other way to show her just how truly deep my regret is, and how much I love her.",1

"Just gonna rambleI never felt suicidal until the summer of 2015. After I was sexually assaulted I was convinced I had HIV (I had mono three weeks later which mimics the symptoms of seroconversion exactly). I hated myself for putting myself in a position that could wreck my life. I quit seeing my family and going to train martial arts because I was scared I would accidentally infect someone (you're most infectious the first 6 weeks).

After looking up the cost and terrible side affects of the HIV meds, I realized I could never burden someone with a relationship if I was positive. So I broke it off with the guy I was falling for and decided if I was positive suicude was the only option. This horrified me because I loved being alive and my self hatred reached new levels, since I blamed myself for what happened. 

I cried all day every day for weeks alone. I tried going to a few clinics for help but they were only interested in helping homosexuals psychologically. I was too afraid and ashamed to report the assault for many reasons so I didn't get help.

After I finally tested definitely negative I thought I would feel relieved and grateful. But nothing got better. Ive been alone and unable to function since. A lot of really horrible things also happened to me in mental hospitals and stuff. I lost my dog and the abusive guy I dated stole over 10k from me.

At some point I fixated on suicide again. The constant fear of death was gone and the PTSD lifted. I stopped having panic attacks and nightmares. But if I start feeling a desire to live again, I am overwhelmed with grief, terror and grief at everything I have lost and how evil some people are. I feel like if I ever found a smidgen of happiness it will be taken from me or used against me. The person I was a year ago gone. I'm not a person anymore. I've been dead for a very long time already.",1

Now my 6+ years girlfriend is ending it with me for no ""real"" reason, she just don't feel like dating anymore. I can understand her, but it's very hard not to have anything to blame or to see as a reason to it ending, I've been the best boyfriend I could be for the entire time, in all senses, and now I see it going away. I have 24yo now, and I've been in this relationship for my entire adult life. I ain't a person outside of it. 

And now everything I had is getting so much worst because of this, I can't even try to get better since I can't focus on anything at all, even the stuff I use to procrastinate and kill time don't distract me anymore. I can't find anything to hold on to, and suicide is getting more and more real as a alternative.

"Just need some mental help here... Not sure how to go on.So i've dealt with depression for a very long time. Nothing too severe the majority of the time, but sometimes it just spikes and I get happy at the thought of not having to deal with... Life. You know?


I got laid off at the beginning of december, after having a shitty paycheck for taking a week off due to being sick, and as you can imagine I've run out of money. I've had $0.46 in my bank account for around a week and a half now, after having to pay for a traffic ticket that wasn't really my fault (That's what they all say) and I'm living off of one box of brown rice I found in the back of my pantry.


I thought I had found a job that could get me through until I found a real one, and I was elated, but it turned out to basically be a scam. I've made a grand total of $25 for 15+ hours of work, and I wont even be getting that for another week. So you can imagine, going from elated to absolutely crushed has ruined me both mentally and physically. I don't think I left my room today other than going to the bathroom. It's 1:26 and I haven't even had a drink today.

And to top all of this off, Apparently Hulu can overdraft my bank account even though I told chase, when explicitly asked, to *NEVER* let my account be overdrawn. So now my bank balance is -$7.53. And I'll be charged a $34 fee for that, which I wont be able to pay, because I've only made $25 dollars. So there's *another* fee on top because of that that I won't be able to pay. And on and on and on...


Added to this the fact that if I want a *""real""* job at any point in the near future I need to go through college, getting myself further into debt, even though I don't even know what I want to do for a career anymore. 


I just don't see the actual point of being alive, when all I am is unhappy, or happy but *waiting* for a problem to present itself. What do? Help.",1

Basically, I get really depressed (but not suicidal) when I don't see other kids for even a couple of days. This is bad because I just left school, and I don't have enough friends to constantly see them, and I don't have any siblings.

I cannot find any other way to make myself feel good. When I have fun playing video games, I miss out on the rest of life, and end up crying in my bed when I am done.

"Feeling useless and suicidal after doing something goodToday was supposed to be a wonderful day. I got my driving license on my first try thanks to all the effort and support received from my loved ones. I felt so overwhelmed with joy that it felt like i could explode.

But the feeling lasted very few hours. I'd say minutes.

I feel empty. I just want to cry and die. Even though I surpassed all my expectations with the driving issue, it feels like that was just what I was supposed to do, and anything less than than would be shameful -this meaning, there was no reason to be happy to begin with. I think that all this time I was just trying to suppress these feelings only to achieve what I was supposed to, and now, there's nothing to do.

I stopped talking with so many people only to stay focused. This feels so much like a relapse, but this time it's going full speed. Feels as if i wanted to postpone my suicide, using the driving subject as an excuse.",1

I am sitting here in my room alone and the only thing I can think about is ending it. I feel tired, and for several reasons


 I haven't been happy in my life for a couple years now since a bad break up with a girlfriend who I loved very much. It dealt a huge blow to my confidence and emotions. Since then i've had a tough time being secure in who I am. This has caused problems in relationships i've had since.  I don't even try anymore. 

 I grew up being placed in the Gifted and Talented classes being told I was extremely smart, reaching genius levels. I have never felt like I can never live up to what is expected of me. I sit and watch myself fail, not because i'm not smart, but because of my own self destructiveness. 

I feel like I am losing my friends, I rarely talk to my best ones and it seems like the only time any of them wants to spend time together with me is when other people are there to drink. This is coupled with that I kissed on of my best friends accidental while we were drunk new years eve and we haven't talked since. 

I'm just so very very tired, I want to escape it all and be free from all of this. ",1

"slowly giving upi know no one will read this but i guess i just need to take this out of my chest.

i've been lonely pretty much my entire life, the few friends i've made so far gave upon me and for the past 3 months i had no real connection with anyone.

i live in a very toxic environment and my family is not really a reason to keep fighting for my life anymore.

i've made this account as a last attempt to meet someone but i had almost no success, i tried sending as many messages as possible to as many people as i could and all i got in return was being left on read or superficial talk. i don't know if i'm giving the wrong impression or something, or maybe i'm trying too hard? i guess i'm the kind of person who puts heart and soul into everything i do.

i can't help but thinking that i am the problem and honestly the only solution i can think about is to attempt suicide again.

anyways that's my rant for today i just hope i can go through this night.

all my love,

"Guys, I really need your advice.I'll get straight to the point. One of my best friends self harms on a regular basis, and has suicidal tendencies. We're the only source of support for one another at the moment, so I want to do anything I can to help her. However, she's a very closed off person in general, and it's very hard to get her to open up to me. Her self harm is pretty serious, and a lot of times it gets out of hand too. Tonight was one of those nights. She texted me freaking out, and then immediately closed off saying that everything is fine and she's okay. She refuses to admit that this is a serious problem, and I find that very worrisome. I want her to talk to me abt it, because I know talking has helped me sometimes, but I am also aware that it may not be helpful for everyone. However I do feel like her denial to admit the danger she poses to herself is very harmful, and it scares me. Despite being someone who is going through the same problem, I'm still at a loss for what to do. Should I continue pressing her to talk to me? I want to wait for her to come to me when she's ready but I know her and I know that if I don't start the conversation then it will never take place. And I don't think her ignoring the depth of the situation is doing her any favors. I don't  know what to do. I would really appreciate some advice on this matter.

"Can’t deal with it any moreI have personally had problems with depression and anxiety for about 4 years now and I thought I had got over them about a year ago. I recently started a 6 week field course in another country that I have to do for my university studies and throughout the problems have gotten progressively worse to the point where I am now very suicidal, after being given work that the uni didn’t check the difficulty of and yet expected me to get on with. About a week ago I contacted the university to see if I could come home because the problems are so bad and they said I have to stay or else I fail my degree. I have stayed on around a week now and the depression and anxiety have progressed from terrible to unbearable and I can’t go on. I have started making plans to end my life on my way home at a stop off between where I am and home at a hotel because I have failed to do anything and my family probably won’t support me, nor my uni, if I ask to repeat the year/ fieldwork. I have failed at everything I have ever set out to do and I can’t deal with any more problems. Does anyone have any advice as to what I should do to stop feeling like this and making these plans.",1
"When I was a little kid, I promise I'll die onI'll die on the happiest day of my life. I remember suicide is such a common thing in my home town. Dying naturally be it accident or desease is too depressing. So I say if I don't get to choose when or why I was born, I should at least choose when I can die. And I will show people that dying shouldn't just be a""way out"". People should not die unhappy. So I promised myself I'll get everything I want and will die at the high point of my life. 

I think I just got there. I'm on antidepressants. I have a good job. I just bought a condo. I think I'm ready. I never did enjoy life much still. And I'm wasting so much resources, resource that could've gone to people who actually like life. And I don't want to just die. I want to spent my life. I want to donate all my organs. If I were to die to capital punishment, I want to commit a crime that is of my Life's worth, whatever it is. I thought about it a lot. If I find a clinic in Mexico, I don't think my organs will go fairly to people that needs it. I don't want them to go to the highest bidder. Maybe Netherland can be my best bet. I don't know how to get a doctor to help me with such what seem silly idea. But I know I'm just a Google away from the answer.

"I'm scared to feel happySometimes I wake up, lay in bed and just think I want to die then spend the next couple of hours thinking about how to do so. Sometimes I wake up and feel a little hope. And sometimes I wake up and I can’t help but think of last nights nightmare. My dreams are so uncomfortable and horribly vivid. They’re so vivid that I think about my dreams through out the whole day because they’re so uncomfortably real that I feel like it happened… Anyways throughout the whole day I’m just an emotional roller coaster I’m fine, I’m sad, I’m crazy, I’m hopeful (this is rare), I’m sane, I’m insane, I’m nothing, and I feel nothing. The times I feel happy or hope I get scared. I’m scared of getting too happy then falling back down into my deep depression. It’s false hope that I’m setting up for myself. I recently left college after my first semester because I couldn’t cope with my depression. Everyone tells me that I need to get mentally better before I make decisions, but I can’t help but think about my future and what I’m going to do next. My mind is constantly running and thinking. Even when I have nothing to think about I realize that a song is playing in my head. I inevitably think about going back to college and even research some new colleges to attend, but then I just get so scared all of a sudden and I feel pathetic and bad for myself. I then flashback to the person I was earlier this year. I was excited for college, my depression was controllable, and I was on the right track, everything was fine! I just want to be that person again. How did I end up like this? How did I change myself without my consent, without my knowledge? I had my life in control and now I have no control. I was certain about my future and now I have no certainty at all. So this is why I’m scared to feel happy. I’m scared to get better because I know that my depression will come back. I don’t want to stay on this roller coaster. I want to get off. I NEED to get off. For my sanity. I beg God to push me off of this roller coaster. I’ve been fighting so hard to control my depression and I’ve had my successes and failures. But I don’t want to keep fighting. I don’t want to try anymore. I feel like I cant. I’m currently on three anti-depressants and I can feel them working. I can feel parts of me dying because of the medication I’m on. I don’t want them to work, I don’t want to get better because I just don’t want to do this anymore. I can’t cry anymore, I can’t feel my emotions flow out of me through my tears. I loved crying, I loved releasing my sadness and I can’t anymore. I feel INSANE. I feel like somethings wrong in my body. Why can’t I cry? I feel sad all the time, but I don’t know why. I feel stuck in this world. I feel stuck in my mind and body. I want to break out and be free. Aren’t people supposed to love life? Aren’t people supposed to want to live? I don’t want to live another day. I just want everything to end so I can finally be free.

"Need advice, I can't sleep at nightTo begin with, I'd like to mention that this is not common insomnia. I was struggling with lots of anxiety and panic attacks before, but since quarantine began they became more frequent than what i can handle. 
Each night is the same, i try to go to sleep but falling asleep feels like dying (no joke). I get tachycardia, palpitations, my arms feel numb, I can't breathe properly, low blood pressure (some of them heart attack symptoms, yet i did a lot of medical studies and I'm perfectly fine. All doctors said it was something related to stress and anxiety). 
I went to therapy for the first time on January, wishing i could fix myself. Everything was going well but quarantine got me not only stuck but even worse than i ever was. My therapist said there's actually no actual way for me to feel better while being in this situation, i need to go out with my friends and make my surroundings more possitive, yet I can't. 
I don't know what to do to feel better, if someone has any advice on how to calm myself down, stop feeling like all these symptoms are real and get to sleep it'll make me really happy. Thanks in advance and hope you all have a great day!!",1
"I have everything readyI have the alcohol. I have 114 high dose pills of a medication that ""should not be prescribed to a patient at risk for self harm"". I lied to the walk-in doctor and feigned a condition that I do not have to get them. They're so pretty and I love them. 

I want to talk about it with my therapist but I want it to be a decision I make myself. If I tell her that I have these prescription medications, she'll probably have to call the police. I can't tell anyone. Everyone hates me and I am nothing but a burden. I don't want to go on inpatient again. I'm going to throw my SIM card off of the balcony so I cannot call anyone when my survival instinct kicks in. I know that most overdoses do not work but my biggest one got me intubated and that was with an OTC. 

I don't want to bide time anymore.

"Tired of living but scared of dyingI’ve had a rough couple of years and I’m exhausted. It’s 1 step forward and 20 steps back. I am trying so hard but can’t seem to ever move forward. The only thing that makes me happy is sleeping and staying home just relaxing, knitting, or watching tv. My best friend passed away last year and it really fucked with me. I never thought about death so much until then. I want to have everything stop and just get a break. I want to have this end but I’m scared of what’s to come once it ends. I’m not a religious person and don’t know what I believe happens to us after we are gone. I think what I fear is who has to find me. I don’t want my family to have to see me like that and have always said that I want to be cremated and not put on display. 

I fear leaving my husband behind. He has been my rock and I seriously don’t know what I’d do without him. I fear for the pain that will get left behind because I want my pain to end. 

I wish there was a simpler way out. Leave behind no pain for others, no one to miss me, no one to grieve over me. I want to stop my own pain but don’t want to inflict pain on others in the process. I’m at a loss for words and don’t know where to go",1

I want to die but I won't kill myself, all this pain that I've gone through would be for nothing. I one day would like to be a spokesman for mental health. I want to start an organization one day called ""Fighting Mental Illness With Friends"". So many people are hurting inside and wish they all knew they're not alone. I wish I could take everybody's pain away. I will help people one day though. All of this pain wasn't for nothing.  ",1

"Frankly, I don't know what to do anymoreI've been thinking about death, about killing myself. A lot. So many different methods, brainstorming and thinking of which one would be most efficient and work best for me. I've decided that my best way to go would be overdosing on Benadryl, possibly getting drunk beforehand, fastening a bag on my head and hoping that I'm unconscious when I run out of air. I dream of it, imagine it, it's like it haunts me while still being some kind of twisted fantasy. 
I know why I'm so fucked up. I've been in therapy for almost 3 years, which has made a miniature dent in the issues I have. Here's a bit of backstory.
First off, my dad abandoned my mother and I before I was born. Things weren't bad yet but this will play an important part later in life. 
My mom met my now ex-stepdad when I was 3 or 4. He was really nice at first, treating me like his own daughter. After my brother was born and I grew older, he changed drastically. I don't want to go into too much detail but let's just say years 7-15 were a mix of emotional, physical, and sexual abuse. My father died when I was 10 and he did his best to beat the tears out of me.
When I was 15, I got the courage and support to  report him. Went to trial 2 years later, he was slapped with 74 years in prison. If you have the right keywords, there are plenty of articles that can detail what went on.

I still haven't recovered from all that. They say actually holding them accountable and standing up to your abuser strengthens you and helps you heal. For me, I just feel weaker and weaker. I tried killing myself over a fucking guy like four months ago. 
I'm trying my best to get better but I'm so fucking done. I feel my mental health crumbling more and more every single day. I've been diagnosed with a chronic condition and live every day in pain. I'm so ready to give up, I have the materials, I have notes written to those I love. I fear that I'm just annoying if I reach out too often, so I'm near giving up on that too.

I'm sorry for the long post, I've been losing it more and more recently and I just don't really care for my future anymore.

"I need help...This isn't my first Reddit post, but I'm using a throwaway account because if this comes back to me it will have implications. I'm going to have to be vague in some areas because I'm terrified that someone I know will see this and know who it is. 

Anyway, I've been miserable for years now. I graduated and got the job I wanted, but aside from that I've made no progress in my life. I'm in my 20s. I've never had a girlfriend. I've made a few friends along the way, but they've all just drifted away, probably in no small part because I'm crap at social interaction, but probably not helped by the fact that I move with my job every year or so at the moment, and I don't get a lot of choice in that matter. 

I have nobody. I mean, literally nobody. If you asked me to name a friend, I'd draw a blank. When I had to sign my tenancy, I didn't even have anyone who could countersign aside from my family. If I go through my last called phone numbers, I have my parents, a list of cold callers and a few people from work who I phoned purely to discuss business. I don't have any plans when I'm not at work. I don't leave the house, I don't go anywhere. I sometimes go and visit my family at the weekend (a few hundred miles away) but even then I'm just hanging out with them rather than meeting any friends from home. I've had one night out in the last two years with work colleagues, which has been the totality of my social life in that time. 

I've tried to get out there, but I've ended up becoming more and more of a recluse. I can barely interact with any business without ending up lodging a complaint, and I'm getting sick and tired of having to deal with crap customer service and people blaming me for their mistakes. I'm getting terrified of speaking to people in general as a result of this. 

This has been my life for a few years, and usually I can cover this up by saying that work is my raison d'être. I usually enjoy my work and rely on that to get through my life. But now work's collapsed around me as well (and this is where I have to be especially vague). There's been an incident at work that I've been involved in, and it's big. My bosses are telling me that I'm not to blame, but I'm sure they'll throw me under the bus if they have the opportunity to do so to save their own backsides. I recently found out that they did try and do this to me a few months ago (and failed), and I wasn't aware of it until well after it had been wrapped up. I don't really trust anyone now. 

It's taken me a long time to post this, because every time I try and open up to people I get called every name under the sun. It's all my fault that I'm in this situation, I appreciate that. I'm a pushover, I'm a wimp, and I'm an absolute cunt of a person. I know this now. This is the life I have chosen. But I'm still fucking terrified, because I have a plan for suicide. It's not an easy plan, and of course I'm not going to share it with anyone in case I give anyone any ideas. But it's a plan I came up with on Saturday night and one that is achievable. And that's closer than I've ever been before. I've had brief thoughts about driving into oncoming cars and throwing myself in front of trains and other stupid shit like that, but they've always been brief thoughts lasting seconds. I've never actually thought something through to this extent. 

I don't have anywhere to turn to. Family are too far away and they'll just get upset and blame me. I have no friends, as I've already said. If I go through work it'll become a big thing that will impede or even end my career and give me less of a reason to live. I'll never get an appointment with a doctor, and they'll probably just put me back on fluoxetine which didn't really do anything last time I had it (I just weaned myself off it several years ago). 

I'm sorry to have just poured out, but I need to write this somewhere. ",1
"última nota (last note)I have left this writing to express the reasons that have led me to make this decision. Things that no one can confess or that if they were to confess will not be taken seriously and would be mocked. It is not something that has emerged in a matter of months, much less days. This I have been able to feel little by little, even see and feel, since I began to have a little judgment.

Life always seemed mysterious to me, it is something that defies the infinite uncertainty of things; it is a ray of light in the immense darkness. This situation is not entirely graceful, in fact it soon becomes quite miserable. The individual challenge always ends up being useless with the looming of death, but life itself, as a whole, persists in vain. The course of life seemed futile, inert and bland. A vicious circle that aims to continue life itself through generations. Everything that is done daily, unconsciously fulfills a purpose that obeys life, its perpetuity. Soon I was immersed in rot and ""spiritual"" misery.

Not everyone can perpetuate it, in fact, nature has developed different mechanisms in each species that ensure that those that continue it are those that possess (genetic) characteristics that meet the needs that life demands of them, in order to avoid the annihilation of the species and being able to obey the will of life. Those who do not comply are ruthlessly discarded. As if his existence had represented a simple error, worthy of a spit. They are here only to experience rejection and misery. The worst corresponds to them almost as a right. If they were to make the mistake of recklessly breeding offspring, they would also fall into misery except for a few rare cases. 

In the end our purpose in this world is only a valid one. The one to reproduce. Everything else lies in the human imagination that paradoxically was given to us as a tool for survival but that, through the years, acquired other uses that mock life itself. Becoming an artist, for example. By the way, I want to say that there have been characters who have transcended all this crap and have been able to see beyond this torment. They are truly wise and reach unimaginable confines for the average subject. These subjects are rare and not all enjoy such a release. All the rest of us obey the will to live, sublime and omnipresent.

My consciousness was realizing this foolish matter. I also became aware of my shortcomings and about the place I occupy on this earth. Everything I did on a daily basis was acquiring a bitter taste. Nothing that used to bring me joy does it anymore. The only moments that bring me peace, even if only for a few seconds, is to listen to a piece of art, sometimes the evening cloudscape, some tree frolicking to the rhythm of the wind, the song of the birds and the sky, with its clouds by the day and stars at night. Nature so ruthless is also giver of the most beautiful events that my senses can perceive, even so, despair makes none of this achieve comfort me anymore.

It's funny to hear well-adjusted people talk about their false morals, slapstick such as: beauty is subjective, we are all smart in our own way, God loves us all and has a purpose for us all, etc. The hypocrisy is so obvious and its irony sickens me. It is repeated so much that it is socially wrong to deny such statements when in reality their rejection and their passive contempt for people inferior to them is evident.

This world turned out to be absurd, insignificant and full of bestiality, in the end we are only animals, and just as the weak and maladjusted animal is abandoned and left to die, the human does exactly the same, but tries to justify it with facades and false statements about why we should not do it, when in reality it is done in a subtle and passive way. Christianity represents a false refuge, comforts and gives false hope to the miserable condition of life. This world is not for us.

Personally I have failed and I have been discarded, in this life all I can experience is failure, alienation and pain. My mental abilities are weak. I am not strong, cunning, and much less attractive to my kind. Biologically there is no purpose that I can fulfill. I have stopped moving, if I ever moved forward. Nature has done with me what it should do. My mental faculties have been declining. In this state there is nothing I can experience other than suffering. And I am almost sure that there is no way out of this abyss. It is evident that something inside me no longer works or never worked. I never knew at what moment I began to descend into this deep abyss. Totally unable to modify it, my mind has become a place where desolation and hopelessness dominate in perpetuity. If I can find something to entertain myself it will always be for the benefit of those who are very well adapted to life's struggles. There are people who abandon their worth by giving up their servitude. I am one of those people. I am not able to conquer myself or my environment. There is nothing for me in this world.",1

"after overcoming severe depression my way of life has come around full circle to a dark place once again.Looking though this subreddit is vary sad, People pouring their souls out to strangers in return for a few upvotes and a comment or two extending pointless sympathy. Even though it dosn't matter here's my story

to put it bluntly, my parents had brainwashed my view of life so deeply that if you don't have a high paying job your going to be unhappy for the rest of your life. at the age of 5 I can then recite that i want to be an engineer when i grow up, not even knowing what that was. Fast track to highschool where pressure and depression is at an all time high. If you dont do well here, you wont get into a good school and if that doesnt happen then your going to make pennies and hate your life forever.

everyday i would get what I now know of as ""suicide headaches"", a burning skull shattering pain in the back of my head every time i would feel depressed and thought of suicide making it 1000 times worse, my time in school would be replaced with finding out the best way to kill myself. my grades dropped and my social life suffered. 

The only way i overcame suicide was to take on dont give a fuck attitude to everything in my life, I felt beyond relieved, I felt confident, I felt happy.. knowing in the back of my mind that I'll just ride this life out until I actually am unhappy and do hate my life... 4years later after getting into a shitty school and getting a shitty ""engineering technologist"" degree in a field that I hate, I get rejected from all universities and the thought of ever building/desiging/creating something to help others or the world is shattered

I'm in debt, Time is passing by, I can only enter a field I hate and i don't have enough time or money to pursue another career path that would make me even less wealthy

maybe this is a sad pathetic reason to be depressed but I know this feels like a disease that will never be able to shake.. all my life I knew the way I'd die was by suicide... maybe not now.. maybe after I've won this battle but later I know i'll loose the war

"I have no meaningful relationships/life isn't for everyoneDon't assume I'm lazty/shy and tell me to put myself out there; I do that already.

Don't assume in some some disgusting entitled low life person; I don't demand/people be my friend etc. Its hard to judge your own character but I certainly try hard to be a good person.

I'm not trying to blame others. But it seems the person who I've become has no proper place in my society. I can think of one solution

Don't tell me things get better; they have and I still end up the same
Don't tell me it's a phase; this is nonstop from 11, just shy of half my life I'm like this
Don't tell me I'm not thinking straight; I've spent countless hours in my head over this

Even at times when I feel some fulfilment, feel love from a large group of good friends girlfriends and family, feel in touch with nature, I still want to die

Don't call me selfish, I've come very close to ending it all before. There was a period where I was only staying alive to keep others from being devastated. Even still, why can't I be allowed to die. Living is pain, those who claim they'll be sad are only adding to the pain, I didn't ask to be born

I very so desire to slide a knife through my neck a few times and then experience my last few minutes in pure bliss

I don't know if I want an afterlife, to be mentally/spiritually non-existant and completely gone from the void is better than what I have. Any heaven would be hell if the way I am doesn't drastically change in the spiritual passing process

Being happy shouldn't be too much to ask : (

"she took all the money. how do I talk to my mom?Another day another chapter. 

I want everyone to know I sat down with my dad today and **I now have a place to live** in a month. He surprised me, actually; I was just about to step off to go to the bar down the road to drown my misery and he happened to stop by with hubby's tax returns. 

We talked about my situation (see previous posts). He told me that he had already set up a place in his new home for me &amp; the ratties to stay. So I will not be living/camping in my car! When I asked about my brother, I was told his work had been extended again and he will be out of town for several months. Plenty of time for us to set up accommodations if I'm still at home being a loser of a daughter and Brother has to come back.

I mentioned to my dad that the dog will need to see the vet, the tumour on his abdomen is now causing him some discomfort. My dad got upset and told me he couldn't afford it. Then I found out:

My cunt of a mother. She followed through on her threats and went after the full alimony while keeping her personal savings. Now my Father will spend the rest of his life financially supporting his useless ex-wife while she flaunts around with whatever fuck toy she has that week to go drinking with. My mother only works a few hours a week to pay for her wine habit. She justified the full amount because she 'deserves it and that is only fair'. Bitch you weren't even a SAHM we were fucking latchkey kids!

After my dad left it took every ounce of strength to not pull up Facebook and post a 'Congratulations on stealing Dad's money, have fun banging fucktoy on your next vacation. You lost your daughter.' on her public wall and letting the shitstorm play out. Her side of the family doesn't know what she has done yet. Her co-workers think she is still with my dad. I considered sending an angry private message to her over Facebook but it was so vile and bitter I deleted it out of shame. Despite what she has done she *is* my mother and I need to be the better person here and deal with this like an adult.

Tomorrow I have to call the bank to set up an appointment for my accounts to be adjusted. Mom still has access to my main banking account and she has now lost that privilege upon this news. And next month when the house sale goes through there is going to be some hefty change in that piggy bank. How can I trust she won't be drunk and decide to dip into her daughter's savings? Or that fucktoy won't swindle her into taking some extra cash? He is a salesman and he is sleeeeeezy. I don't doubt his hands have been at play in the alimony fight. 

I don't know who she is any more. My mother was my role model and my guide through life. I wanted to be her, and now this has happened. I want nothing from this woman now. How could she do that to my father? he loved her so much. he slaved for so many years so they could have a good retirement. was this her plan all along? is she a narcissist playing the long con or is she really just mentally ill? she won't open up about it. attempts to communicate to her that we (myself, dad, brother, my hubby, and her old friends) are extremely concerned about her well-being and health ends in her usual screaming and anger fits that she is a grown woman and this is not our business. It is at the point where I feel only she can help herself. I have tried so damn hard. So many calls and referrals and sit downs and talking to try to get her to open up, just a little, tell me or a therapist or SOMEONE what is going through her head. I've given her many tools and resources. She won't touch a one. Yet she sees me struggle day by day just trying to find a reason to not finally jump off the bridge.

This has to get off my chest and I need to talk to her. I need to tell her that I know what she has done in regards to the money. I need to tell her that I am ashamed and disappointed in how this has played out and the pain she has put my dad through has made me reconsider whether our relationship should continue for the sake of my own mental well-being. But I don't know how to do this without us both ending up on the ground in screams tears and punches. My brother might have to be there to mitigate because he's about the only person who knows can withstand her verbal nasties and put her in her place.

I also need to get money from her so I can take her (yes, HER) dog to the vet asap. And no, whatever she says, Dog is not being put down because it is cheaper than a check up. She can fork over the full amount to have him taken care of or Goddess help me I will break into her house and steal her credit card to pay it myself. The vet knows I'm her daughter, he isn't going to question when I hand over her card to pay medical bills registered to her animal. I do not fear the legal consequences because my life is over anyway, and animals do not deserve to live in pain. Never ever. Plus I doubt she'd call the cops on her daughter for taking her cc to get the dog some healthcare. But who knows, she seems to be all sorts of crazy these days.

The only glimmer of joy I take in this situation: Fucktoy has a 10 year old daughter he loves more than anything in the world. Even money and sexy ladies! My mother despises raising children and has told me multiple times over the course of my life (including adulthood) if I become pregnant she is dragging me to the abortion clinic because she refuses to be a grandmother. So like, have fun with FT, because you are going to have to be a mom again whether you like it or not! Menopause isn't the end all of motherhood nanananana.

I'm heading off to the bar soon for a beer and nachos. I'm upset and don't want to be home when hubby gets back because I am a tad cross with him over his lack of help cleaning the house lately. I just need to cool down, have a beer, and have some time to myself to think everything through. Going to bring a journal and try to get back into writing. I certainly have plenty of emotions and situations to draw inspiration from.

I have tried starvation, but I have always always went back to binging. I don't know if it's an eating disorder or addiction, but it sucks. I'm also really bored with life and everything seems pointless. I am always feeling every negative emotion there is. Anger, frustration, sadness, fear etc. I'm so tired. I can't go to college because I'm too scared of the social aspect and my family is poor. I can't drive. I'm twenty years old. I have never had a real friend and I will never date anyone.

I can't believe I haven't killed myself yet.I am about 15 years old I have had depression for about 5 months now I know I am depressed but am afraid to tell my psychologist about it or my father because they might freak out if I do One day my father came into my room to help clean it up and he noticed scratch marks on my arm he was freaking out and that's why I don't want to tell him or my psychologist so that's why I turned here.,1

Maybe it's the thought of her finding me dead and probably wondering what did she to do deserve this? what did she do wrong? she is the only family I have as my father works overseas and he didnt impact my life very much,I see him just the one that sends us money so we do not starve. if there was another person to do that I wouldn't really miss him. My sister lives 2h away and I hate. she said some terrible things to my mother after she went drinking  because she wouldn't pay her some stupid debt (we couldn't afford it) and spread the rumor in our natal town ( rural town ) that my mother is a whore. my mom knows it and she got over it. she dares to look my sister in the eye and tell her ""i love you"". it's stupid.  
my mother is everything to me,but this world is just stupid to me. im thinking about the peace that may come one i close my eyes.

"I just ordered an x-acto knife on Amazon.I've been constantly thinking about it all week. I tried to go to the store and buy one, but the only one I could build courage up to go to didn't have it

It's all I think about sometimes. I've tried to kill myself with pills before, almost 3 years ago. But I woke up in the hospital. 

I've always felt so hallow, since that first attempt. Like a part of me really did die that day. I still believe maybe, if there is such a thing, that my soul died and I'm just an empty shell. Nothing inside me but a black, empty nothingness. 

I remember feeling that hole fill up. Almost completely. But lately it's stirring, swirling like a vortex and gutting me like a pumpkin.

Yet I maintain a 40 hour a week job. This past two weeks I have been awful to the people I work with, which makes it all worse. 

I hate my job, I hate that I'm still trying to rebuild my life THREE YEARS since the first attempt. I hate that I could have been on a better path where I was successful and not suffering. I hate that I can be happy and forget all about all of this over a weekend  and then return to reality when I go back to my shitty job and hate life again.


I have thought about going back on medication and have attempted to see my original doctor and make a set up and new one. But the waits and waiting lists make me uneasy.  But really though, I am ashamed to be on meds. I am afraid to be on meds. I'm just so tired and have no motivation to do anything. Because it's all in my head. It's all so draining.


I'm just tired. So tired. Physically, mentally and in my chest I feel that I am not meant to be happy.

"I don't have a reason to keep trying.Last April I tried to commit suicide, but at the last second I stopped and called my parents for help. They sent me to a rehab/mental health place to get better.

Last week I failed out of school. The entire time I was there I could feel my motivation being drained. I was on medication, but like every other pill I've tried, they weren't working. I'm trying to build up some motivation to get better, but I can't find any. I don't have a relationship to look forward to, women just use me for hookups and rebounds.

"What’s the best way to kill yourself?Hello. Sorry if the wrong subreddit.

(I’m using a throwaway account for obvious reasons.)

I really just want to die. I live in a constant state of fear and misery, and I want to end it all. My family is shitty, and I have no friends. I’m also poor as fuck. I don’t have a gun, nor do I have any rope to hang myself with.

Does anyone know the easiest way to die? I don’t want to risk failing suicide; I don’t want to get brain damage.

Besides, I’ll look like a complete fool if I survive suicide. I’d jump off a tall building, but I don’t know of any tall buildings nor how to get to one. Am I just out of luck? I’ll do anything for some answers. Thank you.

"vicious cycle. this is itSo many years of the pain eating away at me inside. 

So many years of always thinking of those things that happened to me growing up. So much anger that I moved away from my family over six months ago and changed my number because of the anger inside. No connection to family. No friends in this new city. I've lost the knowledge of what being happy even means anymore. So much anger. The same monotonous cycle of work and school every day. I force myself to act happy at work so nobody asks if i'm ok. Do you have any idea what its like to be taken advantage of so young and have to deal with that every day for the rest of your life

It has been six years since losing my best friend to suicide. Never recovering from that is like a poison that never leaves your body and slowly eats away at your soul. I can't get close to anyone for fear of losing someone and not wanting to feel that loss again. I've lost touch with how to even try to date anymore. Everyone and everything just makes me so angry everywhere I go. I hate seeing people smile. The torture of almost losing my own father to suicide. I have a coward family and that pathetic blood runs through me. 

I don't know what to do anymore. 

I think of ridding myself of this pain every day. I hate myself and how pathetic I feel every day. Nobody likes me and I have no friends.

The point of this post is that there is really no point, and just wanted to get this off my chest so at least I die feeling I’ve said it all. 

Going out on my own terms, with my own hands. So FUCK YOU world for not listening to me when I most needed you and fuck you god for not answering my prayers to make me normal and creating a fucking mistake within me, FUCK. YOU. 

Goodbye world, I won’t miss you. ",1

I don't want to exist anymoreI recently hurt the love of my life to where she’s thinking about leaving me. Just hearing her cry and feel sad makes me not want to be alive anymore. I have so much debt with school and I can’t get a job because of COVID. Lately I’ve just been thinking about the gun I have and just driving out to the middle of the desert to end it. I’ve made the worst mistake of my life and now my wife will never look at me the same way again. That alone makes me think that I don’t deserve to be alive anymore. I don’t know what to do. I feel like I’ve been shoved in a dark hole with no way out. I just wish I never existed. I don’t want to be alive feeling these emotions anymore.,1
"notesDear Mentor,


I'm sorry. I know what hurt this will cause you. (I know this because it has happened to me too... but you know this about me.) I suspect you'll feel angry and betrayed. It's possible that you will also feel guilty. It might be helpful to know that from my perspective, there's nothing you could have done--I didn't tell you how bad it had gotten. I didn't want to cause you pain. I know that sounds ridiculous, but... well, I just wanted you to know that this whole thing is a bad accident of neurochemistry and circumstance, and there's nothing you could have done to save me from myself. 


I've never had the guts to say this to you, but I love you like you're my grandmother. I'm so grateful that I had you in my life. I'm so sorry.


&amp;nbsp;


To the man who failed me,


You told me that I could count on you. But when I asked you for help, explicitly, you did not come through for me. I told you that I was in a bad way, and you bailed. 


I know you don't feel like you did anything wrong. But I still feel hurt. I still feel angry. I want you to feel guilty for your hypocrisy and your self-aggrandizing bluster; I want to punish you for hurting me. So I'm the one who's dead now, but fuck you. Fuck you.


&amp;nbsp;


Dear Therapist,


I know you tried to help me, I really do. There's only so much a person can do, and I wasn't being completely honest because I was scared. I'm grateful for your compassion, for the way you offered to talk to me on the phone if it would help, for the way your voice was always so gentle when you asked me what was going on in my head. I wanted to open up to you, but I just couldn't. I'm sorry.


&amp;nbsp;


Dear Mom and Dad,


I love you forever and always. Forgive me.",1
"So i was wondering if some people can help me with this book im doing DISCLAIMER I MIGHT NOT RESPOND FOR A WHILE AND IM SORRY FOR THAT
well before you ask, the book is about a 13 year old named dasher who has a bond with a past brother named bullet in which bullet came to the future by finding a time machine to take him to the future.
Dasher on the other hand went to get gas as requested by his gfs mother and accidentaly sprayed the gas at himself while trying to turn it off. He swallowed the gas while bullet found dasher and done cpr and passed out as well. They both woken up in a hospital and discovered that they gotten supersonic speed and fire powers by burning the infinite oil source in his blood and can run like a car on gas but infinite and faster. Bullet on the other hand has ice power due to a reverse in his blood. They both discover that doctor ligma(or limpo) has come to the future and they must stop them along with the 2 robot replicas powered by the dash ruby.
Yet again im sorry if i cant respond. 
Any recommendations are highly appreciated. If theres any questions feel free to ask. Thanks so much for understanding and helping",0
"Unlovable?Two months ago I lost the best friend I've ever had. I always told him I could be myself with him without having to put on any facade. He's the first person I've ever met since I was a little kid whom I've felt that comfortable with. With most people I have to pretend to be happier than I am, or act like things are better than they are so I'm fun to be around. I left and joined the Navy over a year ago and was kicked out last June for being bi-polar. I can't get my life back together.

I spent a few months out of state with family. It was the worst experience of my life. My mom and g'ma are great, but they have no life whatsoever (not one friend or hobby) - and I'm a fast mover. But I didn't even have money for gas to go anywhere, and I didn't know anyone other than them in the state. I have a master's degree and couldn't find a job. Just when I was about to lose it, my brother called with a job opportunity on the other end of the country. I packed up and left. It was great for 3 months... til I got laid off. My boss made it clear to me that I had done nothing wrong; he just didn't need my position anymore and couldn't afford to keep me.

That was October, and I have yet to find a job. The first week of November, I lost it and tried to kill myself. The strain was too much for my best friend. He stopped talking to me. A month ago, he sent me an email, telling me how much what I did hurt him. He was absolutely right - I was selfish and I put him through too much. He told me he still loved me, but he needed some time. It's been another month. I texted him for Christmas and told him that I miss him and am thinking about him. He has yet to respond.

The thing is, this completely justifies the whole reason I tried to kill myself in the first place! His life is obviously better without me - I was just weighing him down. Otherwise, he'd miss me by now. Also, if the one person whom I was ever myself with, whom I ever opened up to completely can't even stand to talk to me... what does that say about me?

I haven't had a real relationship in years. I can't hold onto a friendship with the sweetest, most selfless person I've ever met. I can't keep a job. All I do is suck the life out of those around me. Why in the world should I continue living? Oh, and my savings just ran out again. This week I'm moving back in with my mom and g'ma. This time I don't even have my friend to talk to from afar. Where do I go from here?

All I wanted for Christmas was my friend back... instead I got swine flu followed immediately by pneumonia. Without any income or healthcare, you can imagine how much fun that's been. I don't really care about any of that. I just want my friend to forgive me. I'm starting to believe he never will. It's been two months, and I still cry everytime I think of him. It reminds me of two things: How horrible I was to him, and My uselessness as a human being.",1

I've posted here before saying I had a date set but I delayed the decision to see if things would improve. They haven't. I'm done fighting to get better and tired of constantly losing at everything. It's just time to give up now.

It'll take too long and it'll be way too painful to wait for a natural death, so I'm doing the logical thing and ending my life on my own terms. Just need to get a few more affairs in order and I'll be ready to go.

I got straight Ds in all my classes 

My teachers have informed me I will have to take summer school

Iâ€™m a dyke 

Iâ€™ve been a complete shit to everyone in my life

The people at school will be sad for about a month and then move on with their lives

My father has molested me and gotten away with it

And Iâ€™m a completely unlikable person who canâ€™t get anything done despite being given countless extra aid

Once my family is asleep in around 2-3 hours Iâ€™ll sneak into the kitchen grab the antihistamines, grab my sprite, lock myself in the bathroom and take everything in it. My family will find me in the morning, I know theyâ€™ll be heartbroken but here I am doing it anyway, so yâ€™all canâ€™t say Iâ€™m a good person at heart, because Iâ€™m doing this to my family and myself.

I love you

"1 yearTried to hang myself around a year ago. I was living by myself at university and had absolutely no friends just my girlfriend. Boring job where no one likes me or speaks to me, crippling anxiety as a result of a bad childhood and parenting. I had just been arrested and wanted out so used a belt to hang myself. I unfortunately came around and called an ambulance. 

One year on and back living with parents I am more depressed than ever. No one cares that I attempted suicide and am severely depressed. My parents give me no space and make my life horrible. My girlfriend expects so much for me and I feel our relationship is not a 50/50 effort but she is my only friend. 

I am ugly as fuck and 5’6 with no social skills whatsoever. I will probably get kicked out of university and my work and get a criminal record. 

I will probably attempt suicide in the near future by crashing my car at high speed so as to avoid the chance of survival",1

I’ve done inpatient time and always proactively spoke down with people and attempted to look myself 
(note the health care system and bad doctors who have been flippant with meds haven’t helped)

What i don’t understand is this misconception that people who want to kill themselves feel like other will be better off without them?
I know I am destroying lives around me when I think about trying... are those who don’t understand just trying to justify it?

I have become adjusted to the depression but my fiancee is the one who suffers the most for it. I can see my depression sinking into her. Sometimes I feel like the only way to save her is kill myself before I ruin her life. I know that won't help, of course, but it seems so unfair to keep her trapped in a relationship that doesn't give her what she needs and deserves. It almost feels like I should save her the trouble and rip off the bandaid sooner than later, before I've done too much damage.",1

"A window into my life, I guess.. this was an email I sent to someone last night. Typos probably.Depression. Anxiety. Being alone. Not truly being needed by anyone here. It sucks. It hurts. No one needs me here. I'm just here for the sole purpose of existing. No one would care or notice if I disappeared tonight. No one bothers to ask me how I'm doing today. No one stops to ask me if I'm doing okay. Everyone has a group of friends who love them endlessly and actually want to see them outside of school and talk to them and everything. I'm just a background decoration in everyone's lives and all I need is to just be validated. All I ever wanted was... to feel wanted. This life is literal hell. It's my personal hell. I'd rather be anywhere but here. I'd rather be anyone else but me. I don't want this body. I don't want this life. Maybe if I go, people will notice. No one fucking talks to me unless they need me to listen to their problems and GOD I WANT TO HELP BUT IT SUCKS THAT I'M JUST A PERSONAL THERAPIST TO EVERYONE. JUST ONCE, I'D LIKE SOMEONE TO TEXT ME LIKE ""Hey ----, how are you feeling today?"" or a message like ""You matter to me and I need you here."" No one fucking cares. People say they do but no one fucking listens to me when I text them asking for help. My insides are crying ""save me now."" Fuck this life. Fuck this world. I don't want to be me. 

I feel so fucking alone. I'm so sick of waking up every single day and wishing I didn't. I am sick of crying so much. I can't fucking stand being such an outcast. All I ever fucking wanted was to fit in. I hate myself more than words could ever fucking describe and I just want to blow my face to goddamn bits with a shotgun. I feel so goddamn bad that you have to read this shit because it's not easy to hear these kind of words. I hate that I care about everyone so goddamn much. I wish I could stop. When everyone else wakes up, their nightmares end. Mine never does. Everyday I pray that I'll wake up from this dream and be a happy, beautiful child who is loved by everyone. This mental illness is tearing me up right in front of everyone's eyes and no one cares. I talk about killing myself a lot. And I bet if I were to be in the middle of killing myself, no one would stop me. I've been depressed since I was a child. Wanna know what fucking sucks about teen depression? While everyone is living the best years of their life by going to parties, making awesome memories, falling in love, and so on... I'm not. I'm wishing my own fucking life away. I'm scared that I'll just be thrown into a hospital again and be put on meds that just make me feel so damn numb. I am so ready to go. I don't want to be here anymore. Everyday is a battle with myself. It's like going to war with the enemy... and each battle ends in your bitter defeat. But you still show up on the battle field every day even though you know you're going to get your ass kicked. Each day, the wounds become deeper and more severe. You grow weaker and weaker. And then one day, you wave a white flag and it's over. Or the enemy finally kills you. Either way, you will lose to your demons.

"I made someone I love cut me off todayI am a very toxic person. There was this person that was nice to me for 2 weeks, and I fell in extreme love with her. She didn't like me because of my look and also because of my issues. But she still talked to me and we became close friends. She then liked someone else, and she trusted me and shared with that after I said I would be okay if she wanted to share anything with me. Well she gave up on that person and in the end, she went with someone else. I could never really get over my feelings as long as I was around her. So I would often have bursts where I would be really toxic and mean to her. I would do it so she can delete me so I stop feeling that way, cause I didnt want to abandon her. I loved her too much and way too much, like really too much. I was obsessed crazy, I would think about her all day, I would always have her in my thoughts, thinking of how she is doing, feeling insecure and stuff. She dealt with my shit always. But I kept pushing it and going far, in the end I got what I ""wanted"" and got deleted by her. But now I feel so sad and down. I feel so bad. I feel so shit. I wish I could beg and go back. But I would be a burden and it would be a repeat. I cannot handle my jealousy. She has someone. She isnt lonely. She will be fine. She will be okay. I hope all of that. I will never have her. I will never mean anything much to her. I got deleted mainly because I mentioned bad about her boyfriend at the end, I never thought the thing that would make her delete me would be that. Over her boyfriend and what I said was just a fact related to a game. I hate her as well. I love her as well. It was just 2 weeks that she made me feel so good. So why do I feel so shit?",1
"barely getting byi really need to get this off my chest, its late and im sleepy cus i stayed up for animal crossing 

TLDR; having a really difficult time moving on from my first long term relationship concurrent to the coronavirus shit happening and its wearing me down

late february my partner of 2yrs broke up w me (details on that is in my post history). he wants to still be friends so we've been not talking for a month or two and then we're gonna meet up and talk about how we feel about being friends

shortly after all the covid-19 stuff started blowing up very quickly

my friends have done soooo much for me to be here for me and support me thru all this, which has helped a lot. im also really into dance dance revolution, so going to the arcade and getting back into it helped a lot as well. but, as you know, the govt. started advocating self quarantine, as well as places this week have started closing - everything that was keeping me afloat (hanging out w friends &amp; going to the arcade) was quite literally taken away from me and ive been doing progressively worse this week

i cant even go to see my therapist bc they arent doing in office appointments. im gonna be doing my appointment thru call but still

i had my life laid out and planned out with him after i were to graduate community college later this year - something that we had talked about for a while...now, i have no idea what im doing with my life. ive been living day by day because im not mentally or emotionally capable of thinking past a few days from now, which i know is bad for the long run

also, miku expo, which rarely ever comes to my area when its in the USA, was postponed to september (originally was gonna happen in may) and i really cant see a future past that for myself. i dont have a plan of harming myself, but i just dont know what im living or doing anymore

people have been telling me i'll find another person who is ""the one"" / that if this wasnt meant to be, then it just means that something better is to come but everything was truly perfect; i really thought this was it. we've been through so much together and changed so much together and we were unstoppable and everything really feels like it's falling apart",1

"Trust me, it can be worse.Back in 2010 I just got out of high school and was doing absolutely fuck all with myself. I was bored, living with the parent, had no ambition, and had no idea what the hell I was supposed to do with myself. So I sat around and jerked off all day.

Well, luck has it that I started doing lots of drugs around this time, and stumbled across doing copious amounts of Benadryl to induce a ""trip"". You mean Benadryl, the sleep aid and antihistamine? Wow, that sounds fun. So I started doing it. A Lot. And Often.

It was ""fun"" in the sense that being a delusional schizophrenic for 12-24 hours is fun. Which was. It was great. So great, that I did it over and over and over and over. I did upwards of 6000mg over the course of a few months. What the fuck was I thinking, you may ask? I have no idea. It never once occurred to me that it would have any lasting effect.

So fast forward some months and I eventually got sick of it and stopped, but so much damage had already been done. I could not concentrate on anything, I could not focus, I couldn't remember fuck all. I used to spend time with friends every single night, and that slowly turned into torture. The words would not form. Conversations would go on and I would just sit there. I had no part in them. Nothing would occur to me to say. The clutch of anxiety gripped my heart at every moment. Being around people at all became extremely uncomfortable, no matter how hard I tried, no matter what I said, there was no connection. 

So I started avoiding people. Trying to figure out what the fuck happened. My brain was so scrambled that I actually had no idea what the problem could even be, the extent of the damage. It took almost a year for me to put the pieces together. And things only got worse. Benadryl fucked up my brain, fucked up my heart, kidneys, liver, bladder, whatever. Everything. Everything hurts, I have issues that I shouldn't have until I'm 80. Constant pain and no reprieve. I feel and enjoy next to nothing. My brain is not producing very much of the ""ok that feels good"" chemicals. I can't remember shit, my mind is a fuzzy and fractured mess, I can barely put a sentence together. I am not a functional human being. I don't even bother trying to talk to people any more. There is abso-fucking-lutely no point. The only thing I enjoy doing any more is sleeping. Sleep is fucking great, because I can be a giddy idiot in my dreams and not remember the sickening reality of the situation.

It's not even the physical pain. I can live with that. It's the feeling of nothingness. I got no kicks. None of the shit I used to enjoy doing does fuck all for me any more. I am dead inside, and I have been for years. It is hell.

I've tried, oh yes, I've tried. I smacked myself in the face and forced myself to go commiserate with other humans and actually managed for a few months. But regardless of what I do, I could never shake the feeling. There is always that shadow looming in the background. The words all feel hollow. I'm sick of forced smiles. I have nothing to share because nothing matters to me any more; it can't. The damage will never be repaired. Yesterday is fuzzy, a week ago fuzzier still, good fucking luck remembering last month or last year. 

I'm not going to tell you that your situation doesn't suck ass. It probably does. But trust me, it can be worse. Every tiny comfort can be taken away from you, crushed to dust and scattered to the wind right in front of your eyes, leaving you a bystander to your own miserable existence. Embrace the little shit that you still enjoy. What do you think anyone lives for? The tiny dose of chemical happiness you feel when things go your way.

Why did I type this? I don't know, a warning? A little pick-me-upper to someone else who's down? I don't know. I'm just reaching the absolute end of my rope and figured I'd share my own personal hell that I have been living with for the past 7 years. Nobody in my life needs to know, because nothing can be done. It's a foregone conclusion. The family that is stuck dealing with me would only suffer more if they knew the details of the story. It's better if they just think I'm an antisocial little shitcake instead of knowing the extent of it.

I pray that you enjoy what time you have left.",1

I am not doing better. I cannot anymore. I’ve done everything in my power to lie to everyone in my life that I’m doing better. That I’m fine. I’m not sad anymore. everyone. every person. I don’t know.
i am not a person anymore. i am an empty shell. i am nothing. i am watching myself. i am hollow. sometimes i am half full, but lately i have been half empty. 
my therapist doesn’t want to see me. i am so sad, i am insane. ill do anything to feel again, to feel something again. i promise. i want to talk to my therapist.
for the first few sessions, i do not want him to talk. i want to let everything. let my sadness out of my body. i’ll let him reach inside my head and let it out. i need a person to hear my screams. i need a person to save me. i can’t swim anymore. i am drowning. i have never been this scared of the future, the present, the past before. everything is haunting me. everything is keeping me from happiness. my head is heavy. i need to let it out. 
he’ll hear me and whatever advice or knowledge he will give me, i will take. i will use it so hard. i will do anything to let myself up for air. i am suffocating. i need to be opened.
it is selfish to say, but i have watched myself and watched others. i cannot be more empty and sadder than anyone else.
i am but a hypocrite. i say i cannot feel but then claim that i am sad. i don’t know. is it bad to not know? here i am, continuing to lie.. i am sorry.
i will take any words of advice before i drown. anything.
he will hear me. why must i think that a person can cure me? give me strength? no one believes i am strong. i am weak and drowning.
i am being taken away. i will soon be nothing. no, i am already nothing. what is below nothing? nonexistent. that is my name.
im not sad. I’m not sad. being terribly sad made me unable to be sad again.
i no longer panic. never anxious. i thought i was happy because i didn’t feel those. but, along with those i grew unable to feel any other emotion. are those emotions, at all?
i no longer crave to be around others. before, i loved their presence. i loved seeing smiles, new faces, and familiarity. i loved love.
now, love is absent. i question it. i suffer from my lack of. 
i question everything, without emotion. but don’t care. my suffering drained me.
i don’t know if i am this way or not, i am unable to know. i am expressionless. faking it has become hard. my lies made everyone proud of me, so why am i broken? i have never been whole, being broken would not be a surprise. 
continuing my life is difficult, but my only other option. i don’t care enough to kill. killing involves me caring. crying involves me feeling. i can't.
i can’t let anyone know. i am trying so hard to have a heart again. i want the world to see that i am okay, i will force myself to be content with my emptiness. 
the last real thing i felt was hate. hate for myself. i was awful, with my horrifying thoughts and all. others’ trust for me was ever alive. 
just like me. being alive will truly be a new experience. i say i will never kill, but what if it is my only way to being alive? 
people have grown tired of coddling me, taking care of me. i am a burden. pretending to be happy and healthy made their life easier. they were actually happy.

"""A girlfriend won't solve anything.""And I agree.

Really, I don't doubt you.

Having a girlfriend is not going to make my childhood/current abuse and trauma any better. It's not going to magically make my mental illnesses go away. I'm not oblivious to the fact that it won't *solve* anything.

But fuck you if you say it won't *help*. And fuck you if you say I'm just whining about being single. You've no idea the fucking bullshit pain I've seen and felt all throughout my life. My entire 17 years on this planet were ripped away from me by abuse trauma illness and a lot more. 

And fuck you if you think a girlfriend won't make it just a little better.

But idk tho... I'll never be loved anyway. I know that for a fact. And its a fact I cant accept.",1

"Another night. No sleep again, I can see it already. Can't take any more of this.I have no medical reason to not sleep, just depression and anxiety. Last time I slept was three days ago, coming up on 80 hours. So depressed, so anxious, just want it to be over.",1
"I thought being intimate with someone would solve all my problemsI used to think about killing myself every night.  I would lie down in bed and begin thinking about my deepest insecurity-- my crushing and all-encompassing loneliness.  My inability to connect with anyone on an emotional level seemed at once irreparable and impossible to get over.

The only way I could see out of this amalgam of sadness and helplessness seemed, naturally, suicide.  I was so devastatingly broken that with each passing day my pit of solitude grew ever deeper as I slowly lost any remnant of a capacity to connect with someone.

I never really got close to doing it.  Every time I thought seriously about it, my mind would drift to my loving parents and grandparents who sacrificed so much and wanted only to see me happy.  But the thought of it, just the idea that it was possible, that there was an escape, numbed the pain a tiny bit.

It became so commonplace that I would find myself rubbing my wrists, whispering the words ""I'm going to cut my wrists,"" without even realizing it.  It was my natural reaction to sad thoughts.  I was stuck in this rut for 3 years straight.

Then, one day, I met a girl.  Actually, I already knew her.  But we went out for a drink and long story short, she was in my bed that night.  She fell asleep before me and I lay, her arms around me, staring at the ceiling with a big grin on my face.  It didn't seem real.. I had literally had dreams about this so many times that I had to keep reminding myself that it was really happening.  I was so happy...

And then I wasn't.  A few minutes later, lost in thought... ""I'm going to cut my wrists.""  Rubbing.  I caught myself... ""What the fuck?""  I convinced myself it was just force of habit, muscle memory from so many nights of repetition.  I even found some morbid humor in it.

Well it's been a month.  She's my girlfriend now.  She's sweet, fun, caring, affectionate, and quite attractive.  Everything I ever wanted, beyond what I ever thought I could get.

And still... every night... ""I'm going to cut my wrists.""

what the fuck is wrong with me?

Wow that was long.  Felt good to write though.  Never spoken about any of that to anybody, even online.

tl;dr: Idly fantasized about killing myself every night for years because I was so lonely.  have a wonderful girlfriend who sleeps in my bed every night.  Still fantasize about killing myself...",1

"I can't enjoy anything.I know I'm deep in the grievence stages due to a ""potentional"" break up, but for some reason this low has been the lowest I had ever been in my life.  It could have been that she picked me up from a low point, and showed me joy I hadn't felt in ages.. But it's taken its toll on her, and after four years she's looking to get out. 

I've contemplated and fantasized no differently than some.  I've attempted twice, once I couldn't go through with the level of comfort not being able to cut off my carotid artery properly and another because the idea of friends and family.  It happened at different stages of my life, and I feel like I'm finally getting to the stage where I have money, no will, and no attachments despite knowing people care.  I struggled with the idea of hurting those around me, but now I find myself just not wanting to deal with what's in me and understand the rippling effects it could cause.. But I'm caring less and less.

I'm getting physically ill, and riddled with anxiety seeing things in public, reading people's experience, and trying to understand what is suppose to be next in my future.  I've long been living a life where I have been carefully putting one step infront of the other, careful not to trip. I'm now in vertigo, with no where to go.  I don't know how I want to live anymore, I was able to have clairvoyance at one point.. But that is now all gone.  I've been in numerous long term relationships where I keep having to pick myself up and try again.. But now I feel like it is useless, it doesn't matter anymore.. I'm destined to live a life like this; and I'm tired. 

I would have ended it a few weeks ago, but I have no idea if I have a leathal dose of methephedamines to do me in or could further my problem. I decided to wait to be a little more rational and melodical.  I had a promise to myself amongst friends, almost a bloodpact that by either 18 or 30 I would commit suicide.  I'm on 30, and have had the worst year of my life despite achieving a dream.. That dream came with consequences that I didn't foresee or would ever want, now my dream is filled with regret and misery.. I feel trapped. My self worth has hit the newest low, and I find the hate that I have had for myself has deepended.   I love who I designed myself to be, but for some reason it has been fruitless in many different assets, and I feel as if I failed.

I'm trying to hang in there, but all hope is fleeting.  I can't see why I think this way, why I have thought this way for so long.  Why being loved by someone is so important to me.  Why my friends and parents love doesn't sit the same way. I feel like I'm pitiful for my woes, and it just perputuates a vicious cycle of repeating but unable to get out. ",1

"drunk, not in crisishoping this isn't against the rules...

i'm suicidal by default. i have been for almost a decade now, but i'm powering through it. i'm just so tired.

i have a long-term partner and a cat who are worth living for. i've also gone through two funerals of people who offed themselves, both very close to me and younger than i am now. i can't help but envy them. they both blew their brains out and i don't have the same access, nor am i that brave.

i'm transgender and keep having to delay for financial reasons. i think my partner will stay with me after, but there is still a risk so delaying is a blessing and a curse. 

there is an xacto blade somewhere in our spare room but i am not sure exactly where. i'm not trying to relapse into self harm or to have my partner find me in the tub tomorrow morning. not hurting people is my main drive to keep going. it is not for myself. 

i could get in the car but i also could survive whatever accident i cause for myself so it's probably not worth it. i just...don't know how to become the person that i want to be. i don't know if it's possible. so is it even worth it to try?

"Why do I keep trying to get better?I'm so so exhausted.  I've been severely depressed and chronically suicidal for 10 years.  I've had several attempts over the years, and a lot more ""close calls"".  I've tried various combinations of meds and been in individual and group therapy, I even spent a year in a residential treatment facility.  I've literally had more psych hospitalizations than I can count.

&amp;#x200B;

Even when I'm having a good few days, I can't really enjoy them because I'm just bracing myself for the bad to come back.  Everyone is always like ""It gets better!!!! uwu "" and like, yeah, it does, but it never stays better.  Why look forward to the good when the bad is just going to come right back?

&amp;#x200B;

Why should I fight to get better when the fighting will never stop?  Even if my mental health gets better, there's so much social injustice and shit about the world.  What's to point in bettering myself internally if I can't make things better for myself externally and things will continue to suck?  Why should I make my mental health better?  I don't *want* to be able to put up with how awful the world is.  But I also don't want to be stuck fighting for a better world for all of my life.

&amp;#x200B;

I hate this chronic suicidality.  Wanting to die is my baseline.  I've gotten better at managing the impulsiveness, but that just means the thoughts and urges have evolved and changed, and become more dangerous.  The impulsive suicidal behaviors have decreased, but the more planned out, thoughtful, more likely to be successful thoughts (and to some extent behaviors) have taken over.

&amp;#x200B;

I had a planned attempt back in May, and a very planned almost-attempt (a friend talked me out of it) a little over a month ago.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm just so tired.  I'm not currently actively planning anything but the thoughts and urges are absolutely there and I don't really know why I'm fighting them.  It's not for myself, that's for sure.  It's for people I care about, who care about me.  I don't want to hurt them.  But I feel like I am forced to make the choice to either hurt my loved ones or continue on in a world that hurts me.  I hate that decision.",1
"I failed everyone... including methis is just a little something that has bothered me more and more as time goes on. As a kid, I was always seen as the poster child for basketball in my family. Everyone knew I was good and I would practice almost everyday with dreams of just dominating day in and day out. I even ended up being a team captain my senior year when I went to a school with over 650 kids and a good reputation in ball. All that changed my first week of the season.

I ended up doing terrible as even though I would do good in practice, Coach would never put me in for games in order to make time for his favorites. I would openly challenged them and outplay them but I never got the spot my sophomore or junior year . Now my first senior game and I’m sucking? Geez how fun. I ended up getting benched for one of the younger guys and later that week I sustained horrible nerve damage in my left arm that would leave me basically handicapped for 6 months. It still bothers me now and then, but to know that I let all of my peers and loved ones down was a complete bummer. 

I lost all my confidence in turn and now I don’t even know what to do. I don’t know who I am. I feel like I never got a chance to prove my worth, and now everyday it’s in the back of my mind of “what if.” I totally let down my parents even though they never showed up to any of my games. I was always just trying to be the best I could be and I thought it would be good enough; in turn I ended up with nothing and now I’m rejected by almost everyone I know because of what a fuck up I am. All the kids blame me it feels like and they just distanced themselves. I feel like a reject. 

Every week having to go to sports medicine to try and recover what was left of my season and not even getting the green light to at-least sit the bench without warmups never happened. I never was respected or loved the same and I felt alone. 

People will poke fun at me too because I couldn’t even move my arm in the beginning for the first month and when it was out of my arm sleeve it would just fucking flip around like a noodle. But the numbing was traumatizing and the nerves would tingle with pain. I fucking hated every second of it. I let down everyone and I’m not worth shit. I’m a failure. I fucking failed even though I put years and years of dedication and no matter what anyone told me I kept going for nothing. It was all for nothing. I’m a nobody now at my highschool and I don’t even want to talk to anyone because I don’t feel like there is anyone that I CAN talk to about this. I feel like it would only make things worse.

"I apologize for posting this, as I write it.Hi. My name is Trent, I'm sixteen, and I've been dealing with depression for a while. I was alone as a kid until the fifth grade when I met my first friend. I was picked on a lot. I know this post is dumb and I'm sorry for posting it, I've been trying to post for the past three nights but every time I finish I just erase everything since it's worthless text. 



I'm sorry for anyone who knows me in real life on this reddit account. I'd use a throwaway if I didn't feel like I'd be quitting life soon. 



I don't really want to start by telling my story. I've wrote it so many times, I know that people don't care at this point. Last September I went to the hospital for the second time because I was extremely suicidal. I've been sick from school with mono for the past few days, and I'm feeling extremely lonely. 



I don't know. I'm sorry I'm not saying enough, and I'm sorry I'm saying anything. I'm terrified of the idea of being liked or disliked, and how thin the line is. Maybe this is all silly. Maybe I should give up, erase this, go to bed and find the bottle of Tylenol when I wake up. But I'm writing this post to try and find alternative routes. 



I like music. Kid Cudi. Kanye West. Of course, everyone makes fun of him 24/7, so it's hard to be motivated by him nowadays. 



I'm sorry. I'm going back to crying. I love you guys, this subreddit is amazing and I'm sorry I feel this way.",1

"The feeling of isolation...It’s so hard to put into words the feelings, emotions and urges to want to give into giving up... I just don’t see what the point to life is anymore. It’s become this rinse, lather &amp; repeat kind of existence and I never thought I would ever feel like this, but I do.  And while I know I have family &amp; friends who care (or supposedly care) I can literally go DAYS without a call, text or some kind of human interaction and almost 100% of the time I’m the person who initiates it. Which just reinforces the thoughts in my head where I sit here an think of just how easy it could be... it use to be feeling guilty that would make me think exiting stage right would upset people &amp; it would... maybe... but now I don’t care any more about “them”, because I feel like if any of them gave a shit, I wouldn’t feel so alone and rejected.

So the why is complicated... I’ve been dealing with various health crap my entire life.. from the mild of dealing with learning disabilities caused by brain damage I was born with, to finding out that my dad had a rare genetic disease which caused his cancer and my parents coming clean when I was 12 and ironically right before I was diagnosed with it myself. Surgery to prevent cancer to surgery which found cancer, to getting poked, prodded &amp; probed between once a year to every few months, to more surgery, more cancer... somewhere in the middle of my mess, my dad died, my world crashed and my mom decided to start smoking again and waste so much money on opiates to not have to deal with the emotional pain of losing my dad. I lost 2 parents that wee early morning, 7 hours before the last semester before I graduated w/ my AA... I worked so hard trying to get it before my dad passed... my dad and I were close... he was my go to for how to deal with shit and now that he’s gone, it’s kinda me going alone... we’ll it wasn’t always but last year my BF tells me the day before that he’s moving out... what?!? No discussions noth8ng just peace out... I’ll try to help if I can... then I figure out how he was able to do it... he took advantage of my trust and my memory because he’d take money out to pay the rent... only I had already paid it... now I’m dealing with the fact that I have cancer w/o a cure and no one cares enough to want to help me or really be there for me... so if I ever get to the point where I can’t live alone they want to put me in an old person home... wtf... I’d rather end shit on my terms and give those assholes in my life who supposedly love me, the finger and let them deal with the fact that I’d rather die free than live ina place that wreaks of disgusting bodily fluids and decay... no thank you... which makes me wonder why I bother doing all this crap to myself when ultimately no one cares if I’m here or not.

I just am so tired of being alone.... tired of fighting and then confused when people tell me not to give up but then flip around and question why I fight so hard... wtf am I suppose to give up &amp; in and just wait to die?!? If so screw that..

Not saying I’m going to do it now... but some days it’s really hard to find a reason to keep fighting ... especially when the ones who supposedly love you could give a rats ass if I’m here or not... I’m just so tired ",1

"girl in need seeking words of wisdomto the kind readers of SW - 

I am writing because I don't know where else to turn.  I have been struggling with depressive symptoms since middle school, but was not diagnosed until my freshman year of high school (in which I developed an eating disorder that required hospitalization).  I became involved with someone similarly depressed, and we fell very deeply in love.  He made me better, and I brought out the best in him.  We had a very passionateHe broke up with me a year later because he realized how serious things were at such a young age, and he wanted both of us to have ""normal"" high school and college experiences.  It took me a few years to fully let go, but I was able to feel like my life had a purpose about six months after the break up.  To this day, getting over him was the hardest thing I have ever done; I have never felt so hopeless and helpless in my entire life.

For many years after that heart-wrenching break-up, I drowned myself in so, so many relationships (that I realize now were meaningless) to avoid the horror of myself.  I have spent so many years in self-loathing that I don't know which way is up.  The problem is that nobody (including myself) understands why.  I have a loving, successful, and supportive family; I attend Boston College; I've never had trouble making friends, and have always been considered popular.  I've always been told I'm stunning, beautiful, gorgeous, etc., but I don't (and have never) felt any of these things.

After spending some much needed time to myself (without any boyfriends), I met a very caring person who brings out the best in me.  The problem is that being with him makes all my depressive symptoms come back (and not by any fault of his own).  I just can't figure out why.  I'm exhausted from the emotional roller coaster that is my life.  I never want to get up in the morning; every day I wake up on the wrong side of the bed.  I have to feign happiness in every social setting, and I'm sick of it.  I'm sick of feeling inadequate, unworthy, and most of all, sick from unhappiness.  I can't motivate myself to do anything.  When I go to the gym, I can't finish a work out.  On my days off, I watch TV for 12 hours at a time.  I have accomplished nothing I set out to do for this whole summer, and I dislike every single part of my life.

I am posting this because nothing else has helped.  Not therapy, not medication, not talking to friends.  I'm at my breaking point, and I honestly feel like I am incapable of being happy. I want more than anything to get better, to BE better, I just don't know how.  Please, anyone, do you have some advice for me?  I can't tell you how much it would mean to me for some useful advice about how to get out of my own head and off of the damn couch.

Thank you for your time and for listening.  I hope to return the favor someday.",1

"Want do it but not want to. !vent post?State of agony. And living at this point or line is just overwhelming. I might be sent to the hospital on Monday, because really everything has been done but nothing has helped. I know, that i am responsible. But why would somebody want to fuck up their good life, act and do everything to just drag it down more and more. If i would be put into a hospital and if i got out from there, i would still want to die, due the reason that it's a shame, mental hospital, like what's up with you. Because of my reputation and who i have become when depression hit me. There is just no escaping it. God i'm so behind in life already. If i had a gun, i'd probably sit for hours and thinking if it is the right play or not. But i don't have one. And it would be pretty hard i guess to be able to get hold of some wishmakers. I have felt pyhsical pain, hard one's before in my life, but really going for hanging is probably veeery painful. 

Wish there was an easy way out, but there never is, is it. But the fact of the matter is that there is no escaping yourself. Unless i travel far far away and just escape, leave my old identity and everything behind me. I am constantly thinking about death and my state of mind, my brain, the way i think, it has become very ill and sick. And oh there's too much more to that than just a couple of these lines over here. 

The reason of this post? I don't know, if i could tell 3 months ago old me, that think of what all might go south, when you keep acting like this and believing that everything is fucked, the life is over, when back then it actually wasn't and i was the happiest man on this planet. It's strange how things can change so fast. You've built your reputation up all your life and then suddenly boom step by step, isolation and all that comes with MDD (not an official diagnosis), it really managed to get hold of me and take me. Before i turned my computer on i felt such anger and i was like the  guy in LOTR who wants the ring, the monster guy (EDIT Gollum- My Sincere Condolences in front of all LOTR fans and people). Now i got some lines out of me, in addidtion pills to sleep for an even bit. 

**I regret that i have chosen this path of destruction, letting go of the best days of my life, life is too short to just throw it away, but when you have just given up and everything seems and is at this point just unbearable, and now i will never reach out to that level as all of my other friends will and so on and so forth.**",1

..I don't know.

There are a thousand reasons to post, and a thousand more to delete these words. I realize that a lot of you are here to mock people like me. People that complain, and I realize that there are some of us who take so much for granted. Who don't see what we have and dwell in the past. I realize I may be one of them, though I still look in the mirror and find nothing staring back. My greatest moments are the mornings that I wake, and can't remember who I am, or why I am where I am..For a small window of time. I have a lot of reasons for why I think I am the way I am, and they might not be an excuse, I understand that. But it's the only thing I can think of to get myself through the day. 

My dad died. That's all I can start it off as. From junior high up to my twentieth birthday, he was an alcoholic, and my mother relied on prescription medication like Atavan, Methadone.. He was the only sane parent, but we cared for my ninety-six year old grandmother, his parents long out of state to avoid responsibility, and he lost himself in the alcohol. Now that I am older, I don't blame him. You need one way to cope, and he lost the war. My mother goaded him on with her bullshit. She stole from me. She took credit cards out under my name. We moved three times a year until we finally left state. From California, to Texas, hoping that he would fix himself. I won't forget the day he died.

It was.. Five. Six days to thanksgiving, 2009. We had just returned from Texas, left him in a trailer he bought on his retirement, because my mother talked him into it. I won't forget how he reeked of piss, how he'd lost so much weight due to some.. Illness, or when we'd drive by the trailer park every day. Take him to get groceries. Clothes. He'd always be in the driveway, drunk, unconscious. I hated him. For beating me. For not being the man I knew growing up. For abandoning my sister and I when we needed him the most. None of his family helped us. Until the day he died. My grandparents found him. Dead. Sober for two weeks, and then we fought. Told him if he forced us to give him his money, he would drink, and we wouldn't see him again. He called the night before he died. Asked my sister and I to visit him. Have pudding. When we arrived, the duct tape was up. The police were guarding the trailer, and they wouldn't let me see him. My grandmother, his mother. Hugged me. Said my mother better take responsibility for what had happened. I was too shocked to understand. 

They all came flooding in. Family. Just for the funeral, after ten years of silence. Ten years of not giving a shit, and suddenly, they don't want pissing games. A week later. Thanksgiving had passed. They wanted to see us for the holidays. Just me and my sister. Just to tell us what we did wrong. What they saw when they found him. How they found him. And to tell us, word for word. That we did not try hard enough. They call themselves family,  and until now. four years later. It has all been the same. No one is genuine, I fail at every turn. Twenty-three. No college career. The only person I care about tells me I care because they're the only person that has been kind to me for years. I am only a good friend. I can't come back from the debt of carrying my family while my parents were unconscious for months on the couch at seventeen. 

I can't do anything.

Death is not an option. It never was. I am afraid of the darkness. The ever lasting sleep. Of pain. But I want it. A reason to stop, because I have seen what life is. What true, nine to five, married, family, every day life can do to you.

..I don't want to do it.",1
"Just... tired. Running out of reasons to keep going.I don't really know where to begin and I've attempted to post here before but I never end up submitting anything. Once I start typing it comes out all wrong and ends up being just a mountain of text and I never feel like I've actually said anything. So, I'll try to keep it short and concise. 

Basically, I've been sad for a while, but I was drinking heavily and that made things better because at least I didn't have to feel. I had this amazing magical substance that gave me control over my emotions. Then my mom died and then within three months I got sober. I've had a couple ""baby"" relapses, but they weren't shit. I didn't feel better. It wasn't like before. Drinking didn't make me feel good. Nothing makes me feel good. Instead, I just get angry. I'm angry and I lash out at those closest to me.

But lately I've begun to feel this sense of overwhelming frustration. Towards everything. My friend's don't understand. I try to explain but then I just get told how I'm being ridiculous or irrational or how I ""need to calm down."" I don't enjoy anything anymore. I don't go out anymore. Being around my friends makes me angry. I feel like I can't explain my feelings in a way that will make them understand. So why bother? I treat my friends badly because I want them to feel as miserable as I do. Because then they would understand. I feel tired and defeated; a slave to my emotions. I'm getting locked into a state of constant bitterness. 

I just really need to know that someone understands.",1

I had a lot of ambitions coming out of college, but I don't know that I have the strength of mind and character to do what I want to do. I'm watching my dreams and my relationships with my family and my girlfriend of almost a year crumble from beneath me, especially in the past few days. I am frustrated and lonely. I don't know how likely it is that I'll take action, but I tend to surprise even myself with the things that I say and do.",1

"Girlfriend just quit on me after breaking down and telling me she loved me 3 days agoI don’t really have anywhere to go with this so I just need somebody to know. My girlfriend just broke up with me a day ago after breaking down and telling me she loved me 3 days ago. We both came from similar backgrounds of being emotionally abused by our previous significant others, but we started to fall in love nevertheless over the past few months. She was engaged previously but definitely gave me every impression she was moved on and ready to be with me. I have extreme trust issues because my previous girlfriend of 5 years abandoned me about a year ago after treating me like I was worthless for over a year at the end of our relationship.

My newer now ex-girlfriend and I started to become super close over the past couple of months and we both confided in each other a lot of really deep personal things and I was actually able to trust her with that information. She broke up with me because things were moving too quickly even though she claimed she meant it that she loved me a couple of days ago. 

How can somebody be so cold out of nowhere after letting their defenses down and starting to love me and why does this keep happening to me? Please help",1

Any advice for 16 year old?I honestly don’t know where to go about this except here. I guess since I don’t know anyone here it feels more easier or something? Basically I been feeling unwanted and unloved and unliked by everyone for 2 years. Nothing seems to be working out. Feel as if I’m being judged or people playing with my mind. I don’t feel smart or like I’m capable at anything in life. Just I feel pointless and other issue that are driving me crazy. I’m too nervous and full of anxiety. Sad and alone and hardly anyone knows. It’s like no one sees I’m sad or notices. Like they don’t care. I been wanting to just leave for so long cause I’m tired of feeling this way but I can’t do it either. Which makes me feel like a coward. I’m 16 though so I’m young right? I hardly had an impact on life so my death is far less bad than someone else right? My death wouldn’t be bad because I’m young while others or older had a bigger impact already. Anyone know what to do? I’m running out of options that I feel are successful.,1

A third of my life is already over and I have nothing to show for it. I dread getting older because it feels as if no one cares about middle aged women. 

I don't want to tell my therapist that I'm suicidal because I don't want to go to the hospital. Especially since I have not mustered the courage to attempt suicide. I know there are people worse off but I just don't want my life and feel that I should be able to opt out if I want to. Nobody needs me anyway. I can easily get replaced at work. I cant relate to my coworkers who are all in relationships. I can't connect to any of them.

I've tried Meetup groups but I feel that'll go nowhere, just like how online dating has gone nowhere for me and how making friends at work is going nowhere.

"Life is empty and without purpose, why do I feel this way?I don’t want to self diagnose myself with depression or something, but I just always feel depressed. I have two parents, a brother, family, and “friends”. (By friends I mean friend groups where I have to invite myself over if they won’t or that I am too distant from. ) I never had addiction, illnesses or anything, so WHY do I feel this way? Why do I feel like life is a burden and without purpose? I have people that care for me but feel so alone. I don’t want to have them worry about me. I don’t think I could ever actually commit suicide, but if I were to die I wouldn’t even care, it would probably be a burden lifted from my shoulders. Am I just hoping someone would notice and I am just looking for attention? I’m in college and no matter how many classes I take, or degrees I pursue, I can’t see myself doing anything I want to do in the future. Everyone says “Find your passion”, well that is easier said then done when I half-ass everything and am not particularly good at anything. I had to delete my social media because seeing all those “celebs” or even just other kids live a life full of happiness and not being lonely started to negatively affect my psyche even more. I feel like I don’t even have a personality because I just look for others recognition or am willing to do whatever with no care in the world. I’m not even religious anymore. Even now, I’m probably only posting this to crave more attention to temporarily give myself value. Life is just lonely.

"Is AP Lang really worth it? I'm a sophomore atm and need to decide what classes to take next year. I'm being recommended for AP Lang, however I'm not entirely sure I should take it.  It might just be the whole pandemic situation, but I'm really stressed right now with the classes I'm in already, which are all honors (except history, which I took over summer school) plus choir and Spanish.

I'm doing good in all my classes so far and I want to go to a good college, which is why I'm considering AP lang at all. But I'm scared it's going to be too hard.

Not only that, but  I plan to take AP Bio next year, which would require me to drop my favorite class, choir. Choir is really important to me and I'm very close with everyone there. I was originally planning to take English 3 over summer school, but now I'm not sure since I might take AP Lang.

I should also mention that I had an awful teacher for English in freshman year. I mean, she made me hate English and breakdown multiple times. She's also one of few AP Lang teachers.

Wow, lengthy. Sorry. Should I take English 3 over summer school for less stress and the ability to keep my favorite class, or should I drop choir and just suffer through AP Lang?

I kind of hoped that if it didn't work I would have some sort of epiphany, realize that i don't want to die, but i feel like I only became more sure of it. What's keeping me alive now is purely fear of failure and I'm getting to a point now where I just don't want to deal with anything anymore. When I get like that usually a fear of being found and sent to a mental hospital keeps me from holding on but I feel like I should just try as hard as I can to get something that'll kill me, even if it hurts. I dunno. 

I don't feel like I can get help, anyway. I don't know if it's irrational or not, but I honestly feel that asking for help and all that comes with that would end up being more of a monetary and mental burden on everyone else (and myself, obviously) than just dying. I used to think I would live longer and get help without bothering anyone with it, but as time has gone on I'm realizing that that's not really possible. I seem to get worse and worse very quickly.

Me and my boyfriend broke up a few months ago. Since then, we've stayed in touch. But the past month we've been arguing and things have been getting ugly. He has diagnosed depression. We've both been feeling suicidal, we've both been self harming. This morning he called me and we argued, I said I'd had enough, that I wanted to die, and I switched my phone off. The police arrived a few hours later since he called them to check on me. I was fine, I just needed a break from us arguing all the time.

He's doing really badly today. He's been self harming more than usual, he showed me a picture of what he did via text. We've called a few times today in between texting and if he gets frustrated on the phone or if I talk to much I can hear him punching things and hurting himself.

I want to call the police because he's really badly hurt, but he said that if I do that then he'll leave his house and go on the streets. He's blacked out a few times today because he's exhausted and in pain. He lives with his parents who aren't supportive and who don't know this is going on. I just want him to go to a&amp;e and get looked after or an assessment. I know how much they suck, I've had a few in the past, but I want him to be safe and I know the hospital can be a safe place.

I know I'm a suicidal person myself, but normally I can work through my feelings and that's how I cope. I've never seen him this bad, he lives in a different city so its not like I can visit him easily. I don't want to say the wrong thing in case he does attempt anything, I know he's attempted suicide multiple times in the past 4-6 weeks. He says he doesn't need help, he threatens that something bad will happen if I call the police. I feel trapped, I can't stop talking to him otherwise he'll self harm more or kill himself. I don't know if this is abusive. I don't know what to do. Please can someone just give their opinion or tell me what I should do",1

One of the most satisfying things is seeing a genuine feminist Itâ€™s so nice to see a feminist who believes everyone is equal but doesnâ€™t think all men are racists and bad. I mean I know there are lots of good feminist but all the ones you see in the front pages of social media seem to be saying that all men are nasty rapists who only think about sex. It just annoys me so much when you see the bad feminists that think women are superior like the people on r/thefairersex . I just want to say if you are a person who believes in gender equality (which is most people I think) you are a good person.,0

"TiredI’m tired of feeling this way. Feeling like a complete burden to everyone around me. I’m tired of trying to find someone who thinks I’m worth it. It doesn’t exist. It shouldn’t exist. I didn’t ask to be here, so why should I keep living when there is no point? We all just exist and then one day we die. That’s the only guarantee anyone has in life. Too many people are afraid of death, but to me, I could not see something more comforting. To not have the pressures of living, the stress of trying to make your way, not having to work meaningless jobs to make money that has absolutely no value except what we put on it. When you break everything down, there is absolutely nothing to this life except naivety and fear. Stopping it gives me the power. I’m tired of saying everything and nobody listening. Nobody cares.",1

My head hurts sooo bad from him hitting me over and over. I don’t get it. At least he gave me my razors back. I could do it. So easily. Not like many people would care. I know I can’t care anymore.

I could never relate to all you guys saying ""I feel so alone"" or ""I'm depressed"" and I always felt like an outsider in this sense. I mean, I have a great life and I don't like people complaining when they have a great life too!

I won't go into details here (simply because it's boring) but I consider the life I'm leading extremely lucky.

And suddenly it was like a ""welcome to the club"" moment. 

And I always ask myself, *what changed?* Is this a teenager phase that will pass soon? Or is this more... real?

I have no friends other than two guys I met online and never actually met. I can't find myself. I have a beautiful family: but it just feels like they don't know me. I'm constantly bored. And I go on walks everyday just to get out of this life - even if it's just for an hour. And seriously, why? As I said, I have a great life. So what changed?

"19 years old and it already feels like my life is over. i don’t know how much more of this i can take. (vent)it started with a diagnosis of depression and anxiety aged 14. then aspergers. then borderline personality disorder. then bulimia. in the middle of all this, my friend killed herself, i attempted suicide myself, i watched my family deteriorate before my very eyes and every single dream i tried to make come true seemed to slip between my fingers. i got so close to being the person i wanted to be - i left home, got a great job (which i hated, but ironically it was a job most people would die for) and i almost made it. but my brain said no, i fucked it all up, and i am left with nothing. i’ve pushed away everything i care about, and the people who are left resent me because i believe there’s no possible way they could fix this. i have no prospects. no future. no relationship. i can’t see a single reason to keep going in a world that would benefit from my death. all i do is cause pain to the people i love. and the most depressing part is, i keep pussying out. if i had the guts to actually end it all i would be long gone. i’m too pathetic to do everyone a favour and kill myself. i can’t do it. i’m so fucking weak. all i’m waiting for is that final push that sends me over the edge, so i can finally push the blade down and be happy. i know this is all horribly depressing, but i have nobody and i needed to vent about this shit.",1

"It seems overly dramatic but this is what I feel. I hate my entire being. And no, these feelings are not a result of me being on my period. This just happened and I don't know if I should be concerned or attempt to have a moment like this again.*I wrote this in a Word document as I was failing to make any progress on an assignment; in it I recount something which happened to me this Monday. Posted on* r/SuicideWatch *because I want with my entire being to be removed from this life; and I might just get the strength to do it myself. But I fear if I try I will fail as I do with everything else.*

I lay on my bed in pain, sitting in my own mess, when I would typically change my pad and take some ibuprofen, drink some tea. But I did not. I laid idle, making no attempt to soothe the pain which plagued me. I told myself, “this is all I deserve.” I accepted defeat. Said all the things which I hate about myself. Scolded myself for trying, for thinking I have or even deserve a chance at happiness. And when I finally got those thoughts through to myself, when I finally accepted my agony rather than fight against it, I fell asleep. It was perhaps the most comforted I have ever felt. The most complete, knowing there is nothing else to be done, that I may as well die laying there. And I thought of it. Dying of suffocation in my sleep didn’t sound too bad.

But as all good things are in my life, the relief was temporary.

Because here I am again, trying. Just barely, but trying. And it hurts. Because I’m lost and I know there’s no point, but I still try.

I wish to accept defeat again. To lie in the pain I deserve. And to fall asleep comforted by the peace of being done. Permanently.",1
"I peaked in high schoolI don't know how but I managed to fuck up with two different beautiful women who loved me.

Nothing bad by itself, but they shouldn't make up the core tenets of a person's life.

This is worded like shit but I'm about to pass out anyway so maybe by some miracle it'll help someone else out there put their situation into perspective. It's too late for me.",1

"I know whyI know why.

I know why you jumped off the water tower that night.

Your mom found you,

14 years old, with ""so much going for you"".

People keep saying they never saw it coming,

That they could never understand why you would do something so...

""*selfish*"",

They whisper behind the pews.

God, if they only knew,

What it felt like to drive your car, and know that with one jerk of the arm

All the pain could be gone.

Because I know why you did it.

I know you loved your mom.

You loved your sister and your dog and all the waterfalls that you'd photograph in front of,

But sometimes, that's not enough.

When you're always swelling,

Not with pride,

It's just your throat,

Never satisfied,

With living.

God, it hurts,

All that living.

When the pain keeps you awake at night,

And stops you from wanting to wake up,

Every morning.

But you still get up. 

So yes, I understand.

I know why you did, what you did.

But I know that I must keep on waking,

You even said, 

To ""live hard"".

"I keep repeating to myself, ""kill yourself, kill yourself, do it already"" Im ready to listen to my inner thoughts.Ive attempted in the past, but at the last moment either i live through it, just in a hellblaze of pain, becoming a even bigger failure, or my body stops me. My mind screams to do it, but sometimes, my body just stops me.

Sometimes my body will give up on life and ill lay there, wanting to shed a tear, yet i know no one will care, so i lay quietly, in the darkness for days on end. I try to drown out the voices with all i have left, music.
But recently, i dont care to listen to all i have. To do what has stuck with me for all my life. Im ready to listen to the voices. Im ready to listen to my inner shouts. If only i had easier access to guns, my life would be so much harder, but i dont. Instead, i have to go out in either a more painfull way.

"Committing suicide soonAfter much deliberation, I've decided upon a date and method to commit suicide. The events of each day are inexorably driving me to the edge, and I don't have much time left. 

My post/comment history perfectly chronicles my downward spiral. It's a window into a turbulent soul. 

Farewell, everyone. I hope you find peace and solace in your lives - I've scoured heaven and earth trying to find it, but to no avail.

"Subconscious urges?Hello SW. I was unsure of whether to post this on /r/anxiety or here because my situation has a lot of anxiety, but I figured the urges of suicide are a bit more urgent so I'll try here.

I'm a relatively new university student who has had moderate depression and severe GAD since about 7th grade. Over the years I've gotten better and better at dealing with my demons, particularly the suicidal tendencies. In the past week or so, though, the game has changed a bit. A while back if I was having thoughts of suicide there would be concrete reasons in my mind (say, a recently-failed relationship, my grandma dying, something), but now I've been having panic attacks related to my anxiety disorder and, directly after, very very strong urges of suicide. I wish I knew how to explain this to you guys without sounding crazy or like I'm lying, but after these panic attacks I have a hard time being self-aware. All I know is that I want to kill myself. There's no reasons in my mind as to why, but it's just my mind constantly tugging at my body to just *go through with it already.* The best way I can describe it is when you really have to use the bathroom, you don't really think about it, you just go unless you're unable to. Fortunately I have nothing in my dorm to kill myself with. By about an hour after my anxiety attacks the suicide thoughts are usually gone, and every time I ask myself why I wanted to do it so badly, I can't think of a solid reason. It's almost like I'm a different person entirely for that period of time.

Sorry to make this such a wall of word vomit; it's hard to describe all of this in a few sentences. Does anyone else ever have urges like these ones? Do they usually follow your anxiety/panic attacks (if you have them)?

I look forward to your help",1

"Go on or just turn myself off from some basic but essential human activities?Hey redditors, I’m starting to think that life isn’t for me (before I go on, I'm not trying to commit suicide, but gain advice and didn't what subreddit to choose so I went with this one, if anyone has suggestions to a subreddit pertaining to my situation then please refer me to them), I live in NJ where rent is high, jobs are scarce and hard to get, I live with a family that believes they are not racist when they are indeed racist and sexual victimize women and victimize victims in general, I’m poor like can’t make it on my own if I move out because as I said rents too damn high in the city, even if I was to get a roommate. Hostility against me in the household is high from my narcissistic police officer brother (btw he described a fight between two people as nigger gang vs the white gang, and sexual victimized a women the same night he was called to a scene, that’s the type of people that are protecting our rights and trying to keep peace within our communities I’m convinced), my crazy brother who swears he’s doing something with his life by sitting down on a ball all day playing guilty gears fighting game on his ps4, or using the home computer and going out at night to ride his bike, he’s 28 btw with a useless degree in a major that I can’t even remember, he’s not socialble, doesn’t have a job and believes he’s normal when he obviously needs help (hell I need professional help myself from living here all my life), and my shitty parents in which my dad is a terrible person like literally when he was driving me and my sister somewhere we were waiting at a traffic light near a well known good high school in the area and as we were waiting for the light to change a black guy minding his business crosses the road to get to the other side of the sidewalk and my dad shouts “get out of here filthy niger the projects isn’t that way”. Like I said some shitty people I had to grow up with and mind you my dads an Uber driver and he feels uncomfortable when black people enter his vehicle as he always voices his concerns at home loudly to my police officer brother in which he agrees with him. My mother, she just sucks, sides with my crazy brother on everything (not the police officer one) and thinks he’s the golden child, the only person I like in my household is my younger sister, she’s literally the only one besides me to have learned that the behavior of these people are wrong and idk about freedom to believe what you want if it’s going to condemn and dehumanize other people, it’s wrong and disgusting. I’m a 21 year old male, almost done with college, hopefully in 2019, but I don’t get opportunities for good employment, internships are highly competitive and other people who have experience gather already in my grade because they had family members hook them up are getting these internships easily. Makes me feel terrible, can’t even be given a chance to move out of my household and make a life of my own already, I have somewhat come to terms with my bad genetics as well (short torso, long legs, long arms suck, and are mechanically bad in the weight room, only advantage we get pretty much is the deadlift, otherwise extremely hard to pack on mass and doesn’t look very aesthetic, that and I’m poorly endowed like 4 inches long and 3 inch girth so it’s scary to try to get with a girl when practically everyone these days are hooking up and talking about their experiences with guys being big or average but still giving them a great time, plus a lot of people don’t want relationships in which I don’t blame them, times are changing and long term monogamy seems like it’s getting highly outdated now). Holy cow I have typed a lot already and haven’t even gotten everything down but this is a good gist of it, hard for me to make friends as well since I lack experience in partying although I do have friends, they all go to different colleges in different states and come back to NJ during vacations and such so not much to do until then, and people who are potential interests to become friends never have time to hang because jobs and priorities. Like seriously, how the FUCK is someone supposed to make it out here when they have been given bad opportunities growing up and their body doesn’t make it any better? I know I was born with bad genetics and born into a bad family which sucks, and everywhere now I’m supposed to accept the new anti hate movement when I know that although I do accept them, I won't be accepted back, I would be made into a mockery with girls probably saying poor guy hope things get better for him and ending it there. And don’t use old success stories, this is 2018, the old ways to get rich don’t and be happy go lucky fuck everyone attitude doesn’t apply anymore, everything requires a good degree of experience backed by a legitimately good employer to confirm this while having a fulfilling social life to be happy. What’s the point of living when not everyone can become part of the white collar job force when college and some professors, not all, say that it’s possible? Someone gotta do the dirty work amirite? Someone gotta suffer for others to succeed, ugh I feel oppressed like I can’t really change much and I have a limited amount of potential I can reach until I reach a pleateau that won’t allow me to proceed further because of life. I definitely do feel better venting all of this out though, if anyone was going to suggest taking therapy I’m too scared to do so as I couldn’t tell someone my problems with objective inadequacy ,any other advice will be welcomed!

anyway, point is, i feel like my family secretly hates who i am. an atheist AND i have a girlfriend? i’m a fucking disgrace. i came out when i was 12. i found out i liked girls when i was 12. i always DID, like i was flirty with friends since i was 8. i was always bullied for it and i cut myself and ripped up bibles and i was a mess. 
later though i got a little better, but with all of the memes and the jokes about gay people.. i dunno. it hurts. people wonder why we have pride parades and they hate them. they hate whenever we talk about who we are. they don’t understand why we do these things and it’s simply because we CAN. in other countries they are killed if someone simply questioned it. and that happens when people are atheist too. 

i just feel like i have no reason for being here. if i’m gay i’m automatically a freak. i’m automatically fucked up. i hate myself so much. i’m pushing my gf away atm. i dunno. i feel so stupid. and unloved by my family and friends. i lost all of my friends too. i kept one and she eventually mistreated me for other reasons and now we aren’t the same. 

other reasons i wanna die is, i was abused by my ex. he made everyone think i was crazy bc i told some people and i dunno. my counsin(s) molested me. two girls. one was when i was super younger, she was holding my tits when i was asleep and i bolted away and started crying. then her sister (a bigger girl) was kissing me while i was asleep and i woke and i was in shock. couldn’t or wouldn’t do anything bc she was kinda crushing me and i was so uncomfortable, it was awkward and i was scared. later i got up and she said, “you’re a bad kisser when you’re sleeping.” :( had to pick out pieces of fucking gum that she’d left in my mouth. 

a guy also proceeded to have sex with me after i told him no. i cried, and pretended i liked it. i was again... scared. i’ve always been sexually harassed and i just dealt with it. i told myself before if i ever got raped, just pretend you like it and maybe they won’t hurt you. but now i realized i should have done something. 

my ex (abusive one) coerced me into sex by saying if i didn’t, then he’d kick me out of his house. i didn’t have a car. in my mind my friend probably wouldn’t have came and got me. i was 20 so mins away and she was a new driver. so i did, and i was sobbing loudly and he finished. he also kidnapped my dog and was threatening to kill her. i was devastated. he returned her at the end of my neighborhood and i had to listen for her barks to find her. his mom blamed me. 

i also have had men i didn’t know threaten me with guns. took ‘em out and the people i was with diffused the situations. 

anyways, i’m just traumatize by my entire life and i don’t know what to do. i’m only 18. i feel like if my life is gonna be this way forever, i don’t want to live it. i hated taking meds. i slept all damn day every day and i was just a terrible human. i still am, but it’s less bad. idk. i was kinda doing drugs a lot when i was with the abuser and i want to turn to them again to ease the pain. 

but anyway, i just wanted to vent. 

TL;DR: i want to kill myself because my family secretly hates me, i was raped? (not sure if that’s what it’s considered), molested by two of my girl cousins in my sleep (years apart), abused by my ex (in therapy now bc of it, or was), traumatizing experience with guns (scared to go out, scared of people), i don’t wanna be bi because i feel like it’s better to be dead than gay (ashamed of myself for liking women).",1
"16 year old sister has been depressed for some time, seriously considering suicide. What can I do?Hello all. I am an 18 year old male heading into my sophomore year of college. My sister has been depressed for a long while. She started secretly cutting herself at the age of 14. My mom has many health problems (which are completely out of her control, ie- she could not have prevented them by certain behavior). So she has been in and out of the hospital since my sister was a kid. This has influenced her in many ways.

I am home for the summer, and while my sister was away, I found a video on her computer from last month called Suicide.avi. In the video she was crying and saying how tired she is of everything. Of people hurting her and her hurting other people. This makes me very nervous

I know she has attempted to OD before, but was found and taken to the hospital. She goes to regular therapy and is on prozac (I believe). She has expressed depressive and suicidal thoughts to me before (how she thinks of driving off of the bridge near our home almost daily).

I have an older brother, and we have both gone through teenage depression. My brother and I have both had suicidal thoughts. I think many (most) teenagers do. 

I have tried communicating to her that things get better, but she doesn't seem to want to help herself. She dates guys she knows sheshouldn't (leading to more emotional distress) and 'forgets' to take her medicine

Apparently, every night, our 8 year old sister asks my mother ""what if ____ kills herself tonight?""

tl-dr: 16 year old sister is suicidal. It sort of runs in the family. What do I do?",1

There’s no way we’re the only ones here and we’re just so small and little that nothing we do ever matters. And that’s what makes it hard, not that I’m sad or I wanna die but just the fact that all our stresses and fears are stupid, not just that but  our whole existence is such a small insignificant period in an insanely large time line. We’ll be here and gone before we know anything. I can strive my whole life to my successful and happy and on the off chance I do what then? I get to have the perfect family and be comfortable with my money? We have to give up our priceless time in order to make money. Something made by us that has divided us unlike anything else. Our emotions aren’t important at all. So why am I having these shitty emotions all the time when I’m significant. It pisses me the fuck off when I think about it, and sadly, it’s all I think about. I look at myself in the mirror and I see nothing. I look at what I own and I see nothing. I try to look in the future and picture myself and I can see nothing. I’ve lost interest in anything I have ever loved. I never missed a ball game a few years ago and now I can’t sit through one without falling asleep.

"I can't even sleep anymore; I feel ever so close to ending it right now.I've been depressed for around six years now, since I was twelve and roughly around the time I found out I was gay. 

As the years have passed, it has just gotten worse; at this point all I feel is extreme anger, sadness, apathy and deep envy. I can't *sleep* anymore unless I've been up for twenty hours or more; when I try to sleep, or my mind isn't focusing very hard on something, my mind races *constantly*, going from one subject to another (religion, politics, history, medicine, bad life experiences, **so** many mistakes, envy, etc), so much so that my headaches are near-constant.

A couple months ago, just before I turned eighteen, I had to leave home with my family to move to a *very* small roadside town in the south. Ever since, my depression has gotten *very* much worse; now it is even harder to get to sleep, my mind races even more and I am just plain miserable. I simply cannot stand this place, everyone here acts like they want to slit my throat as soon as they hear my northern accent; everything is different (hell, their *crosswalks* are different). I miss my home and what few friends I had so fucking much; it's hard to not think of it, and even harder to not cry over it.

In a couple days I'll be getting my change of address so I can get an ID and start looking for work; I am agonizing over it since there are so few jobs in this small town, if I fuck up I could be stuck here even longer. I *need* out of this god forsaken hell hole.

---

Because of this move I've been royally fucked over; I was so close to finishing my third year of high school, but now I've lost an entire semester (and over 3/4 a quarter of hard work) *and* am considered a *year* behind. Back home, should I have passed this semester, I'd only need one quarter to finish high school. Now I have to go to a small town high school filled with hicks *and* graduate with people I don't know or like.

Even after high school, though, I don't know what to do from there; I am stuck here for at least fifteen more months to save up the money to move, and I don't know how or where to move to. With my marks, I can't go to college, but I wanted to try to get my RNC, but it is entirely impossible to work *and* go to college here since the closest college is over an hour away (hell, the closest *Starbucks* is two hours away); I wanted to move to Washington, but I don't know how to move across the states, nor how I could juggle full time work *and* trying to go to college.



I don't know what to do; my life is a wreck. I can't take another month here, let alone two more years just for the *chance* to move. Even then, my life will be filled with even more hardship; I've been poor my entire life, and now I am looking at complete poverty once again.


I was told my entire life that hard work would get you everywhere, but everything I've been through the past four years has proven that to be the largest amount of **horeshit** ever spoken.

"27 - Thoughts?I'm a male I'm 27 and I've done drugs in the past 24 hours. Now I sit back down at my computer, at my parents house, and start on my second beer. I was a hopeful lad, great at baseball and a seeming knack for ""just getting it"". I counted the girls that liked me on my fingers while taking a poop. That was like 3rd grade. 

I had orthodontics for 10 years and even though I didn't decide for myself that I wanted to do the treatment, or perform the treatment, I feel the blame for the negative results and  think the whole thing genuinely fucked up my life. I feel the blame for the process because to some degree or another I do feel that we are responsible for ""our cards"". Call it Karma. I still want to blame others. I should have had better follow-up and guidance during the orthodontic process. After all, I started when I was 8. 

What went wrong was that I was a boy. I didn't like to take showers and I didn't like to wear fucking headgear or retainers at night - so I didn't and being young, what could go wrong? Mistake. 

My transition to my freshman year of college was greeted by a lovely surprise. Because of my orthodontics and sparse retainer use, the way my teeth came together shifted and started wreaking havoc with how I hold my jaw. My jaw started jutting forward producing an underbite, which was new to me. Picture this - Here I am freshman year of college, supposedly the most socially engaging and fun years of my life, and I have a lower jaw that's growing like Pinocchio. 

I totally freaked and even though I made attempts at being social, it never came naturally and increasing jaw tension and attention on the jaw only made matters worse.  At this point I started becoming increasingly reclusive. All social situations were an uphill battle and subconsciously I couldn't wait to get out of them. I know as a culture we're socially stunted - my big thing is that I'm special because I really had it bad with this. I started to recognize that every conversation I started to have turned into me introspectively judging how my jaw looks to that person. This feedback loop of increasing attention to that region and genuine orthodontic fuck-up, only increased my jaw tension.

I turned to Buddhism and meditation. After finishing college I started living at Buddhist monasteries. There wasn't much responsibility, and there wasn't much social interaction, but enough to suffice to the idea of being part of something and moving forward. I did this for a few years and became quite a skilled meditator because I was disciplined and motivated enough to only escape to meditation - not to videogames and other stuff (porn). Because I grew up in an upper-middle class family the blueprint of being successful is as-good-as hardwired into me. I needed to prove to my family and friends that I could make it, and I needed to be good at meditation because it was/is the only thing I have faith that has genuinely produced earnest positivity in human beings. Well this push/pull of western and eastern ideology in your mid-twenties is probably going to be a shit-show and I haven't proved any different. I went as far as becoming a monk for a year and have lived in monasteries for 2.5 years out of the 4 since I have graduated. The other time I spent hiking the Appalachian Trail, and moving to DC - failing pretty badly at getting off the ground in job or social aspects. 

Now I'm 27 and feel like I'm being spoon fed a hot coal of bitter medicine. Jaw problems aren't just jaw problems. Our teeth and bite have a whole shit-load to do with how the neck and spine co-operate with eachother. When things are out of whack with your bite, it can throw the entire spinal chain off in ways we don't really understand yet. The body is an unbelievably complex and connected machine. This has only increased my jaw tension and I had an X-ray done for confirmed scoliosis in my back. I'm 27, and the bitter medicine is that barring a miracle, I'm not turning this physical decline around. That's the gut punch. Ever since 20 I've always thought that I'd get through this and be able to communicate and socialize and get pretty girls and do all the things that I was promised... That's never going to happen, and in all likelihood my body is only going to turn more and more into a prison. 

I don't have any trade skills. I don't socialize. It just seems bleak when I put it down and lay the facts out. I've been home at my parents for over a month now and my habits are vaporizing. I'm lost, I'm paranoid, I'm unwilling to try new things. I can't go forward, I can't go backwards, and I can't stand still.

"I wish there were hope left.I apologize this post may be long.

I just turned 23. I suffer from, post traumatic stress disorder, dissociative identity disorder, major depressive disorder, severe anxiety, severe nightmares, night terrors, and sever depression. They run my life. They are causes to why I have had a damn near impossible time making friends, interacting with others and had a mind that has been ripping itself apart. I have been suicidal since I was 7 years old. I have dealt with it on my mind, in my heart, in my dreams, anywhere. I have had no peace from it. It is all from myself. Ripping and taring myself apart and I cannot control it. No matter what I do I am falling apart. I have always been worse alone. The past few months I have been loosing touch with reality. It could be from the loneliness, the night mares and how real there are to the damage of everything finally getting to me. 

Suicide is on my mind and has been for over 16 years now. Most of the time it has never really been a threat. Just that pestering issue in the back of the mind. But now I cannot shut it off. It is in the front of the mind. I feel no reason to live. No reason to move forth. My health and my disabilities will keep me from ever working full time. My family has always shown me what a burden I am, my physical health is deteriorating and I am always in such deep and emotional pain. Then I am alone. A friend helps but it puts so much stress on them and they never stay. And it cuts deep because I am what I am. I cannot control that. I cannot be the friend they need/want. Only myself. And all the pain I go through gets to them. The closer someone gets the more they see and feel. And the more they want to leave. In my entire life I have only ever had 4 people I could call friend. Lately I lost the one that meant the most to me. I saw how much I hurt my friend. And I could not stop it. I drove away the one good thing I had in my life and I have no idea to apologize for that. I have no idea how to say what I need to say. I am back to being alone. 

I can go on and on about why I cannot take my life, all the disorders, all the health issues, being so alone, being the thing taring myself apart, having no hope, unable to change a thing, nightmares. Literally everything is a never ending torment. On the outside most people never know or see. Only the people I get close to see that. What people see on the outside is something different and they want to hurt it. Even as an adult I get bullied for what I am. I am sick and tired of hearing things will get better. I have tried to make things better, waited for things to get better, done anything and everything. They only get worse and they ware me down. I have been on most medication. They do not help me and I literally get every side effect to them. I have tried therapists. Some just want your money, are stupid but want to help, do not know how to help. in my life I have been asked by therapists, ""why have you not killed yourself"" ""How have you not done drugs"". And I have been to the top professionals in my area. I have been fighting this all my life. Covered all my bases. What I need is a miracle but those things do not exist. I have been doing this alone most of my life. The more and more I tried the less hope I had. Things I have fought for are, to be normal, self sufficient, friends, love. I have failed all 4. I can never be normal as I am not so what society is so how will I ever blend it or make friends. I cannot be self sufficient from my health and disorders because there is no beating them only coping which I cannot do anymore. I cannot ever make friends because I honestly have no idea how to and the few I have ever been lucky enough to make leave eventually. And love will never happen. Love was the thing I wanted most. because i have never had it or felt it. not even from family. but to have love you have to have a friend. and once past friend you have to get close. Well if someone gets close they feel the pain. Who wants to love and care for someone who is broken with little to nothing to offer.

I have been warn down to the point there literally is nothing left. You can name about anything and I have been through it or known someone who has. And the way my mind works is I see my memories all day long. I see my entire life every day. And I have others memories. I remember all the things people have told me and built memories of them. So every day I relive the people I have lost. some to health, some to suicide, some to abandonment. My mind tortures itself by showing me all of this and I cannot shut it off. It takes about all the energy I have to barely function and most days I cannot even do that right. I fight the urge not to breakdown and just cry every day. I just do not have the energy to keep pretending things are okay. the energy to put things back together. I just cannot. 

I have tried all the possibilities of help I could think of, from medicine, therapists, institute, friends, meditation, writing, people with some issues like myself, you name it I have tried it. None of it helps or even works anymore. I feel like I have a broken mind and broken heart. They cannot be fixed. I have the hardest time describing what I go through and 99% of people who say they understand know nothing of the sort. because they do not know what it is like to be tortured every day of your life. You cannot shut it off and it invades my dreams. 

A long time ago I saw this all as an issue and fought so hard for help. but I found no help. I knew it was going to be a struggle and I had to beat it. My mentality was about beating it. but you can only cope with it. How can you cope with something like this tho? Nightmares, a day full of flashbacks, terrible memories, all the people you have lost, a body always in physical pain because of neurological issues, severe food allergies to everything, a mind breaking itself, non stop headaches and just so much more. How can you be okay with living with that the rest of your life alone? 

I want nothing more then to end things. But I do not have the will. I cannot ever bring myself to do it. but at this point it is all I have left and I fear I will run out soon. (my mind works on auto pilot when debating something) I fear that in the end of the debate the answer with just be to give up. I know I cannot survive the way I am. But I do not know how to change anything. I cannot endure this life anymore. I have no hope left. I dont want to be so alone. I just want to be free. 

I do not know anymore...

I apologize for the length. I just do not know what to do anymore. I know I probably did not make much sense. Most of the time I am in my own world and I am not the best at interpreting it. ",1

This last christmas I spent it with my grandparents and my grandpa had just bought a new handgun, and I just wanted my mind to shut the fuck up and be quiet, so I loaded two rounds (I've heard of people living through one shot and being a vegetable forever so I wanted to make sure I had backup) put it up to my head and nothing. I struggled with it for another 10 minutes then just gave it up. Turns out the guy he bought it from had cleaned it prior and forgot to put the firing pin back in. I checked myself into the emergency mental health clinic. It was the first time I ever sought help for my problems. In my house my father frowned on getting mental help, as he used to say ""It ain't the touchy feely 80s anymore son, noone gives a shit if you don't feel good."" I spent 11 days in inpatient where I met in groups, talked to a doc daily and generally felt good. I miss it there, the health techs, nurses, and groups were full of nice people who cared. Anyway it's been about a week and a half since I left, and I'm struggling to make it again. I'm being chapter-ed from the Army, under honorable conditions, and am returning home to my parents. I promised I wouldn't hurt myself to myself, and people who care about me, but here I am burning myself again. I have OCD with ruminations and intrusive thoughts and find myself on the floor gripped with thoughts of sexually assaulting people, crippling and terrifying because I have so much respect for people, especially women. And these intrusive thoughts  make it feel like this is myself wanting to do this and by burning myself brings me out of my mental pain and back into the physical world of pain which at least I can understand. I feel like I need someone to be happy. It's the only thing that makes me feel happy. I know you're not supposed to do that, but nothing else, none of the hobbies, jobs or ways to waste time compare to making someone else smile. I just want someone to tell me that they're there for me, and try to make me smile. I don't want to think about all the things that haunt me. My childhood full of physical and verbal abuse from students and teachers. My next door neighbor raping me in a piece of shit ford explorer on blocks in his front yard to the soundtrack slim shady. My fiancee that left me after 6 years of dating when she was pregnant and 2000 miles away over the phone. My best friend Ben hanging himself last year and his dad att the funeral telling me all he wanted to do his last 2 weeks of life was get in contact with me but I was too busy being a piece of shit wasting my life partying. Brooke, and her lies after finally thinking I could be happy again. I just want to be a kind, happy, nice man with a nice wife who's clingy and needy like I am. I just want to be ok.",1

"Why am I still aliveWhy am I in so much pain?
Why do I let myself get like this?

Today I decided that nothing is worth living for  my mom has been gone for almost two years and I don't know what to do I can't cry I can do anything I feel so num my brain and heart still believe she's still alive when I know she's gone I'm wanting to go back to the hospital but people think it's something else wrong no its my meds I want to die I want to cut till I can't cut anymore what's something that I can do because right now there's nothing because I live in a damn homeless shelter at m trying to save up money and I can't do anything please 
JUST LET ME DIE!!",1
"What am I missing?I was about to write ""I hope I am missing something"" as the title, but that would be wrong, I am not 'hoping' per se, more like I'm checking one more time if I left the stove on before I leave.

There's nothing for me in here, I hold very little value for money, belongings, social status. And people are worthless to me because they value the aforementioned, are making themselves about those and from those. I am afraid that if I explain myself or my views fully, I'll infect someone else with this, but be warned: I'll elaborate and will tell my views if asked, they might seem not that bad at first or for a few years, but it's a seed that grows slowly. So don't be arrogant about it: it's nothing special, it's not a big secret and that's the twist.

Anyway.. There's just no point going on, there's nothing here for me that I can see. To me life seems to be just a waiting place for death, to keep yourself busy so death can surprise you. But how to keep yourself busy I nothing holds meaning to me? I can't get attached to things that disappear eventually, I am too emotional for that. My memories of the most beautiful, wonderful and magnificent people I have met are torturing me as it is. And I don't want any more pain. The most meaningful things hurt the most, and that's why I don't want them, because the pain is always the last thing of that deal. That's what I am left with. 

And if I continue regardless, it will eventually lead me to the same conclusion: the pain kills me. Life is so beautiful that it kills me. So why die in pain, when it is possible to die without it? If I don't take life to my heart, then there's no point continuing either, because I'm holding back; nothing is that important to me; it's meaningless.

So here's why I am writing this: is something I am missing, before I make the biggest decision I can ever make? An unchecked stove somewhere? If so, where should I look for it when I am somewhat aware of this:
&gt;A Sioux creation story says that long ago the Creator gathered all of Creation and said, ""I want to hide something from the humans until they are ready for it. It is the realization that they create their own reality.""

&gt;The eagle said, ""Give it to me, I will take it to the moon.""

&gt;The Creator said, ""No. One day they will go there and find it.""

&gt;The salmon said, ""I will bury it on the bottom of the ocean.""

&gt;""No. They will go there too.""

&gt;The buffalo said, ""I will bury it on the Great Plains.""

&gt;The Creator said, ""They will cut into the skin of the Earth and find it even there.""

&gt;Grandmother Mole, who lives in the breast of Mother Earth, and who has no physical eyes but sees with spiritual eyes, said, ""Put it inside of them.""

&gt;And the Creator said, ""It is done.""

Also this might be a **long** conversation or the shortest ever, with no reply. So if you are not up to ""the challenge"" help someone else, your words may be wasted on me. Speak from the heart and if nothing comes up, then continue on it's not your fight. Truth should be effortless. But don't be intimidated, your words can make a difference, who knows it can be as little as ""Dude, you forgot to drink your coffee"" and then it all dawns on me lol.. no promises though.. don't beat yourself up.. but anyway, I wanna go, so did leave something undone? Something worth checking out? Inb4 ur lyfe, AC movie, Rogue one movie, and the year 2017

"Thoughts please ?I'm 21
I want to have the option to impulsively kill myself when I get in a certain state of mind. I think like this occasionally.

Theres alot of stress pushed back in my mind involving my studies and morality about our purpose here and how I owe it to the world to live a certain  way.
When I start to really think about life it seems hard to do what I know is right.
I can hear myself burying down the right decisions and it's easy. 
I know I'm a piece of shit, theres so much I should and shouldnt be doing.
It feels too late to change.
It feels too easy to just ""get by"" like I believe most people might.
Knowing ""everything works out in the end is exactly the problem""
I think it might be honourable to kill myself rather than have my life piss by repeating itself meaninglessly.
It really feels all or nothing sometimes.

Does anybody here think like this and could share their thoughts ?",1

"I think I might be done soon.It's just starting to become too much. Within the last few years, more like ten, I just feel like noone understands me and its time for me to just go. I don't know if that means to cut everyone out of my life and move far away, or to just end my life. But ending my life is so much simpler than packing and explaining why noone will be able to talk to me or why I have decided what I have. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm just lost and feel like venting so I apologize for the wall of text you are about to read if you do. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have CPTSD that was caused by long term abuse by a family member. This was sexual, physical, and emotional. Long term is related to 3-5 years, I cannot remember exact dates or age but I know it happened for a long time, everyday, and it has destroyed my adult self. I was medicating myself with marijuana illegally and when I got into trouble I had this ""awakening"" or whatever and started to stay away from it. The downside of medicating yourself is that the emotions or feelings that you would have normally felt was all suppressed by the intoxicating effects of happiness from the weed. Someone with my mental health has found this relief very addictive since it took me away from my troubles or struggles or things that I was just tired of handling. 

&amp;#x200B;

Once I stopped smoking weed, all of the suppression started to surface, like anger. I am a calm person, my CPTSD has me locked into a shell or commonly known as dissocialization. Basically, dissocialization makes the person numb to their surroundings, sensory. Noises sounds like you are under water and you cannot focus, and when you do, the other background noise becomes overriding, and say that someone tries to talk to you, you kind of freak out on them such as yelling or getting agitated or such. 

These type of feelings were new to me since I had stopped smoking weed. And when I get the most perfect GF, she experiences this bad side of me. I lied to her about smoking weed, and when she found out she asked me to stop, so I did and that's when a lot of the problems started. We started fighting and that was the worst cause I have never fought before. Then one day she smacked me. And it had put me in this stage of almost blackout and I smacked back. It was horrible. Please don't give me a hate speech about this, and judge me for it, I didn't mean for it to happen but it was a trigger to my CPTSD and I had lost function of thinking before action and I had reacted. I know it wasn't hard, I apologized and she even said it wasn't hard and that it just startled her. But it startled me to because I am a firm believer in men should not hit women and I had just broken it. 

&amp;#x200B;

We talked about my CPTSD and I explained everything that I was going through. She had asked me to go to a therapist and my reaction to it was why would I want to talk about rape to a stranger when it was hard enough trying to talk to you about it. Not just one rape, years worth of rape, not by a stranger but by a family member. And the thing is, is at this time there was no such thing as a boy getting raped or at least not talked about. Like if it happens, then a boy should just keep his mouth closed about it, and that's exactly what I was taught by my family. Like that trauma doesn't matter to a boy. It's just all effed up.  So anyways, I decided the therapist and told her my reasons and she insisted that I go, and every fight this was brought up. How me and my ""abuser"" should just go F\*\*\* each other using perfume (thats how it happened) and it's a constant trigger. 

&amp;#x200B;

So here we are talking about triggers, and you remember what happened with the first trigger, so know you probably want to ask if have I hit her more than once. Yes, I have. Because of verbal? No. All my physical abuse towards her was caused by physical abuse towards me. There was once that I saw her left leg jump up, almost like she was going to knee me in my groin, and in response, I had kicked her leg. If you are a guy, you know if a girl is going to knee you, you lift your leg in a way to cover yourself. My leg did that but mine reacted in a different way and made contact. Did it hurt her, yes it did and I spent the whole weekend holding and crying with her trying to apologize. Again, this was horrible and this is why I remember details about it. If I didn't care then I wouldn't remember. So we talked about seeing a therapist and I agreed. 

&amp;#x200B;

I started talking about it, about my life, about everything and I was remembering a lot more, and it hurt more and it devastated me more. I became more agitated more easily, angry that with the ten years of knowing this girl, she never had a job, nor wanted to help me financially at all. Never helped with laundry, never did anything to support me. She ended up fighting with me and threw urine on me. Pulled down her pants, cupped her hand, urinated, and threw it in my face. Practically because I wanted to go to sleep. Now I know what your thinking, but I'm actually proud of this knowing that my emotions have just effed with me when it comes to this girl. But I actually laughed and did nothing. I wasn't mad about it. 

&amp;#x200B;

A few months later, she threatened suicide. She knows how I feel about it and its nothing but negative. Like, with all the stuff that I've been through, what makes you feel like you need to kill yourself? Stuff like that, that is how I think. It's like, I was raped 100s of times, beaten thousands of times, and verbally assualted millions and you want the easy way out? She has done this a lot throughout our relationship and at first I was like don't do it, you are worth more than that, and after the 6th or 7th time it was more like, stop saying that sh\*\*. Well again, months later she threatened it and ran into the bathroom. This was a scare tactic cause thats just how she plays her game, been through it 100s of times with her at this point and I just lost it. I gave it back to her. I pretended to swallow a 500 count of IBu and she called the cops on me. At that point, everything checked out that I was okay but they sent her to the mental hospital for having razor indents on her skin where she tried to cut. I moved back home. 

&amp;#x200B;

We talked and I would visit her, and she ends up pregnant. After 10 years, she ends up pregnant with what I think is my child. And throughout this whole thing, she fights with me about moving back. I tell her no. My mom is sick, she weighed 70 pounds and we had her gain to over 150. And it was just a constant fight about moving and I would continue to say no because of my mom. Well my mom ended up having a stroke and she still asked when I was moving. While my mom is locked in a coma, can't breath on her own, she wants to talk about moving? I found it very disrespectful for the situation. Well, short story, my mom passed and she continued to asked when I was moving. But I can't support a move because I had just spent 9+ thousand dollars on a funeral because none of that was arranged. 

&amp;#x200B;

Baby is born. I show up and everything is great but I forget to sign the birth cert. And I brought it up a few days later after I get back home and she gets back home and she said that she told the hospital that I was a friend and not the father so that I wouldn't be able to sign. I agreed that the baby could keep her last name, even though its against almost everything I believe in, I agreed on not going to court, I agreed on everything that she asked, even no visitation since we live in different states. But not signing the birth cert on a child? That's like a last straw for me. She agitates my CPTSD with comments about it, agitates fights, constantly downs me, then says that I can't be on the birth cert. I'm devastated. And now, I'm writing this because I really feel like its the end. My family wants me to fight for custody now, and I'm against taking children away from moms but they are being very hateful about my decision and are threatening CS to get involved resulting in the child not being in either arms. Its like wtf. So I'm thinking, if I'm out of the picture, what fuel do they have? They can't hurt my boy, I don't have to worry about a name, the mother gets what she wants, everyone wins, and I just sleep for a long time. Which I like sleeping, its like my most favorite time because I can be whoever I want to be and do whatever I want to do. And when I'm awake, I have to deal with this sh\*\*, people playing with my mental condition and not caring knowing that it exists. Taking advantage of me because I have a huge heart.  But basically at this point, fuck it, I'm done you know?

&amp;#x200B;

Well thats the story and I needed to get that off my chest. 

&amp;#x200B;

If you were wondering and still pondering about my abusiveness. It's been close to 4 years since I have touched her in a negative way and I have been around her a lot since then. My therapy ended up helping my violent tendencies and they started to become more under control. Also I've been using CBD oil to help with my disorder. Please don't judge me for it, I was just in a bad spot and needed help but not wanting it. Bothers me a lot :/ ",1

If you do not know, a guy hug is when you and the person you are hugging handshake, pull yourselves to each other, and pat the other guys back twice. I did that, and this girl and her group of friends called me and my boy gay. That same girl is the one who calls other girls sexy and hot in the Instagram comments.

"Self sabotaging myself, now coming to a point where it's too much.For as long as I can remember I have been having a hard time to do things. No ambitions, and no drive. I've contemplated suicide, but it just seemed like too much work. I never realized this was a mild form of depression until I talked to a doctor about it. At the time I decided not to get officially diagnosed because of the potential future career consequences that an official diagnoses entails. 

Offer high school i traveled for a few years, then I come back home and started taking out student loans. I have been going to university for the past six years, and although I really enjoyed going to classes I have not been doing so good. I started out strong, getting about 70% average, but now on my last year I'm at 52%. If i didn't already have enough credits to graduate this May, the university would have kicked me out for a year due to academic probation. 

It just seems like every time I decide to do something productive and set mind to task, I inadvertently turn around and do something worse. 

For ex, I decide to get up early, and end up staying in bed until 2pm the next day. Or I go to library to do homework, and end up doing anything but that (like browsing reddit)


Now, graduate or not, I'm fucked. In the past 6 years that I have been in uni, I have only been watching tv and playing video games. No social life or social skills (literarily, not even one friend. Video games and books have always been my entertainment, so while in theory, having friends sounds nice, it has always seemed like a struggle and too much work even maintaining 1 friend), 80k in debt, and no money to get a place once I move out of residence. 

Now, suicide does not seem like too much of a hassle. I just don't know where to go from here. It fucking sucks. 

**i am not just ""suddenly"" feeling suicidal because I hit a bump on the road**. It is something that has always been in the back of my mind, but now it just seems like it is constantly in my mind.

I was able to keep afloat and hold down a job and such, but the last year and a half have been jobless for me. I havenâ€™t been able to work. But I also canâ€™t get disability. I feel like Iâ€™m letting everyone down, including myself. I was fairly successful before it got worse to where I couldnâ€™t work.

Iâ€™ve been with my girl for over five years. We own our own home. We have a good life. Relatively little to stress about. 

But Iâ€™m unable to bring myself to clean. To walk the dog. To bathe. I feel like I canâ€™t do a thing. And I am a person that used to run on determination and motivation. But now... Iâ€™m just eating like shit, passive aggressively killing myself by not taking care of myself. I wish my doctor gave me anti anxiety meds a while back because it wouldâ€™ve helped a lot. And even though I have no history of addiction, neither of my doctors felt like giving me something for my sudden anxiety episodes.

I donâ€™t know where Iâ€™m going with this. But I think about suicide nearly everyday. Prozac felt like it was starting to work. But then I reverted back to my old ways.

Im also afraid of pain. If It didnt hurt i would do It sooner. My other option is jump from a building but im so scary of high. How effective is to cut ourselves? What would you do If you have 2 months of life?,1

"Secrets shall be revealed here today people ask how I got so much karma with such a low age account so heres the secret

Go to r/pics or r/PoliticalHumor and post a picture of a minority (Eg Homeless, black, mexican) making a statement against trump, this statement can be on twitter ([I used this one](https://i.redd.it/46m6mwqavft41.png)) You cannot use twitter on r/pics so for this sub you use protest signs or as I used a homeless sign, before you do this ensure they cant check your profile and see you are active on a sub like r/PoliticalCompassMemes but if some one notices and comments then just ignore it and dont even defend your self (I made this mistake and am now perma banned from pics)

If you have done all this right then you should have a post in hot with some awards, if this doesn't work the first time repeat until it does because eventually it will. 

You can also use r/politics and find a headline about something dumb republicans did but this sub has an account age time

You may also use r/blackpeopletwitter and find a black guy making fun of trump, this one will also usually work

And once you have gotten all that karma and awards you delete that shit so it doesn't stain your account and you can easily do it again, have fun!",0

"What now... can't trust the health system... can't trust myself... is it worth it?Recently diagnosed with Bipolar... or not?  I saw a psychiatrist who is supposed to be helping me along the way and monitoring my medication; however, he instead stated that his opinion was that I do not have bipolar and I should stop taking my meds.  I don't know how to feel about anything.  I don't know anything.  I finally accepted that the reason for all my mistakes/emotions/mental state was the bipolar and I thought the meds and a better changed lifestyle would help everything.  But having this other professional telling me not to take the meds it puts me right back at square one.  If it isn't bipolar, then I guess that just makes me a fucked up burden on everyone.   An 11 month wait into a program for help, counsellor doesn't know, first psychiatrist thinks I am bipolar, second doesn't.  How do you move forward when everything seems to be falling apart? ",1

"How I want To DieMy name's Daniel, I'm a junior in high school.

I've wanted to die my whole life, but I've always been scared of dying alone and the pain that comes along with suicide. Last night I walked to some woods near my house with a knife and had planned on slitting my wrist/neck, but I couldn't do it. Now I know exactly how I want to die. I plan on using Nembutal or a similar substance to fall asleep and die at school, because I know I won't be as afraid of death if there are others around me. I want to do this during second period, where I'm an aid for an AP Psych class. The way I imagine it going down is as follows:

I consume my cocktail of Nembutal and alcohol in class, and then announce to the class what I've done and why I did it there and not at home, apologize for burdening them and then ask someone to hold my hand as I die, which hopefully someone will. If all goes as planned, I'll be unconscious before paramedics arrive, and they won't have time to save me, and even if they try I'll be asleep so I won't feel whatever they do, so my final waking moments will be holding someone's hand before I fall asleep.

It'd be a lot less scary for me that way, and if my classmates decide to show concern for me in my last moments, I'll even feel cared for, so I'll die happy.

Lastly, I'm sorry for posting this. I know so many people post here who are probably more in need than I, and nobody likes reading these things anyhow, so sorry you had to read all that.",1

I tryed a while ago but about 12 pills in I felt sick and puked everywhere. I wish my mum didn't care about me so I could leave alot more easyer. My mum has cares and spent so much on me and in return iv given her a fat, ugly, dumb, stuped and anyoing son. I came out to some people about it at school and now I'm werid to them. I just want to leave this shitey world. Right now I fell so much gult for stuff iv done. I can't sleep or anything, hopefully I will get hit by a bus or shot tomorrow.",1
"I need to go to the hospital but it's just going to fuck everything upI can't stand the thought of my dad knowing I'm going back to the hospital. When I close my eyes all I can see is the look on his face all of those years ago when the police showed up because I called a suicide hotline and they forced me to go with them to the ward. The police have showed up twice in the past two weeks, once because I told my therapist I wanted to die and the second time because my friend found out that I had something with me that I was going to OD on. My dad doesn't know. I hope he never does. I know I need to go to the hospital but I'm on his insurance plan so it's not like I can hide it forever. I don't want to hurt him again. I hurt people enough already and I can't keep hurting them. 

Last night I had a breakdown and hung out with the guy I've stupidly fallen for. I'm obsessed with him in the most unhealthy possible way and I hate myself for it. He hasn't replied to my texts in an hour and it's making me so depressed. My emotions shouldn't be tied to how he feels about me. Last night he noticed some scabs on my wrist from a little bit ago. Nothing bad because I threw away my blades about a month ago after he convinced me so I didn't have anything that sharp, but he got sad. Later that night I ordered a 100 pack of razors from Amazon because I don't even have the energy to walk to the store to buy myself something to hurt myself with. He told me it wouldn't fix anything and I told him it always fixes things. That's when he stopped replying.

I got a call from someone at my school today saying they reviewed the police report from the most recent time mentioning that they confiscated ""a chemical bought online."" They didn't say what it was in the police report and now the school is threatening disciplinary action if this ever happens again for ""possession of illegal substances."" It was sodium nitrite. You know, the stuff used for curing meat? The stuff that's completely fucking legal? That I bought from Amazon for gods sake? When I told the school I didn't have anything illegal they didn't believe me. I'm pissed at the cops for not including that vital fucking piece of info in their report. Now when I order more I'm going to have to be extremely protective of it in case it gets reported again and they once again neglect to mention that it's a LEGAL SUBSTANCE that literally anyone can buy/have. 

I don't even know why I'm typing all of this. I guess just to get it out there. I need the prolonged care of a hospital visit. My boss would probably fire me. She would be livid if I just texted her saying I was taking a week off with no warning. I need my job. I can't lose it. As much as I hate working at least it's something to keep me sane. Without a job my days would just be spent sitting in my room and staring at the wall praying for a freak fucking aneurism to kill me. I feel like I don't deserve the hospital. I'm not going to kill myself right now. I don't have the stuff anymore, they took it away. I have to get more before I'm even in any danger so maybe I'm just looking for attention. I don't actually need help I just want to feel cared for. I just want a break. I wish I could be better. I wish I could go to the hospital and just have them help me. I need help. I need help so badly but I'm too scared to ask. I should have told the police to take me to the hospital but I was too scared. I don't have a car. I can't get there by myself. I'm so scared. I just want the world to stop moving so I can catch my breath.",1
"I don't feel goodSo I am 17 and have been appearing for a lot of entrance tests for various colleges right now. In my country, India one exam particularly \(JEE\) the 2nd most ""prestigious"" exams to get into some national level colleges and also to qualify for writing the most prestigious exam of our country \(IIT\). 

&amp;nbsp;

So I \(and almost 1 million other people\) have been preparing for this exam from the past 2 years. In my first year, after 3 months I was put in a ""toppers only class"" kind of thing. That is when it all went downhill, I couldn't cope up, I lost interest and pretty much flunked my first year. I was shifted to the normal class for the 2nd year and I again started performing good. There were ups and downs but it was satisfactory to say the least.

&amp;nbsp;

Then it was around Jan'2018 when the classes stopped so everyone was doing self\-study for the next 3\-4 months. It was during these months that I tried to learn my first year matter because this exam \(jEE\) has the course spreading over grade 11 and 12. So I tried, but I started loosing interest and just got distracted every time i sat down to study. My mum, goes to work so I was o=pretty much alone at home for near about 12 hours and could not study anything even when I tried to. It got to the point that I invited my grandparents so there would be someone at home to monitor me but I just couldn't study.

&amp;nbsp;

My mum was pretty supporting and used to tell me not to get tensed and that if everything goes bad she would get me a seat in her companies University \(The company she works for is in the education industry\). I somehow studied for the last month and was feeling okayish about this exam. 

&amp;nbsp;

Then the exam came and it wasn't good, but I expected I would qualify for the main exam and kind of knew I wouldn't be getting a good college that were given based on the scores of this exam. My mum, checked my paper that night, despite both of us agreeing that we would wait for the results. I then gave an examination for a private university 4 days later which is kinda easier than the other paper. 10 days after that I gave 2 more entrance exams which were okayish but I was never gonna go to those 2.

&amp;nbsp;

The results came for the first private exam and I did bad \(got 20k rank out of 200,000\) then  the \(JEE\) results came and I absolutely shit the bed. I couldn't even qualify for the main exam \(74 was the cut\-off and I got 70\) . My three other friends \(we foour studied together in my 2nd year and were very good students, not the best but still very good\) had bad performances as well but 1 qualified due to reserved seats and other qualified by 2 marks \(76\).

&amp;nbsp;

I still have 2 major exams left but I am just not finding in me the guy who used to study religiously. I resort to staring at the wall for hours rather than studying from the book kept in front of me. I have lost all hope and am unable to do anything. My mum, is pissed at me all the time and i get scoldings everyday. No\-one understands how hard it is for me to study and I seriously try to do it. My dad \( lives in other state, due to job\) doesn't help my case either. He just blames me for not studying and I can't say anything. I am like that happy, friendly and comic\-relief guy in your friends group who is always happy but nowadays i am just sad all the time and don't feel like living.

&amp;nbsp;

P.S. Sorry, for the long post but I needed to get it out. Any help/motivation to study \(I have 25 days before my last major exam and have the ability to do good\) would be appreciated.",1

"i’m ruining my family’s livesi’ve only made this account to say this. i hope it justifies my next actions, and hope even more that people agree with me. 

i’ve been horrible to my family my entire life. my relationship with my father was always horrible, but he puts more of an effort into being a part of my life than ever before. i’m selfish and ungrateful. 

i’m 17 years old, and my mom loves me and my brothers more than the world. she deserves better than ill ever be. i just got into another screaming match with her today (and it’s not even noon yet) because everything keeps getting blown out of proportion. i can’t ever leave things alone or just listen. 

i used to have really horrible behavioral issues. i would yell and scream and break things and my brother would cry and hide from me. i was only 12 or so. even now he cries when my mom and i fight. 

my mom doesn’t give the same amount of attention to them as she has to me, and it’s my fault. i’m always jealous, always afraid, always wanting her love. it’s disgusting of me, and my 6 year old brother doesn’t know a life outside of the constant arguing. 

i tried to hang myself in eighth grade. my mom found me and i don’t think a day goes by where she doesn’t think of it.

i’m a genuinely bad person. 
i love my family and i want better for them. i’ll never be better. i cry all the time, i’m lonely, and i push people away.

"Feeling overwhelming shameWell.. i originally made this reddit profile for this sub, but came out of the hard feelings that overwhelmed me at the time. I was a heavy drug user and hallucinations caused suicidal tendencies at the time. Ive been clean for almost 3 months now, but, things are feeling awful again. 

A little back story to why i feel as i do. A couple years ago i got divorced and since then i haven't been in my daughters life, my fault. I abandoned them. It haunts me. I tried to see my daughter back in March of this year. I went to my ex wifes house and long story short cops were called and i was arrested. Im facing 20 years in prison due to that arrest. My trial is in january. I lost my career due to my arrest and i have been out of work since march. Luckily my mother has let me stay with her. Ive lost seemingly everything that used to be my life and everyday that passes i miss my daughter more and more. I feel im going to end up in prison for a long time. Life on standby for 20 years. My kid.. older than i am now when i get released. 

I dream of my little girl, and my ex wife, a lot. Its a constant burden that's hanging over me... thinking of them, even tho they have both long forgot me. My ex wife has a restraining order on me since my arrest and its the most pain ive been in. Feeling like a piece of trash. I dont want to live a life in prison. I dont want to live a life without my little girl. I want to go back to the drugs. Right now i drown myself in alcohol and smoke weed just to feel anything other than sadness and hopelessness. Ive talked to a therapist in the past about all of this and they throw ""youre going thru a lot right now all at once, its going to be overwhelming.""

In my mind.. i know that the life i used to have will never return to me. Thats what haunts me. I just wanna hold my little girl and hear her laugh. Tuck her in at night. But i wont get that. 

I think im going to write my ex wife a letter soon, eventhough im legally restricted. But it'll give me some closure, just to let her know.

Im having to drive across country in two weeks and in my mind that would be the best time to disappear. Im scared tbh. Im ashamed i messed up my life and left my girl without her dad. Im glad this platform exists so i can get this out of my head. ",1

We're living at my parents, both of us unemployed and without a chance to get employed (no respectable experience, no career path, and this damn virus).

"My boyfriend knows about the thoughts I’ve been having, and wants to send me to a mental health facility. I don’t know what to do, so I’m just here I guess.I was at work, going over the options I had to make an attempt. Wanted it to be a guaranteed thing but also painless. Didn’t want to OD, too painful and hellish based on the accounts I’ve read here. No access to a gun. Didn’t want to speed down a road and wreck my car, might end up in the hospital, which is the exact opposite of what I want to happen. I’d tentatively decided on hanging; I’d tried it before but freaked out and stopped.

I was debating on writing a note out, an explanation as to why I did it, what I wanted my family to do with my bank accounts and social media accounts, arraignments for what would remain of me, etc.

But I’ve always had so much trouble writing down what I want. I can’t seem to articulate my emotions, my reasons behind my actions..I don’t think I could ever write it down in a way where it would be comforting to anyone who reads it.

Before I’d left for work, I’d given my boyfriend a quick summary on how bad I was feeling (he’d only known about how I hadn’t talked to basically anyone since Friday unless I was approached; or how I didn’t go farther than my bathroom until he’d called me at 11 at night and invited me to his place; how I’d hadn’t eaten much of anything from Friday night to Tuesday that I’d felt low energy and weak) but he didn’t know my thoughts, my urges.

He had me look him in the eye and said gingerly, “when I got off work, we’re going to have a serious talk about this.” My mental health is always sporadic, but there have been times where it had gotten so low that I’d have to stay with him for days at a time so he could keep an eye on me and make sure I was safe and eating at least once every couple of hours.

I got off and went home. I showered and then I went outside, sat in my front steps, and listened to music from life is strange: before the storm, and looked at the cloudy sky.

He pulled up in my driveway and sat down with me and we talked out in the 50 degree night. I was murmuring my words, almost straining to hear myself at times. I talked about how I’d always kept suicide as an option in the back of my mind and how sometimes the option would be forgotten and how during these times I had high hopes for me to graduate college and start a career and get an apartment and live with the love of my life; and how, when i got bad and the option became more of the only choice I saw, I realized that I was almost convincing myself that I could actually build a life despite believing that I will never amount to anything and how I’m inferior to everyone my age and how I have no sort of qualities anyone would find redeeming.

I talked about how I felt guilty for feeling this way because everyone I’ve told either would be absolutely heartbroken or terrified about me. How, if I told my parents, they’d break down and ask why I didn’t want to go to them and that I could just talk to them any time; how I felt like I couldn’t because, well, we don’t want to bother anyone when we’re like this.

I talked about how it’d be easier if I was completely alone.

He squeezed me tightly. I heard his voice break as he said “I know this is selfish of me to ask..but please, don’t do it. For me..”

My voice didn’t waver as I said “I’ve been doing that for 8 years now.”

He asked if I felt I needed to go to the mental health facility In the capital. I’ve never been to that one, but I’ve heard that it’s a bad experience, like most mental health facility experiences are I suppose.

“I don’t want to. But I guess I have to.” I wanted to die, I wanted to stop existing because I don’t see any sort of reason for me to try building this pathetic thing someone would call a “life”. But..at the same time, I’m scared. I guess it’s human instinct to be scared of what we don’t know, scared of death because we don’t know what will happen to our consciousness.

I wanted to die, but at the same time, I guess I was hesitant because maybe some sliver of hope existed within me that **maybe, just maybe** I could actually amount to something and build some semblance of a life.

He kissed me on the forehead. “How about you come over to my apartment and spend the night? I can keep an eye on you, and we can call that facility in the morning. But we’re gonna have to talk to your father about this.”

That was all last night. It’s now 1 in the afternoon. He’s been hesitant about making the call, debating on whether or not we should talk with my parents first. I don’t know what to do about it. I’m just here, in his apartment, waiting for something to happen.

I don’t like the idea of a psychiatric ward. I feel like it’s not going to help—I’m already in weekly dbt group, bi weekly individual therapy, and on medication. I’m convinced nothing is going to help and that I’ll be like this for the rest of my days, whether those days are limited or just a long stretch of time. I’ve been to 5 psychiatrists; 6 different medications, some for years at a time before I realized it wasn’t helping at all; 7 therapists. Nothing has helped me in the long run. Nothing has helped me “get better” in any capacity.

At this point..I think I’m just trying for other people. Maybe I’m just putting off the inevitable, shoving it aside for the next couple months or year or years.

I know that committing yourself takes a certain strength; but I feel like I would have been stronger if I had committed suicide.",1

So much would have to change in order for me to feel that life was tolerable. I want to jump out of my skin. No one is ever going to want to be with me, because I am profoundly unattractive, and I have no other appealing qualities. No one has ever expressed attraction to me, and no one ever will. As sad as that makes me, the thought of actually physically being with another person makes me want to vomit. No one wants to touch me, and I don't want to touch anyone, so there's nothing to be done. I will be this way for the rest of my short pathetic life.

EDIT: I probably should have included what happened this year in my life

Well my mother had a second stroke almost exactly one year after her first. This one has almost physically disabled her and left her in a perpetual state of anxiety. Then I started messing up at my crap job. Got written up three times. Then I made the mistake in enrolling in classes an hours drive away thinking I could get a promotion later on. After that my father, the only person caring for my mother, died suddenly. Both myself and my sister had to quit our jobs and move back in with her. Our hometown sucks by the way. The last of our pets died soon after. Now I've lost almost all of my money when just in June I was so close to saving up to my next financial goalmark. I have no friends and no girlfriend so I'm pretty much all alone outside my immediate family.",1
"I feel like I am hopelessI don't know what to do anymore. I came here for advice, since I can't really talk with anyone else and since nobody knows who I am. I am very sad. 

I never had a lot of friends, but that was fine for me, since I don't like the idea of having many friends. My actual friends are very nice, they are helping me and they are listening to me when I need to talk to someone. Of course, I also had a few friends who hurt me so much and they still don't know, but it's fine since I chose to get away from them. I came here to just vent off my feelings and maybe someone has another advice other than ""just hang in there"". 

For me, highschool was painful. I was not bullied, but I wasn't very close with people. Only later. My parents are very strict, my dad has and is still verbally abusing me(when i see it's getting physical, i just shut up). I talked with my friends, but I can't tell everything. It was a period when everyday me and him would just shout at each other and say horrible things. That period was also the time when I had a fight with my group of friends because they didn't really respect me. It was also the time where I was'n very sure about my sexuality. It was very hard for me, I cried every night, but I managed to get myself put of that situation and meet new people, put myself in new situations. My escape was always gameplays. Highschool wasn't hard at all for me, I spent all the time watching youtube and I still got As. I was very anxious in that classroom, I felt like ppl with whom I didn't speak before hated me(which is probably true since we were divided in groups). In those horrible years I grew so much and changed my view of point a lot. I never experienced a relationship, I panicked when feelings were mutual. And the guys that I really liked and I was prepare to confess my feelings, they made me suffer and I was crying because of them, so I stopped believing in everything that has to do with romance. I thought that it was gonna be over, that ""this is the hard period in my life"". But I was wrong

Slowly, i got sicker and sicker. My period sucks a lot,I can't do anything for 2 days. It sounds stupid but it affects me a lot. I also am sick and I did so many bloodtests and ecographs and stuff like that, but nothing came wrong. It is exhausting to wake up every day, feel sick for 4 hours, then when it's night to feel the same thing. I don't know why, I tried to do sports(which was very painful for me). A lot of my time is wasted on this sickness, and it s affecting my life so much. Also, i have breathing problems, so I am trying very much to breath every day. I had a panick attack in the past, and now they are coming back. Now in college, it's hard. I am behind my work so much because I was sick for 7 weeks. I didn't pay atention to any seminar, I didn't go to courses. Now I have to work hard, since exams are close. I am doing college from home since the pandemic, but a lot of my friends left the town and I literally have no one here. Every one is busy(that is in my town), since it's not highschool anymore. I reached the point where i am waiting for my parents to finish eating so i can go eat alone. I crave for the moments when i am alone in the house. 

And since i have a lot of medical problems, and car sickness, when I am going into a different town or i just wanna hang out with friends and eat, i get very sick and i can't focus on anything else. I have social anxiety, which not all of my friends get. It's hard for me to make myself get out of the house and talk to ppl. My dream is to travel, but I don't think I am capable. When I went to a different city for 3 days, I was soo sick from train travelling that it was just a nightmare. I recently have began driving school, but that is a pain too. 

You see, I didn't really have a happy adolescene, since my parents are strict. I am 18 years old and in the winter my maximum hour for outside is 6:00 pm. It sucks. Think how much it affected me in highschool. I am very sick, i reached the point where I can't get out of my bed without feeling like throwing up. I am locked in this house with no one to talk f2f. I am overwhelemed by college. I am tired of faking it. I don't want to end it, because I am also thinking that it's gonna be better. But it's not. It's getting harder and harder for me. The little things exhaust me so much :( . I don't have any time for my passions. I am just staying in bed trying to feel better. I don't know what to do, I don't want to do nothing because i ll waste time. I am afraid that it will get even harder, and i don't think i can face that. I am hopeless and filled with hope for future at the same time.",1

"How do you think your death would affect the world?I didn't mean to sound so menacing. I genuinely want to know what do you think would change after you died. I think the ""world"" seems a bit farfetched so it's okay if you can answer in a smaller scale.

As for my answer to my own question, it probably would be a lot quieter in our home since I was always the one screaming and laughing my ass off for something silly.. My brother would probably hate me for leaving all the dishes to him. My parents would miss lecturing me for every mistake I made. My friends online from a game will probably wonder what the heck happened to me that I just quit the game so suddenly. My new puppy would be more loved by my parents since he would only remind them of me. My student loans will probably be wiped off the earth too. ",1

"Don't know if this is the right place need helpOkay so i will probably just be told to break up with her and I'll feel better, but i won't. I have a girlfriend. She's normally sweet, loving, and caring. But sometimes... She gets terrible.

It only ever happens at night while we're texting. She gets mad and... She tells me that im worthless. She tells me im stupid. She tells me some lies and some truths to get mte down. The day afterwords, she always realizes how terrible she was being. It's like she's in a different state of mind. She says its because she desperately needs my attention and i always pay more attention to her after this happens. She is was recently  like this. It's worse this time. 

I finally told her we needed to talk to so someone about this because (here comes the relevance) it makes me suicidly depressed everytime she does it. She said no. She said to act like nothing happened. She asked me if i was sad and i lied and said no. She knew i was lying. But if i said yes, she would of gone off on me. I feel like a rape victim.

I don't know what to do. If theres a better subreddit for this question, please direct me there, but this needs to come to a stop. I started tying the noose this time. I will be told to just break up with her but that will only have the same effect. ",1

"I wish when I tried killing myself when I was 17 I had succeeded. The last 7ish years have been a complete waste of timeIf I erased the last seven years of my life from having ever happened. I'd be better for it. I went to college and graduated or whatever, but I didn't really enjoy college. I currently can't find work, I'm broke as fuck working at a department store in my redneck hometown that I hate. All my friends have moved away, I wouldn't even know where to start meeting women if I wanted to but the average woman in my age range where I'm at isn't even worth the effort to talk to, and my life just ends up being a series of disappointments. Even when I learn to set my bar lower and lower, I still come up short. At this point it's almost asking too much to just be left alone. 

&amp;#x200B;

As I sit here, witnessing a lot of my friends who were a year or so younger than me getting out of college, and by extension moving away (I went to college only about an hour away from home, dormed though), I just realize that my life is probably never going to get better. I don't have a well connected family, I don't live in a fruitful town as far as employment is concerned, I don't have a lucrative major, I don't have any useful talents or skills, and all my friends live hours away from me, most of whom are doing way better things with their lives than I am. I really just wish that I hadn't made it when I tried killing myself at 17. I stopped bleeding probably like 5 minutes before I would've passed out, and had I just stopped this charade sooner rather than later, I would've saved myself a lot of continuous aggravation and disappointment.

i’ve had three attempts at ending my life but obviously they didn’t work.. i ended up being hospitalised for one of them and i really hope i don’t fuck up with this one and fail because there’s absolutely no way i’m going back to a hospital.

i’ve been thinking about it for quite some time on when i’m going to do it, and last week i got some rope and new blades and decided i’m doing it on the 31st. in the early hours of the morning i’m going to get up and drive to the tallest bridge in my state and hang myself. it’s been closed for years, but people still go check it out even though it’s illegal. 

i have everything planned out. i have my notes written out to my family and roommate and i have special instructions for one of my family members on what to do with my belongings. 

i don’t know if this is weird to say, but i’m kind of excited for saturday. i finally get relief after all these years. no more pain. no more sadness. no more terrible withdrawals from drug use. it’ll be all gone. i feel a sense of calmness for once in my life.

I'm waiting for university reassessment results atm. The results come out in about 21 days.

If I fail this reassessment, I'll have to repeat the year. I fear that the unit teacher hates me because I argued against their decision in the first exam.

I failed the first exam due to some minor technical difficulties. If it weren't for that difficulty, I would have gotten 90%+ in that exam. The technical difficulty is easy to circumvent, but despite that I still failed.

I argued and argued against that decision. I revised my ass for that first exam. And yet I still failed.

Now because of this minor technical issue, I have to deal with the stress of results day again, I have to continue paying rent despite not knowing my academic condition, I have to prepare for university and simultaneously prepare not to go. I'm stuck in a limbo.

"Maybe I'm just looking for excuses, but I want to tell my story before I take my life. Hello. My name is Alena. I’m looking for a miracle I suppose. Any reason to not take my own life.  
 

I’ve worked so hard to get where I’m at. Granted, in so many ways, where I am isn’t great. But I’m one of those people that it’s unbelievable that I’m still alive. It feels like such an achievement to not be dead yet. I’ll try to explain, but, I’m not even sure where to start.  
 

I’m a passing trans-woman; I live with my girlfriend of 12 years in a deep-south U.S. city. I’ve worked so hard to get here. I didn’t begin transition until the age of 30, four years ago, and I never thought I’d survive the process. I told myself I’d try, and if/when I failed, I’d just kill myself. I was naïve enough at that time to think that all my problems would go away if I could just achieve that goal. Of course, that’s absurd. But I needed to cling to something, anything; I’ve struggled with suicidal ideation my entire life.  
 

I’ve been in some form of counseling or recovery since the age of 21. I’ve had one of those tragic lives whose shadow I’ve tried all my days to escape from. It’s the kind of story that happens in memoirs, novels and movies. It’s usually a powerful experience when I’ve had the chance to share it. And I’ve been lucky to have been able to talk about it before quite a few crowds of people; once in an auditorium of 600 people. To share that story, to move so many people to tears… honestly, it was one of my most proud days. My story meant something. I’ve often been told how inspirational my life is, how my life is going to turn into some crazy success story.  
 

I’ve wanted to believe that. So much. Some days, it felt so possible. But I also feel that deep down, I knew better. That I was just too broken. I wanted to prove myself wrong. But here I am, possibly writing my last words.  
 

I was one of two unwanted children. My brother, born a year before me, came two months early. My mother and father were both addicts, and they both used throughout her pregnancies. My brother was born with six fingers on each hand, but was otherwise okay.  
 

I came a year later, one month early. Both my brother and I were severely underweight, able to fit into an open palm. I had no major deformities, but I was incredibly sickly. I’d have pneumonia four times in my first year, and three more times by the age of ten. I was stricken with shingles at the incredible age of 11, and I’d nearly die of mononucleosis at 15. This is all very relevant to my current situation.   
 

I was a beautiful child. I was 20% underweight until I hit puberty. I had long, thick blonde hair, deep emerald green eyes, high cheekbones and a slight build. Most people mistook me for a girl at a glance. I didn’t say a word until I was closing in on my third birthday. Doctors told my parents that I’d be developmentally delayed. I worked with a speech therapist until the age of 5, but I preferred to remain quiet.   
 

My parents were not good people. But one of the more benevolent things they did when I was very young was buy me and my brother a $4,000 encyclopedia set. I couldn’t tell you why. But I did love them, and I taught myself to read at a very early age thanks to the full-color pictures it had on every entry. The knowledge I consumed would go on to be very handy in my academic life.  
 

I lived a very solitary existence up until kindergarten. We lived in a deep rural area, and there was only a handful of nearby children. All of which were girls. My father would beat me into unconsciousness regularly because of how effeminate I was, and he forbade me to have female friends. He’d regularly go off about how I was a faggot, a queer, a homo; all words that I had no idea what they meant at the time. He said that having only girlfriends was making me into a homosexual.  
 

My father was a monster. He suffered from both schizophrenia and dissociative-identity-disorder. More than that, he was downright terrifying. One of his more disturbing qualities was how non-expressive he was. His face was like some horrible mask. He always had a serene-looking, slightly amused expression across his face. It didn’t matter if he was reading his bible (his only hobby) or beating you until your blood spattered the ceiling, he always had that same terrible non-emotion on his face.  
 

He was completely chaotic, seemingly without any rhyme-or-reason. He was triggered by anything and everything it seemed. Our home was so quiet, for any noise could set him off. So much as a giggle in your room could unleash his fury. He’d stand up from his reading chair, grab his metal-studded leather belt that he kept for such occasions, and with that terrible serene expression he’d whip you until he felt like you’d learned your lesson. Whether he was hitting me or my brother or mother, I learned to get through those moments by counting how many times the belt cracked like a whip across flesh. No lesson was less than ten lashes. Most were around 30. Sometimes more. Sometimes, you were even lucky enough to lose consciousness eventually. Sometimes.  
 

God this is going to be long. I don’t know why, but I feel like I need to tell my story. It’s funny, I’ve been told to write my story at least a hundred times, that it’d easily get published. And maybe that’s even true. Now, I don’t even know if anyone is really going to give a shit.  
 

I think I need a break. And that’s good, I think. As long as I want to tell my story, then that keeps me alive a little longer. Once I finish though… who knows? Maybe I’ll feel better. Maybe no one will give a fuck, and that will be that. But it’s something to cling to. I’m out of other options.   
 

If you’ve made it this far, and want to hear more, good. And thank you. I need you now, dear reader. I don’t want to die. Please help me find something to grasp onto. I’m just tired of pretty lies. I need something real.   
 

I’ll be here. Writing more. I think I’ll try to go vote, though. It’s something. Then I’ll come back, when I can, with more of the story. I promise it will be one you’ll never forget.  


If there's a better place for my post, please let me know. I feel rather ignorant about Reddit in general. Thanks.  
 

Love,

"Life isn't worth living*This is a very personal post so if you don't care about listening to the whining of a kid, do yourself a favor and move on.*

This is just an unloading of some thoughts I've just been having recently. I can't talk to anyone about them. Maybe because I'm worried that they'll be too worried or because I'm worried that they'll agree, and at that point there's only one option left. I just need to get this out there, to say it as it comes to me.

Every time I wake up, I wonder why? Why should I get out of bed? If you knew me, you'd tell me that I need to because I have to go to college. But why do I want to? I feel like an outcast there, even though I'm most people's friend. I'm not smart enough to be there, there's so many people better than me at every one of my subjects. I feel embarrassed to even be in the same room as most of them, because they have to be thinking 'why is he here? He's nowhere as good as he thinks he is'. Most of the work I do feels pointless anyway. I mean let's face it, it's probably not gonna lead me anywhere. But more on that in a sec...
I suppose you could say hanging out with my friends is worth it but I spend maybe just over an hour a day with them at best, and even though we have fun I still feel empty. Probably because any sort of meaningful conversation is off limits and we only talk about humorous banalities. It's fun in the moment, but only in the moment. I'm not staying here just for that moment. Not to mention the fact that I'm none of their best friends. To me, that matters.

But ok, let's talk about after I complete my A-Levels. Best case scenario, I get what I need. What next? Well, more of the same really, just in a different setting. University. Now we're looking at even more work and even more loneliness. Likelihood is, if I don't make good friends quickly, I'll be going to lectures and going back to my dorm all day, every day. That sounds like no way to live. Plus, looking at the current state of things, getting a job is looking unlikely and if I get one, it's going to be horrible. I mean, say I do get a job. Then we're looking at the majority of my days being taken up by mind numbing and tedious tasks being completed day in, day out so that I can receive a fraction of the money I generate while my boss keeps threatening to fire me. Great. And even if I do stick with it long enough to rise up the ladder, I'm going to turn around in my middle age and realize it was all for nothing but a bit of money and a shiny car and I'm still as alone and depressed as I've always been. Even better. But that might not happen because I don't want any sort of corporate job. I want to be a writer... a group of people so depressed, alcoholic and suicidal that it's become a cliche. Chances are my ideas are way too derivative for my work to ever be anything but criticized and mocked, if ever noticed at all. So in terms of a career, the odds of my life being fulfilling are against me.

But what about love? Doesn't that make it worth it? Love has tried its best to steer clear of me. Every time I've fallen in love, without fail and no mater how reciprocal it's seemed, they rejected me. Probably with good reason. I'm not the most unattractive guy, but I can't be good to be around as I'm sure you can tell from this post. I get nervous, insecure and clingy. Great boyfriend material. Anyway, even if I could fall in love with a girl who loved me back, what next? We just carry on the relationship until one of us falls out of love or dies. Painful no matter what. I'll probably end up as one of those divorced forty year old's who still desperately tries to get into the dating scene but cries in his car outside clubs and eventually hangs himself in his studio apartment, leaving his remaining few grand to the kids who pity him anyway. But likelihood is, none of this will happen. Love is rare, probably too rare for an ordinary kid like me, and I'm likely to go my entire life without ever again feeling it. 

A greater good? Yeah right. Have you seen our current political landscape? Have you seen anything we've ever created? Our species' very touch is insidious. We're fucked, and our best chance of being saved is long gone. Human beings are animals, violent and selfish. As long as we hold onto those base urges, we'll never have an equal and functioning society. All we are are biological puppets with heads full of false imaginings. We were fucked from the get go. 

So you must be thinking 'Christ, you're clearly depressed. Go get help.' What help? Everyone I know who's on antidepressants is still fucked in some way or another. And it feels odd to turn to altering my chemical makeup and blocking out thoughts as the only way to be happy. It feels like I'm right, but I'm going to willfully ignore it. Or a shrink. Barely better than a priest. Someone to give me an illusion of hope, to tell me there's a light at the end of the tunnel offering nothing but sentiment and a professional smile. Then taking my money for it.

Right. That's all that comes to mind right now. I know, it's very bleak, but isn't that what this sub's for? Anyway, thanks to anyone who reads and responds.

Tldr: A career won't satisfy me, love keeps evading me, the human race is hopeless and I can't see a way out.",1

"Nothing good, nothing badEvery month or so I get the urge to do it, and every month or so I don't, today's that time of the month again and I decided to give this a shot to see if I can get out of it.

Short story is, I don't have any place in society. I have no hobbies, no particular objectives, no redeeming qualitys, no nothing. I just kind of sit around existing being a drag to my mom and not looking forward to anything.

17 y/o with 18 coming up faster than I'd like, finishing high school hating the fact that life is coming up to me soon-ish and I still might as well be 12 years old mentally. Last ""real"" friend I had was when I was maybe 13, and even then it was pushing it since looking back he was just searching desperately for excuses to cut me off, then last friends were at around 15 after we moved from our country but it turned out some girl in the group just had a thing for me and semi-forced me in her group to get close, obviously once she got to know me and my shit personality she backed off and the group of friends was freed for me. Honestly I don't know where I'm going with this I don't know what kind of information I'm supposed to give to you guys, so I guess I'll try to answer any questions that come up, I have no idea what you can say to me but I guess I wanted a place to get this off my chest.",1

"I feel so trappedThis is a throwaway acct cause my irl friends know my main one :/

Idk what happened, I was doing so well. I’m on my senior year of high school, have good grades, got a great scholarship to my dream school, have amazing friends, and a wonderful boyfriend who I’ve been with for almost 9 months. 

And i don’t understand. I fucked it all up. My depression hit me harder than it ever has before about a week ago and i just feel so numb. I don’t care about anyone or anything. I used to be such a kind and polite person, but I’m lashing out at everyone. My boyfriend is taking the worst of it. It’s like an out of body experience, like someone else has control. I watch myself from a third person perspective as I berate him and argue with him over the tiniest of issues. I feel like I don’t love him anymore, but that’s because I don’t love anything anymore.

I wanna stay with him, but I wanna leave at the same time because I feel like all I’m doing is hurting him. I’ve been pushing all my friends away by flat out ghosting them and I just want everyone to let me die in peace. Why can’t they see this is what I want?

I just wanna fall asleep gently and never wake up, and I have no one even think about me ever again. What’s wrong with me??? I have so much to be grateful for but I hate it all and I can’t stop thinking of destroying my own life, then killing myself.",1

"I'm an empty husk! Nice to meet you!My first suicide attempt really scared my mom and traumatized my little sister. I don't want to hurt them even worse, but there hasn't been a day for years where I haven't wanted to end it. It's because of them that I'm still here, but sometimes I wish I didn't have those attachments so I could end things easily without having to worry about hurting others. I don't want to hurt anyone else, I just want to stop being alive.

I guess it doesn't make that much sense I guess because my life is pretty good objectively, I have people that love me and I'm really grateful for them, but a built up past of constant childhood abuse and years of depression have made me into a husk anyway. I don't really have any ambitions or interests. I don't bother trying to talk to others besides the family members I live with and I don't really have any desire to even leave the house. I don't see myself *going* anywhere in the future. For years, the only future I've seen for myself is an eventual suicide and I still believe that's true. I'm going to college now and I'm pulling through alright (due to a light course load), but even this feels pointless and useless if I'm going to die soon anyway.

I have a chronic illness that causes me a lot of physical pain and I have mental problems too (as you can probably tell). Because I have a variety of issues like this, I feel like I should never have been born anyway. I think me coming into the world was probably a mistake somehow because if my body and mind are this messed up, then it seems clear that I would have been better off as a miscarriage or whatever. 

Sorry for the stupid post. On the bright side though, I made it to 21 years of age without dying, which was unthinkable years ago, so who knows how long I'll be able to hold out. Thanks for reading I guess",1

"If the girl my best friend is going to ask out says yes, then there's no reason to live anymoreLiterally the only person I have in this entire world is my best friend, and on Friday he's going to ask one of his coworkers out on a date. If she says yes, then we won't be able to hang out anymore. I'm a lesbian, but he comes over two or three times a week and sleeps over because he lives out of town and it's a bit of a commute to get to school and work. We're really close. I consider him my brother and I know he thinks of me the same way, but both of us know how girls are. If he starts dating this girl, she's not going to allow him to see me or even talk to me much. 

I haven't told him any of this, but I've been depressed and suicidal for my entire life. It's gotten to be so normal for me that I'm an expert at hiding it. I was adopted by a family who later abandoned me and now wants nothing to do with me. I got into contact with my biological family last year, but they are messed up beyond repair, and quite honestly, I hate them. Just last night my alcoholic birth mother called me up and informed me how she ""relapsed"" (for the seventh time that week), broke her wrist somehow (she think she may have punched something) and then fell asleep with a lit cigarette and later woke up on fire. She spent two months in the burn unit and was then allowed to return to her apartment. My biological sister is a convicted felon, my older brother is chronically homeless... and my younger biological brother lives with my adoptive family and doesn't want to speak to me.

As for me, my life is turned around, but there is no joy in it because I have nobody to share it with. I am in college, earn decent grades, live on my own, have a job... but it's empty.

The only reason I haven't killed myself is because of my friend, but once he's gone, there's no reason not to do it. I might end up having a superficially great future, but deep down, there will be nothing to it. I don't have medical insurance so I can't get on antidepressants or get much-needed treatment for my thyroid disease. I can go days without eating, yet still somehow manage to gain weight. All I ever want to do is sleep. 

Anyway, if she says yes, after he moves all his things out of my place and returns his key (yes, we're that close), I'm going to do it. I'm so tired, and life hurts so much.",1

"What can I do? I feel like I have no other option.Since I've been in college, I partied and slacked off my freshman year only to try to raise my gpa again while taking my hard chemistry courses my sophomore year. My gpa was still shy of the 2.00 mark where I need it to be to receive my scholarships again. I'm already $45000 in debt from private loans. My course of action was to take a summer course to receive an A and raise my gpa again. Yesterday was the due date for the first discussion and I finished typing it 15 minutes late (it was open for 8 hours and I had to work most of the day) my professor said no excuses and gave me a 0. At this point, it is impossible for me to get another A and I can't take out anymore loans. I play football and my coaches are constantly disappointed in me and make sure I know it. I have tried talking to the professor to make an exception and he wont. My academic advisor says it is too late to register for another course.

"Suicide because I’m lazyI’m not sure if I actually have depression or not but it certainly feels like it. I just feel perpetually stressed out about everything in my life no matter how small or large the issue is. I feel like I have this heavy blanket on sometimes and I just can’t really seem to get it off of me. 

I am lazy, I don’t like doing things I don’t want to do. I procrastinate a shit ton. I absolutely hate the thought of going to work for 40 hours a week for the rest of my life. I cannot stand that thought and it just makes me so sad. 

I’ve been thinking a lot lately about how I can get around this working for the rest of my life thing and I can’t think of anything. Obviously everyone else does it and that makes me feel weak and then I feel worse about myself. 

I’ve been having a lot of thoughts about killing myself because that’s really the only option I see. I don’t want to work, but I don’t want to be seen as a deadbeat or a piece of shit of society. I don’t want handouts and I certainly don’t want people feeling sorry for me. 

I’m currently living with my parents who are upper middle class and white and my life thus far has been, for all intents and purposes, perfect. I’ve never gone without. 

I just honestly don’t see how I can go through this life, but I know that killing my self will tear my parents up.

"A titleI am finished. I thought I had finally made a stable sane life. Got fired from my career of 5 years a few months ago because apparently Asset Protection is more about protecting the asses of your supervisors than the assets of the company.

Couldn't pay to get it out. Spent my rent money on that. Finally getting interview calls, in the process of being evicted. This week has been ok. Last week, I slept twice. Had people banging on my doors and windows all times if day, had enough I could feel it in the walls. I'm done.

"Soon to be homelessNot doing well - like 6 months ago my partner and I (and our 3 cats) moved from a small town like 30 minutes away to the metro in with my ""friend"" A.C. , we were there 9 days and then she kicked us out because of reasons like I ""dressed like a slut"" and I rearranged some cleaning chemicals so I could fit my things, among some other asinine reasons. 
I'm pretty sure she just wanted to take our money and kick us out from the get go or she's just that crazy.

So we moved in with my kind of friends G Rockwell and P Estes - not to stigmatize mental illness but we all have Borderline Personality Disorder and P was a diagnosed Narcissist and sociopath. P Estes was disgusting and would constantly leave piss and shit on the toilet seat, they never cleaned up after themselves (but I never said a word, we were just there temporarily and I didn't want to get kicked out) 
We had another roommate with an outside cat and it gave my cats tapeworms, I freak out about having to clean all by myself - everything had to be cleaned including the pantry bc the cat slept in there alot and on the countertops and such. P Estes kicked us out after giving them rent the day before (even though when we originally were promised we wouldn't need to pay rent).
It was dramatic, and awful, we were ""disrespectful"" for suggesting they were unclean. 

We were there for a month and a half and moved from the metro to live with his parents temporarily out in the country.

It was a nightmare they are Fox News brainwashed Trump supporting Christians. His mom's a piece of work - hates other women, slutshames, and fatshames, Is homophobic and transphobic. Which all made me extremely uncomfortable.

She would always need to do laundry all of a sudden when I was doing a load or needing to use the kitchen when I wanted to cook. It wouldn't matter the time of day so I started staying up till 7 am when they got up and sleeping until 4 or 5 pm  if possible. It reminded me of living with my own mother and I hated it.

We were there for 2 months  ish 

Then we moved into a trailor next door on August 11th - by the 21st our landlords were trying to evict us because - Backstory: we made an anonymous report when we first moved in with his parents to the Environmental Protection Agency about the landlords dumping illegally into a natural creek on the property, stuff like roofing tiles and just general trash.

The 21st of August is when someone came out to serve them papers and even though the report was anonymous they immediately blamed us and have been harassing us - an actual nightmare.
Threatening us and saying they'll burn the trailor down and sending neighbors to tell us to get the fuck out and that we are unwelcome.
We'd move but we don't have the money and I don't have any friends or family willing to take us in - I've reached out to everyone I can think of everyday for a month. 

I keep hoping things will get better and then they just don't - I had to rehome 2 of my cats when we moved from the metro in with his parents - and I may have to rehome my last one. Which I never wanted to do - I love my cats like my children. One that I had to rehome I had for 8 years, I feel so guilty but he needed a more stable home he was blind and really wasn't handling our previous moves well - he was losing hair like fistfulls. 

All around, it's been a bad time on top of Covid making everything more difficult. 

I'm so overwhelmed.

"I'm not really sure what to do anymoreI've been fighting my entire life and its going no where. I'm 21 now and yet it feels nothing has ever got better, and if it has it was ony temporary. 

I grew up with an abusive grandmother and I developed severe anxiety and very bad ocd centered around avoiding all things her, all things from my home state. Its insane and I just can't shake it and I quite literally have no one to support me.

I stopped living with my grandmother when I was like 25 but my ocd would only ever temporarily subside because my stress would lessen. All I've learned though thia all is that I'm basically an unwanted obstacle for everyone. 

I moved in with my friend and her mom, I just caused problems with my problems and I just never did enough for them. 

And then I moved in with my boyfriend 2 years ago and out relationship is completely broken now. I can't even say I have him. My life is completely broken and I have nothing I can do anymore. He wants to break up and completely disrespects me because all I've done is cause problems with my trauma and all that but I literally have no where to go. I don't have any where to go or anyone I can even turn to.

I'm completely lost and I just want it to end but I dont have it in me to kill myself because I'm afraid of failing and just making things worse or of having physical pain on top of my already cascading mental pain.

"i'm just tired of everythingI have been struggling for almost five years now to make things better and they never get there. They always seem like they might getter better but then the other shoe drops and it all goes to crap again. I keep getting screwed over and hurt and I don't know why I bother to keep trying anymore. It never goes right. It never works.

There's never enough money for me to live, I either have to choose between gas for my car or groceries so I can eat. I barely make rent most of the time. I'm drowning in debt. This week I can't even afford to refill my medication which means I'm going to get hit with withdrawals, which means I won't be able to drive to work so I won't be making any money anyway. Everything's just a downhill drain and it never, ever, ever gets better. I'm stressed and I'm not sleeping right and I keep screwing things up.

I have told myself over and over and over again that if I just keep trying, things will improve. But they DON'T. I've been trying for FIVE. YEARS. So why bother anymore. If anything good happens, I'm always bracing for impact, waiting for the bad thing to come along and yank the rug out from under me. And it ALWAYS comes. 

Been four years since I made my last, pathetic attempt to kill myself. But there are times, like right now, where I really just want to hang myself. Or pull knife out of the kitchen.

Because why bother. This isn't living. This world's burning and will probably be a nuclear wasteland in a few years anyway. Humans suck and I hate them. I don't like myself or my life and I don't see what kind of good I do anyone anyway. I want to go back to therapy but, haha, I can't afford to. I'm terrified of ending up in a psychiatric unit even though half the time I think that's where I belong. Everything is so stupid and miserable and I don't want to be on this stupid planet anymore.

Logically, I know it would hurt people if I killed myself. And I don't want to do that. All I've ever wanted to do in my life is entertain people and make them smile.

But how the hell am I supposed to do that when I can barely find a reason to smile myself.

I'm going to try and sleep for a few hours because I actually have to go to work tomorrow morning so please don't be alarmed if I don't respond to comments right away. I'm not trying anything tonight. I'm too much of a coward. But this is a bad night, a bad, bad night that I just want to make everything stop, to make everything go away. It's a night where I really feel like I'd be better off dead. I hate it here. So why should I bother staying.",1

"Today was one of the greatest days of my life so far. So this year overall sucks. We can agree on that. Me personally I started having a rough year. In January I managed to tear my ACL and meniscus, then COVID hit so even when I could walk again I couldnâ€™t do anything because of the lockdown. My drivers test got postponed and I couldnâ€™t get out of a deep emotional rut for a while. 
Around June however things were looking up. I had completed PT at this point and was able to go lifting again, I took my drivers test, passed and got a job the next day. I bought the truck I have now and have been working on it and making it a great vehicle, Iâ€™m doing decently in school and have made a lot of friends through work. (I was always an introvert and with my job Iâ€™m meeting people that I enjoy hanging with) this eventually led to me being invited to my first Halloween party in close to 10 years and just overall being a happier person.
My dad asked me if I wanted to meet for dinner after work, I said yes and met him at a restaurant near where I work. (Just so yâ€™all know there are no family issues we just donâ€™t see eachother a lot because of work schedules.) after a bit of talking he says how proud he is of me and all the accomplishments Iâ€™ve made this year thus far, and how proud of a dad he is. 

Iâ€™m so happy right now and Iâ€™m so happy my life is taking suck a wonderful turn around!

"I’ll try to hang on for 2 more years.I (17F) have been going through the hardest times of my life. I’ve struggled with extreme anxiety/panic attacks for about 5 years and depression for about 3. I always hoped that things would get better, but it’s gotten worse. I keep losing more and more people/things that I love and at this point I basically have nothing. 

Every time I feel some form of happiness, my OCD (which includes my BDD as well) crawls up and takes it from me. I just want to feel normal again. I crave human interaction but it only leaves me feeling anxious and rejected. I’m starting to accept the feelings of loneliness, which gives me hope. I need to shake my dependence on other people’s approval then maybe I’ll be able to survive. 

At this point, I feel completely empty and exhausted. However, I realize that I’m young and things could get better, even though I highly doubt they will. Because of this small shred of hope, I’ve decided that I will try to wait 2 years to see if things get better before taking my life. Maybe in this time I’ll become such a failure and empty shell that my family won’t even miss me or care that I’m gone. I don’t want to cause them any pain, so this would be fine with me. 

Rant over. Thanks for reading.

"Ethics of Suicide?Let’s discuss it. I don’t think it’s anyone’s right to say you can’t. It’s quite possibly the most basic human right. Maybe if we accept the fact the suicide is a valid reaction, people will stop using it as an act of revenge. Nor would you have to resort to firearms, overdoses, or fucking razors. It’s just an option, that you can safely and calmly take. You don’t like it here? That’s okay man, it’s not for everyone. Boom, assisted suicide then you are done.

I really want to improve our sibling relationship and i try to do nice things for him and speak more kindly to him but he just doesnâ€™t want to be nice i guess. he thinks he is a lot nicer than he really is, and thinks that he does most of the work around the house even though heâ€™s gone all day at school(the rest of my siblings are homeschooled).

What should I do? Would I just have to stop everything and wait for death to slowly take me? Is there a way to live off another while I do minor tasks making just a tiny bit of money to 'survive' on? How can I do this into old age?

It wouldn't be looked at in the same way as suicide and that is something that I'm looking for.

To make my death look accidental is my plan with life to be honest. Because I wouldn't be looked at in the same light and It wouldn't be something that I'm blamed for. 

But all in all, the world is scrambling to pick up the pieces after many disasters happening at once. And I am surprisingly amused when observing the world right now.

"It's all too muchI'm trying to keep my family together but I just don't know how.
So much to say but I don't want to go into detail firstly my mother hates my dad and my grandma for so much they did in the past.

My poor sweet grandma is sad upset and she's going to leave and go to her home country she's where she will be happy however she has to leave her home of many decades.

 This is wrong and I know it but I don't know what to do my mother is irrational angry she says she hates my dad and my grandmother and she makes my grandmother so afraid she often stays locked up at home in her room afraid of saying anything that will and when my mother or rather anger her.

Why does she have to leave I don't want her to. At least she'll be happy in her country but she will always feels sad because she loves me and my brother so much.

  This is one part of a very big problem and I thought I just share this because trying to keep this family together makes me want to die so bad I'm begging to die to escape this I can't feel any more pain I know I can never take never make them happy I just want to die so I don't have to deal with this anymore. I just want to die so badly, why me all of it why me. 

I've only told a very small part of the story but this is the part that just makes me very sad sorry just one part that really makes me sad. If can be honest altogether it's unbearable. All of the injustice.

I haven't gotten into my life passed my home life but that's another story. For now I'm crippled by my sadness of my grandmother feeling afraid and feeling she has to leave.

Why does my grandmother have to go through this. At least she will be happy in some way. I swear Im atheist but I hope so bad there is an afterlife for her and my father. They have had such a hard time with my mean mother I want to know they can have peace one day and be happy. I'd gladly go to hell for them to live happy. I wish I could. ",1

"You're bored, I'm bored, so why not join a modded Minecraft server?  

My friend wanted me to try and get some more people on his MC server, so here I am. The server has up to 60 slots at one time and is a modded server using the latest version of forge. There quite a few mods, but it doesn't take that long to set up (he has a drive link that has them all in one folder). Would anybody be interested? You can get the mods and server info for the server by joining a discord server. You can try the code posted below, but if that doesn't work - no worries. Joining isn't required, but it's there if you want it.

**RULES**

* The server is a factions/anarchy server, so things are pretty lax as far as rules go
* NO BALE FIRE BOMBS. We have a nuclear warfare mod and for Pete's sake, please don't use the bale fire bomb. You probably won't get banned, but you may get some screams of panic when you see how vastly horrible it is
* Profanity and stuff like that is pretty lax, but no racism or homophobia, transphobia, etc. Basically, don't be a dick. We have an in-game voice chat mod.

"That’s probably too long to read.I am an 18 year old boy (soon to be 19). I graduated from school last year in December and since then have spent almost everyday waking up in the afternoon to waste time in my room doing nothing until I fall asleep, usually in the afternoon. I do not want to live but I am too cowardly to take that final step to end it all. I tried once last year and ended up in a psychiatric ward after the hospital for a few days and that was enough to dissuade me from attempting the same method again. I don’t know what to do anymore. I can’t see myself going anywhere in life simply based on the fact that I don’t want to succeed and am contempt with failure. I don’t even know what I aim to achieve with this post but it’s five am and all I can think about is swallowing as many paracetamol tablets as I can. I simply wish I had the testicular fortitude to do it. I hate myself so much. ",1
"It's not that I want to kill myself so much as I want to die.I guess I'll start with that. I don't want to kill myself. At least, I don't want to kill myself with people knowing. I know if I wanted to I could with ease. I've got a Glock 26 on my nightstand, loaded with Hornady Critical Defense rounds. One quick tug from the trigger and I'd be finished. It'd only take a flash of a second and all these feelings would be gone. I could hop in the shower and cut my wrist as I enjoy the last moments of life in warmth.

I love my parents, my girlfriend, my friends and even my coworkers. And that's why I don't want to kill myself. I don't want them to know that, despite all their loving support and time, I still hate myself. I just want to die. It's that time of the year where roads are slick. It wouldn't look all that out of place if I just let go of the wheel and let that truck flatten my car and my spine. But I also know I don't want some poor truck driver thinking he could have stopped it.

I want people to think I was happy. I want to be remembered as that goofy kid who enjoyed the Total War series, Guinness and the History Channel before Ancient Aliens took over. I want my funeral to be a celebration of when I was happy, with Motown playing, lots of drinks and good food. Why? Because it's the one thing I feel I can no longer achieve in life.  And I know if I took my life in a manner that let everyone know I did, it wouldn’t be that.

I'm rambling aren't I? Three paragraphs in and I'm yet to say why I feel this way. That’s not really fair to you is it? You’re here to help me, and I’m wasting your time with my bullshit. So I guess I’ll try and do a short and sweet.

From the outside, everything about my life looks good. I’ve got two parents who love me, a great job at a great company, a girlfriend who is wonderful, no worries about income and if I may say so, I’m not bad looking. 

But it isn’t that way. My parents sit on a teeter-totter of divorce and love. I’ve failed out of collage twice, both times because I become so terrified of failing that I stop going to class. I’m emotionally depended on my girlfriend and I know it. When my friends aren’t in town, she is my only friend in the real world and even then I only get to see her on weekends. Every morning I take enough medicine to start my own pharmacy. And I think worst of all, I’m bored. I’m bored with life.

I’ve considered joining the Peace Corps or even the Air Force as of late. But it’s likely the Air Force won’t take me on account of being medicated and the Peace Corps like College Graduates. Going to class where I am now physically hurts me. I’m so bored out of my mind, and yet I’m terrified I’ll fail. It’s a terrible mixture to say the least. I *know* I could ace every single one of my class, but I just hate being in there. And I’m lonely. Like I said, I have my girlfriend, but outside of her I have a few online friends. I feel like I constantly upset my girlfriend, whether through saying stupid things or doing even stupider things.

I can’t go out and meet people. I would sooner fight a Kodiak bear defending her cub for laughs than try and meet new people. It’s the most terrifying experience I can imagine. It’s worse than when my mother rolled the car on our way to summer camp. And I know my father hates me for it. Hate might be a strong word, but it’s how it comes off. He’s “Mister Big-Shot-CIO” who can schmooze with anyone, and I can hardly talk to my peers.

I just want to vanish. I’m failure in every way, no matter what my mother says. And right now, the only way I could vanish is if I were to be buried six feet under. And the worst part is, I know compared to so many others in the world, my suffering is nothing. There are people in every country and every city that have it a thousand times worse than me, and yet I can’t help but want death. I know there are children in Africa who starve to death and could only dream of having my leftovers. There are kids even in my city who would do anything for warmth my room offers me.

I’m selfish for thinking my life is so terrible. But I think I’ve come to terms that I’m selfish. Selfish, cowardly, helpless and greedy narcissist. ",1

"I don’t know if I’m going to make it through this year, or this monthI have a plan. I haven’t gone through with it because my cousin is over. I think I will once she leaves. I’m tired of being alone. Even when I’m around others I feel like a miserable little bitch, I still feel alone. 

Guess I could say it’s me giving up, I’m just lonely, I’m homeschooled so I’m constantly alone, and when I’m around others it’s my friends from my religion, and all I can think about is how I’ll lose all worth in their eyes once they find out I’m gay. Being alone constantly feels torturous, sorry if that’s over dramatic but I’ve been homeschooled since I was 10 or 11and I’m 15 now. My current goal is to survive till I’m 16 but that’s January 22 so I’m not sure what I’ll do after that. 

Once my cousin leaves I’m gonna go back to being alone and I dont know if I’ll be able to handle it.

"It’s been 1 year since I attemptedI’m supposed to be making pies for my families food swap later today and I can’t get up. I just keep thinking about how much different this holiday would be for my family if I was successful, and how different it ended up being last year. I got out of the psych ward the day before Thanksgiving. 
I’ve worked the past 3 years on both Thanksgiving and Christmas Day just to avoid spending time with them. I’m an only child and my dads still around. He loves me but he doesn’t like me and I’ve accepted that, but with covid It’s really jarring how much I want to spend time with him today, now that I can’t. 
He was there the day I attempted; he left me alone in my grandmother’s empty house after he made me cry to go drink with my uncle. 
I’ve never felt important enough to talk about how I feel with anyone, and I haven’t found a helpful therapist yet. 
There’s still some part of me that wishes I was gone right now, like I think I haven’t improved my life at all and don’t deserve to be here. 
It’s been really challenging to imagine what my family and friends would be going through until today. I just want my dad to hold me and tell me how much I mean to him, but realistically that’s never going to happen. I can’t find enough within myself to validate my presence like I’m suppose to. 
Finally thinking of how this holiday would have changed for everyone I know if I had died is bringing me a lot of emotion. I can’t tell anyone close to me about this so I came to reddit. 
I’m going to continue to stay sober and act happy for my family and video chat my dad today. Happy thanksgiving",1

"I'm so fucking tired of being ignored and unlovedPeople are fake as fuck by and large. I have had this proven over and over again in my 36 years on this shit earth. Platitudes and lame ""We care!"" comments, when the truth is that it is just to make themselves feel better.

On the other hand, I have actually cared about people and invested time and effort, tried to be there however I could for others whether that would just be to lend an ear or offer support in any fashion I could.

When I truly need support, no one is around - no one makes any effort to reach out. I cannot wait until I can finally be free from this bullshit existence. I am so alone.

The only reason I haven't ended it yet is my mother and also the things I need to prepare to ensure my siblings don't have to deal with the fallout (e.g. I want to have my affairs in as much order as possible). The way things are eroding at this point though, I'm at my wits end.",1

I have less than $1000 in the bank, and I owe $2000 to people that need it this week, and I'm under contracts to pay them.

Every thing that was good in my life has turned bad: my job is failing, my money is gone, my friends have deserted me, my family hates me, and I dont know what to do.

Just got the email telling me I didn't get it. No reason.

Also, I recently got a letter from Mind in Bexely, a mental health group here in the UK. I have been on their waiting list for over a year now waiting for a councillor or therapist or whatever to help me, but this letter says because I have not used their services in 6 months my case has been closed. I might be able to get back on the waiting list, but I'm certain if I were put back on, I would start from the bottom all over again.

They asked me questions I would answer and the lady would constantly check in with me to see if I'm ok and asked on a scale of 1 to 10 how I feel because I abused drugs and asked if I was getting home safe or if she needed to call someone to help me, they convinced me to call poison control mid call and to call them back right away. 

The lady even helped me come up with plans on how to become a little happier and gave me information on free therapy businesses. 

I gave her my number so incase I just randomly stop talking it would mean I passed out and she told me she would call 911 for me.

I was afraid because I've heard all these horror stories about suicide hotline but the one I called was so great.

All I'm saying is try... Try and call your suicide hotline even if you're scared, it could help amazingly.

The chemical reactions within our brain that drive us to procreate, a beautiful scientific miracle. Is it really that important or do we just need to evolve, mentally, and get past this unnecessary burden. Then there comes the issue of trust. When you’re ready to commit, why should you? What gives you the right to think that this person will not turn around and fail to reciprocate the feelings you once shared? Bring me to my knees and force me to beg to forces unknown.

Even going as far as to test to see if my closet rack would fall if I tried to hang my self with a belt. I don’t know if this is normal or not. I can’t really tell. That’s probably the worst thing. I just probably need help and I’m scared, it’s hard to admit both of those things. A part of me doesn’t want to ask for help again because it will just turn out like last time. I was in therapy for anxiety and depression around my freshmen year of high school. I got cold feel about it all and told them it was all gone. They believed me. It took a lot of courage to just tell someone who could get me into that therapy that I most likely needed and still need. I just need advice on what to do. Thank you, and I’m sorry.",1

"Insomnia making me suicidalI’ve had insomnia ever since I can remember but the past two months I just haven’t slept. Here and there I get a couple hours. I wanna die. I can’t take this anymore. I have tried just about every sleeping medication there is. Nothing works. I’m in therapy. She doesn’t understand what I’m going through. I’m to the point where I’m becoming paranoid and delusional. No one can help me. I don’t wanna traumatize anyone though, especially my sweet husband. I constantly think about suicide. Even fantasize about it sometimes. I just would love to die... when I’m sleeping. Wouldn’t that be nice. I could finally get some sleep.",1

"I've decidedI'm too depressed and extremely suicidal 24/7 and I can't deal with this shit anymore, so I decided to give myself a grace period until December, I'm giving myself one last chance because honestly I don't want others to suffer the consequences.  So if I don't get better or if I continue to get worse I'll commit suicide in December 25th, because it's the day that Jesus was born, he swore to protect us, but guess what, I have sinned so much that they don't even give a fuck about me anymore. I already have a plan, it's a really horrible plan, which include beheading... well anyways ... guess I'll soon be finally happy or will I be guilty even after death ?

"I don’t think I’ll get to graduateI’m at uni at the moment and my mental health has created endless and repetitive cycles of self destruction and I’m getting none of my work done. I had three essays due at the start of January, none of which ever got handed in and I have a new deadline which I have also missed. Every day that goes by the mountain of work I have to do creates such intense stress and anxiety it makes me physically ill (I’ve had a mix of various colds/abdominal pains/migraines). I skip class because I’m stressed but that only makes it worse. 

I can’t bring myself to admit to others how much I’m struggling and I feel backed into a corner of self loathing and self doubt, fear eating me up from the inside and sometimes when I lie in bed spending another evening completely isolated all I can think about is dying. I don’t know what to do. I can’t tell my partner this, there’s too much on his mind, too much stress in his life to let him worry about me but I know my behaviour makes him unhappy and he keeps asking such pervasive questions of me and I feel like I have no outlet or anyone to hear me.

"Moving OnI'm personally not in a crisis at the moment, I just need a place to dump this to get it off my chest.

Just some background first, I've never really had any experience with suicide up front and personal. I mean, a close friend of my dad's committed suicide a while ago, but that's about it, but I wasn't there to see all the nitty gritty.

So a month or so ago, a girl on this small private Discord community I'm on comes on and heavily hints that she's going to swallow a bunch of pills. Everyone in the call was on disbelief at first, but eventually things got into a panic when we realized she was serious. I myself was shaking the entire time, I wanted to do something, it felt like she was right there but all I could do was sit and listen. She did it all over the call too. Got a glass of water, swallowed every pill one by one and counted out loud while everyone that thought of her as a friend just cried. I can't get it out of my head. I know it may seem petty but it still makes my heart sink thinking about it. She's okay now, and sure as hell seems to be moving past it better than I am. I just hope putting this out there helps, god knows I've tried, but ""just forgetting"" hasn't worked out.

And to anyone going through a rough spot, just know that you're never alone, as cheesy and sappy as it sounds, and that you don't have to take your life to take away the pain. Stay safe.",1

I didn't realise how mentally fucking it was for my sister at that time but now its her turn to shine, she's the pretty one now. She's become more confident and mean now. It' s a vicious cycle. One of us has to take the sacrifice. I wish my parents accepted the abortion. I'm going to suicide I'm not sure when but it'll happen and I can't get talked out of it. I just wanted someone to hear my story. I don't have the motivation to go study or invest in a hobby or make an achievement.

Although she is completely okay now, I have been dealing with issues for a year or more and I have been having a lot of suicidal thoughts, and 2017 has literally been the lowest point of my life so far. I am still a minor, so I talked to my parents about seeing a psychologist or therapist after putting it off for so long, but their reaction makes the entire situation much worse. My mother is not taking me seriously and she think that going to a church will solve all of my problems, but I am not a religious person at all and going to church is the last thing that I want to do. I have told her this, but she continues to make excuses as for why I am feeling this way. My dad also does the same thing, so I am at a loss and I have nobody to go to at this point. We aren't the most wealthy family, and I understand that a therapist can be costly, but my mom insists that if I get one she will have to get rid of some of my really important belongings, which is not a risk I am willing to take since they are all I have at this point. I have no idea how to get through this and I just want to get it over with and kill myself.",1

I am a 36 year old female in the St. Louis area. If you have been here or visited,  perhaps you've felt the misery. Forget all of that and I could tell you so many screwed up things that have happened to me, but right now we are here. What I write may be the last time I ever....I almost wonder if 4chan would be better to write this on.  People cheering me on to end my life. 

I am ill with over exposure to mold. Add that to the health issues I had prior moving into this place in 2013. I am disabled and living here has pushed me. I asked the landlord if any water damage occured here prior to me moving in.  She said none.  I saw nothing odd and of course smelled fresh paint...nothing more or less.  After a week of being here,  I noticed water on the floor panels. Landlord had someone replace them and said I have no idea what that is about. The sliding glass door is broken and the home cannot be properly secured,  so rental insurance is not an option. This part will come in handy later. Over the 3 years of being here,  we have had at least 10 leaks that were fixed but mold left. At first my allergies just flared and I would sneeze or whatever. Now,  nowwww...after being told a new roof would be put on this place since February 2016, it has not happened. With all the rain,  we have leaks in our ceiling with black and green mold with a horrific smell that burns your nose and lungs.  I had to begin taking 3 24 hour Clariton a day and I never needed an inhaler prior to here.  Now I have to use one and none of this really works. I am itchy,  my hair is falling out,  I have found a lump in my breast,  one of our cats died of Cancer just out of the blue...he was healthy prior to. They want rent but will not fix anything. I have nowhere to go,  no friends or family to stay with and no help. I only get 733.00 a month and I don't know if you have seen lately,  but people are asking for 850.00 on a one bedroom in even the bad parts here. There are NO mold laws in this state and it just so happens where I live,  no health dpt either.  No one and I mean no one will help me.  I am already dying from living here,  it is obviously also making me severly depressed because I am sicker than ever and cannot live. My boyfriend is here too and we split expenses. He is an Army veteran,  was in the military 9 years and helped fight a greedy war all to get sh*t on,  because trust me...the VA is of no help unless you have outstanding credit.  He works 3rd shift EVERY SINGLE DAY. We need out of here ASAP but we cannot pay the rent here and have enough to get a new place...if we can even find one.  We have been bullied by the landlords and lied to for this long and I am going to die here. His health is suffering as well. I have had my normal blood work done,  as usual it just came back with high white blood cell count...yet they do not investigate. I have been through hell and back and you only know of what I am telling you now.  The rest is just too long and has nothing to do with poisonous mold,  but it took a toll on me mentally. There really seems no way out of this. Slowly die or take my life is where I am at.  It is going to rain more soon and it will just keep getting worse.  No one comes to even look at the damage...nothing!!!!!! I have pics but I can't capture the horrific smell. The owner of these rentals is notorious for not allowing maintenance to fix anything,  because he does not want to pay for it. He is a millionaire though,  so I am sure his air quality is excellent and he sleeps just fine at night. Well I am tired of it.  I am not living and as I type this,  and the ac is on blowing the smell around.  It is awful. With the hair loss,  which is a symptom of mold toxicity and No it is not my thyroid...had it checked,  I am embarrassed as hell. I wonder if I should just shave it now. I am disgusted.  The other day when it rained,  there was literally a waterfall going down our wall in the living room.  Outlets getting wet,  right next to all of our electronics and part of our couch.  Remember,  I told you we cannot get renters insurance because of the door they won't fix either.  They claimed they ordered it,  but 3 years it hasn't been fixed.  It leaks too. So not only is our health being taken,  our things are too. 

I am sorry for how long and stupid this is.  As I said,  I am alone on this.  I am stuck.  I am already dead.  Justice does not exist and since everyone is so racially bent out of shape here... I AM A WHITE FEMALE.  Race does not f****** matter,  this is health. &lt;-I was asked where I posted this before why I said it and all I can say is... Here, it seems as though you have to always specify. I've lived in other states and this one really takes the shit cake. Anyway,  I doubt I will stay alive for the fact that as I said before... I am dead already here.  I have two cats that I worry about too,  especially after the loss of the other.  This place is sickening and the injustice is the same.  So maybe this is my suicide letter.  A s***** one with errors and not even getting to tell my whole entire story. I have just begged and begged and PLEADED for help with the landlord and nothing. F*** this. What a waste...",1

"Read this for a second.No, it's not a cry for help, I just want to lay out the truth.

I can say many things to you that you would like to hear but, the truth is that people are stop believing in themselves. They judge themselves by thinking how are they going to look to people, but that doesn't matter. The only thing someone else can do about your life is talk. They say that their life's a disaster, well there is know way of calculating that and if someone tells you that you ain't going to anything just smile at them and they will burn inside with their own anger.

I see positivity rarely. People look out for compliments and if they don't get them, they get sad and depressed. But I'll tell you what the biggest compliment is it is to have a positive mind. You'll notice that you feel happy even when you appreciate someone's work and get a thank-you in return.

Instead of focusing on what made you happy or what made you sad, just focus on what you're about to do to be happy and let those people around you talk about you again.",1
"what am i even living for anymoreso i dont know where to start really, but here goes. every day feels like a constant struggle. i wake up, and i just do absolutely nothing. i sit in my house and do nothing. im never hungry anymore, i eat maybe once a day and when i do its barely anything, like a fucking sandwich. each day i basically just smoke weed all day long with 3 ""friends"" that live in my neighborhood. i call them ""friends"" because honestly i dont think i make a difference to them by being there. they only really talk to me when they want something out of me. when i text them, they hardly even answer. sometimes when im with them, and i say something, one of their responses is just ""fuck you"" and nothing else. i dont feel like my parents are there for me, and all i ever do is make my mom feel like i hate her. i dont try to, but its all i ever end up doing. my relationship with my dad is fucked, he cheated on my mom and she kicked him out a few years ago, and now he gives my mom $400 a month for us to basically live on. i have a sister, but i never even talk to her and she never talks to me, i guess she just hates me idk.. as for school, i fucking suck. all of my grades are terrible, but its not  because im stupid. im just too fucking lazy to even do anything anymore, but i dont think it even matters if i try. my parents have no college fund for me nor have they ever mentioned sending me to college, so theres no reason to even get good grades because i dont have a future. at school, i really dont have any friends either. i talk to maybe three people, and im pretty sure they probably hate me. no one really cares about me or notices im even there. theres like one girl who says that im cute, but im pretty sure shes fucking lying to me because i previously kind of ""opened up"" to her about how ive been feeling. she says ""all these people think im so cute and everyone likes me"" but thats a lie. no one even bothers to talk to me ever. i feel like if i tried talking to people i would just fucking bother them by being there and they would just disregard me. i stopped going to lunch, and no one even noticed. its whatever though, because i already expected that. i liked a girl earlier this year, and when i told her my feelings she just completely ignored me, and then started ""going out"" with someone else i know. after a bit of time she started telling her friends i was the one ignoring her and just made me look worse. it doesnt bother me that she doesnt like me, cause its not like i could do anything, but it just goes to show how fucking little i mean to anyone that she couldnt even respond to me. i told my mom about this whole event for some reason, but all she did was laugh when i finished talking. i dont know why i even wake up anymore honestly. i just want to kill myself every day. everyone in my life would be so much happier if i wasnt there. people at school would probably be glad to hear im dead. im sure my family might be sad but i dont even care anymore. im sure they would get over it pretty quickly and just forget about me, just like everyone else in my life. im done trying. fuck everything.",1

"My friend is depressed, can't stop cutting her self, and is considering suicide  
I have a friend that I met over the summer and for the past month or two, she's been depressed but recently it's gotten to a very extreme point. Where I'm starting to feel kind of hopeless and really worried for her.  
I don't go to her school directly but I've talked to her friend who does and she's gotten her a guidance counselor to help her and her parents now know as well (but they haven't handled it the best from what my friend has told me). I've also recommended that she see a therapist and that she seek professional help but she's so far been extremely unwilling.  
She has also (through text) mentioned committing suicide but treats it jokingly and is kind of acting on the borderline of it. I'm not really sure what to think of it, though I do understand that this is something super serious and I've also mentioned this to her friend.  
I'm really lost as to what to do, I feel like I've tried everything i possibly can do from where I am but I know that I have to find a way to do more in order to help her out.",1

I just want to leave this crappy world. The only thing that has made me happy has been illegal substances (Nothing heavy) and I don't want to end up like that. I'm constantly depressed otherwise, have been for 11 years, and I don't believe I can get better. I have to be with people to be happy and I have 2 friends left that are too busy to hang out with me, and I do not have the social skills to just.. make more.

"Online girlfriend wants to suicideI met someone online, and we absolutely love each other now...

The thing is, although she frequently accidentally slips into talking about kids, or what would be her job while she lives with me, she has sort of 'more self aware' moments where she stops herself, and says it is just a nice dream that will never happen.

I talked to her many times about this, and she frequently says she is a 'dead woman', but recently I made her clarify.

I thought she was dead because she was planning to suicide.

Instead, she says she will suicide because she is already dead (I don't understand this phrase at all actually).

Also, she says she refuses to meet me or know my RL name or address for some reasons, and one of them include that she wants to live near her elderly mother until she dies, and then suicide immediately after her mother death.

I know she has self steem issues that is a major driver of many of her problems with me, but those I am already trying to handle for a while.

But I suspect this is something different, I don't know exactly what to do about it, she is a 28 year old woman, that even have her own (rented) apartment, and her job, and her life, yet she feels for some reason that she must live near her mother no matter what and die after her mother is gone.

What I do about that extreme attachment to her mother? I don't know even where to begin to figure what it is.",1

"Stand up straight with your shoulders back“To stand up straight with your shoulders back is to accept the terrible responsibility of life, with eyes wide open. It means deciding to voluntarily transform the chaos of potential into the realities of habitable order. It means adopting the burden of self-conscious vulnerability, and accepting the end of the unconscious paradise of childhood, where finitude and mortality are only dimly comprehended.

"Just feel tiredI never usually post but honestly I just feel alone and want people to talk to. I just feel tired. Tired of crying at nights and then tired of feeling hollow and numb in the mornings. My closest friend stopped talking to me; he needed a break from me from what I’ve said. I’ve said sorry multiple times and texted him but he hasn’t responded. I’m just tired of trying so much. He honestly was the only reason I am living. And now he’s no longer my friend and I dread to be alone. I’m afraid to suffer like this forever or just end up doing it. But I’m still so afraid to do that either. I’ve just been making marks on my body just so I can feel something (that jolt of pain reminds me that I’m alive). But I’m done. I’m tired of acting like my “other self” when I’m around people. I act how I expect I act when around people. I just wanna give up. I don’t want to die or lose my friends but it feels like they’ve given up and are tired of me. I know it’s unfair for me to put it onto them, wanting to be alive. But it happened and without them I have no life. I tried communicating with my best friend but he’s still on his break and shut me out. I just am so tired of crying and being numb and then crying again when something, a trigger realizes that either they are happy anyway without me or that I just don’t want to die. They will be happy that I’m gone anyway. They don’t need a friend like me who also is like this.

"Listen to meThat's all I want. I want to be listened to. I want someone to hear me out and consider what I have to say. I'm so frustrated.

It has become an ongoing theme in my life. I looked around my room today and realized I'm pretty fucking depressed. It used to be meticulously cleaned and organized. I used to take such pride in my beautiful furniture, my beautiful things. Now it's dirty, laced with soda cans. I can't remember the last time I vacuumed. There's dust on my dresser, a pretty thick layer. I don't have the energy to clean.

I might as well be one of those specks of dust - no, even smaller. Small in body, mind, presence. To the universe I am nothing (though I'm sure we all have that thought sometimes). I don't want to continue on if you're not listening, but maybe you are. I find  myself ignored by many people. They pretend to listen but they don't, really. Perhaps they are preoccupied with their own matters. I  would hire somebody to listen, but my dad says I'm not allowed to talk to anyone certified in the art of listening. He says there isn't anything wrong with me. These thoughts I've had of cutting again, of burning my skin with my tiny blue Bic lighter again, of bashing my head into anything I could in a weak attempt to knock myself out again, are all normal (I'm sure everyone has those thoughts sometimes, no?). I wish I had never done those things, because now that I know I can slowly drain away, the action calls me back. So tempting. But, my dad doesn't listen either. 

This is where I need you to listen. I'm at my breaking point. Tonight, right now. I'm not afraid of dying. I have a way out plan. Just please, please listen. I'm alone. Even when I'm around people I'm alone because nobody listens to my wants, fears, goals. I receive orders and instead it is I that does the listening. They tell my happy face that I will be successful, when all I want is to be a mother. They tell me I'll find a nice boy someday, when I like other girls. They tell me I'm strong enough to deal with anything, when my weak wall inside is condemned and decrepit. They tell me I'm normal when I hide my true face (I think my mask may be thicker than most).

I lay here sobbing night after night. I ask the god I don't really believe in why he tortures me, but he isn't listening. But I'm sure a suicide note would speak volumes that might, just might, be listened to.",1
"I'm considering killing myself tonightI've meditated the idea of killing myself for years and I think I've finally reached my breaking point. I basically sexually assaulted my best friend, the only other post I've made is about that. She was fine with what happened and said it was just a mistake but today she said it's actually really got to her. She blocked me on all social medias and her friends said she doesn't want us meeting again for a good while.

Without her and without that friendship group I have literally nothing to live for. They were the only things keeping me going and the guilt I feel from what I did is UNBEARABLE. I don't understand how it's possible for somebody to feel pain on such an intense level. I would break every bone in my body to save me from this if I could. Cutting isn't helping anymore and I think I'm finally ready to crash my car as I've been planning for a little while.

People tell me not to kill myself because it'll hurt others but that only makes me feel guiltier which makes me more suicidal. I would rather be pumped full of morphine or something to make me feel ok for a while but that's obviously not possible so I need to take the messier route.

Does anyone have any advice for getting over the guilt of wanting to die?",1

"Should I Kill Myself?Okay well let me explain a little bit about my life to know why I am asking this. 
I have a normal life and I live with my mom, dad, and sister. But the thing you need to know is that I am a VERY socially awkward person. Ever since I was in elementary school I was picked on because I was shy and different from most people. I was glad when I left the school. Now I am currently 17 and in my Senior year. High school has been a bit of a step up as I am no longer being harassed but I am still very lonely. I've never had a REAL friend before. I've only had a few people who I have actually gotten along with and have had conversations with but I either never get to really see them again or they have moved on to somewhere else. I don't think the kids at my school really even care about me much. Sometimes people just walk past me without ever telling me ""hello"", even when I look upset some of my fellow classmates don't even care. Whenever people DO ask me what's wrong they only tell me a few nice things just to make me feel better. The people who do ask just carry on with their lives. I don't even get invited to most social outings. I really don't feel important when it comes to my peers around me and I don't think I would fit in with many other people at my school. I think the only friend I pretty much have right now is my older sister and it's not like I have her to talk to all the time. I know I am not the best at conversations but maybe if people gave me a chance and got to know me better maybe people would see me more than just some quiet, shy girl. Too many people I know really act obnoxious, loud, and seem to have different interests from me. I have been getting really depressed over time about the fact that I can't make any real friends and I was beginning to think about killing myself. I was planning to do it tonight but at the same time I don't want my family members to get sad and depressed now if I do this. What do you think about my life? Should I kill myself or do I have a chance at getting things better for me in the future?",1
"Am I really suicidal?I don't truly consider myself suicidal, so I'm not sure if I should even be posting here.

The thing is, I have a lot of dreams and ambitions for the future. And I have no intention of ever killing myself because it is a very scary thought to me. But these thoughts are still disturbing to me, and never seem to completely go away.",1
"Life's a BitchSince more than 5 years ago, my life has been quite interesting as many people say. Traveling a lot, working at many places, meeting a lot of people, but I still feel that hole in my chest, that feeling that I'm not good enough in anything, and I just want to quit living.

"I’m at a point where I hate my life. I don’t even want to live anymore. I just hate being alive.I’m not writing this in anger, but in sadness. Being alone all your life. Having people tell you hurtful things. I don’t even want to talk to other people because they’ll think I’m “attention seeking” or “fake”. 

Growing up I was the punching bag for my brother, literally. He’d throw slurs at me and slam me into the wall, leaving me with bruises. My father would even hit me and my mom. I hate it when people say you should depend on family. I hate family. They aren’t worth anything to me. 

Friends aren’t worth anything either, you tell them you’re problems thinking that they’ll be there for you but they turn their backs and stop talking to you. 

I put a smile on my face so people assume I have no problems and that I’m always happy. But for me, it’s a defense so that no one can really know how I feel. 

My family calls me “fake”. But I act the way I do because they treat me like I’m worthless. At school I can be who I really am because I don’t have that same weight on my shoulders. But if that makes me fake then so be it. 

There’s just so much hate inside of me. Growing up in a toxic household has made me hate everything in my life. I don’t think I’ll find happiness. I’m so tired of trying to hold on and trying to be happy. But now that I’m stuck at home, my life has been living hell. I can’t take it anymore. I’m so tired of everything and everyone.",1

I have Asperger's Syndrome, and have been prone to OCD stresses throughout life, though I've never been formally diagnosed. Things have been very stressful for me over the last year and a half; an old friend committed suicide, and I found out that an ex teacher is a pedophile. In addition, I was objectified by three different people and a subsequent online relationship fell apart, and it was all too much. I have Asperger's syndrome, and I've always exhibited obsessive compulsions when feeling stressed, such as opening/closing doors a certain number of times, or insisting to myself that I walk while thinking 'good thoughts'.

Eventually, my disgust with the treatment of women and a shame that I was complicit in it, as well as horror towards what my teacher did to others, made me scared of being around children/babies. I’d actively avoid them in supermarkets, and obsessively started putting my hands to my shoulders when out in public and at home, avoid eye-contact with them or photos of them and just not want to be near them, because it reminded me of the worst parts of humanity. The false memories originated here, where, my brain would lie to me and say I’d touched myself inappropriately at this place or at this time, and it would sometimes take hours/days to reassure myself everything was fine and here’s where I was stood and here’s where my hands were, etc.

This has led me to perpetually isolate myself even more, and not want anything to do with the outside world. At some point on I think a Monday or Tuesday evening in the second week of September 2019 after moving in, I basically watched pornography for like 2-4 hours intermittently when my depression was as its height. I would go from grinding against the bed to then sitting up and watching interviews and random videos on YouTube, and one of the videos was a video of Kurt Cobain and his 2 year old daughter and the way my brain has misremembered that is that I somehow pleasured myself to this, which I didn’t.

I remember watching another video of porn afterwards and only then did I kneel down to grind again, but with the video loaded. Afterwards, I remember going to the homepage and watching a video slideshow of his daughter through the years and feeling so much guilt for watching porn, more so than ever and the way my brain sabotaged me was to overlap what would otherwise be two separate actions of YouTube then porn. I remember going to the sink afterwards and gipping, processing it through in my head immediately afterwards and feeling comfortable enough that I hadn’t done anything wrong and so I left it.

This didn’t reappear again till May 2020, then again this week on Tuesday night, and so I wonder if I did do it, and I just repressed it, or I didn’t and actually it’s just a false memory. Now, the worry reappeared at the end of Tuesday when my brain didn’t have anything else to worry about. I know that in my heart I didn’t do anything wrong, as I listened to Nirvana plenty of times afterwards, and didn’t feel pangs of guilt or shame that I know I would’ve if I’d done what my brain tells me I did (or anything wrong, at all). The false narrative that my brain builds up is, ‘well, you’re a psychopath/sociopath/pedophile, and that’s how you were able to suppress the memory for 8 months’.

I know I didn't do anything wrong, it was just that I watched porn and switched to YouTube back and forth, which I never do before, as I usually go for a shower after watching it. I feel a tightness in my throat and stomach, but then it goes when I rationalise it, but then it comes back. 

My brother says that he knows I would never do anything like that, and it's just that all those things have collapsed on me.

What do you think?",1
"The person I'd thought I'd be isn't going to happenI have spent my entire life building up around this image of what I wanted to be. I'd join the army, I'd become the first woman to pass special ops training. If that didn't happen then at least I'd be serving my country like I always wanted. When I started getting pain while exercising I changed my plans. Police force would be my goal. After several years I'd work toward becoming a detective and help the local community. Pain got worse.

I can now barely walk. People used to describe me as street fighter tough. Haven't been able to walk in the last couple months and I'm in pain most of the time. The kicker is that, after physical therapy and mri's, no one can figure out what's wrong. Am I purposefully sabotaging this woman I wanted to be in my head? I never wanted to be a mother or a caretaker. I wanted to be a guardian and it's fading. Everyone always tells me that, ""you're so smart, you can accomplish anything."" Well I'm piss drunk and realizing I don't want to do anything, I wanted to do what I wanted.

I spent my life building myself around this image, my major was planned around this image, everything I am is in this image. What's the point if it can't be achieved? There is literally nothing of me beyond it, this is all I am and it's very likely that's it's gone. I'm a burden on my family at this point and I'm weak. I can't see myself working a 8 hour office job. I wanted adventure and risk. I'm getting none of that. ",1

"At the end of the yearI made he decision to end my life by the end of the year, if I make it that long. I'm so tired of being alone. At first I was fine with it but as time went on I realized I don't want to be alone anymore. I want someone to love and love me back. 

But lately my loneliness is getting worse. I feel in love with a girl at work. The thing is I did not attend to fall for her. When I first saw her I wanted to ask her out but because I'm so shy and have such low self esteem I did not, I figured she would say no anyways. Later on we became friends and started making plans to hang out. She likes horror movies almost as much as me so we decided to go see just horror movies together. After the movie was over and i was driving her home we started talking. She told me that she is suicidal, I told her I was too. And that is when we became even closer friends. She would tell me that if I ever needed to talk she would be there for me. 

The thing is I cant really talk to her about anything because lately she is all I think about. I want to tell her how much I love her and I want to be with her but I cant, because she is already in a relationship with someone and engaged to that person. If I tell her how I feel now I know she well possibly freak out and end the friendship that I cherish so much. When I am around her all the feeling of depression and anxiety go away. When I am alone I think about her and I start to cry. It feels like I have separation anxiety when i am not with her. 

A month ago I decide to look for someone to have in my life so I tried online dating. It was a bust and just made me realized that I am not attractive enough for this. So I decided to end my life at the end of the year. I'm in the process of selling my things and writing letter to my closest friends, which I dont have as much anymore. The money that I get from selling my stuff I'm going to give it to the only girl I ever fell in love with. The reason being without giving to much information is that she cant work very much because of a disability, she can barely afford to get gas. With the money she can catch up on bills and use the rest to a future with the person she plans to spend the rest of her life with. 

Most people that will comment may say this is foolish and you maybe right. But I dont have anyone in my life and I am miserable all the time. I lived my life so far for myself, I would have never done this for anyone other that I person I care about. And she is the only person I ever wanted to care for. I waited a long time to find someone like her but she is already with somebody else. I will never find another like her. ",1

"26, Major Tragedies in Life, No Options, No Money, No FutureThis is going to be a long one, but I'll try to keep it coherent. Here goes:

I'm 26, live on the East Coast in a rural area. I quit my job in Sept of last year, I claimed workplace abuse to my friends, but it was more that I had been written up, hadn't improved, and didn't want to get blackballed from my industry of choice (system administrator).

I've lived with my father for the past 5 years, and we get along, but I've constantly disappointed my family. My father was expecting me to be the golden goose of my brothers and sisters, but instead I became the dropout, the mooch, the one who didn't do anything useful with his life. All I have in my life are my aging grandparents, my mother (whose a narcissist who can't help it, and perpetually broke), my father, and a few friends. 

Two weeks ago, I got into a major car accident, totaled my car, and I was hoping the guy responsible would be on the hook, but his insurance pulled a fast one and I'm left without options. Attorneys won't take up my case because they say his ins has successfully screwed me. I'm suffering back pain. I was working doordash, and no longer have the means to do that without a car. I have no income, my father is getting antsy since I'm at home all the time trying to lick my wounds. I have no recourse for that. 

On top of that, I can't go back to my job area with the current pandemic. I cannot work from home, because the work life balance causes me to break down from stress. Losing the ins case has worsened my finances. I have some money I've hid away in case of bankruptcy, but it's not enough to start over, esp with no car. 

I live in a rural area where I have no friends nearby. It's the same town I grew up in (I left years ago, but came back) and I was bullied badly in high school, so I have nothing here for me other than family. 

I have no romance. I left an unhappy relationship 2 months ago, where I was being forced to do things I didn't like. The woman I was courting now sees me as a useless wreck in the wake of these tragedies. I'm unattractive, overweight, bitter. 

So, I'm destitute, unable to work, depressed, feeling useless, and without hope. I don't expect you guys to have the answers, but I'm feeling suicidal. I don't know what to do, and I see no way out of this without begging family to help, and frankly the guilt over being a disappointment CRUSHES me. 

Just... please listen. That's all i ask. In my time of need.",1

more readyim ashamed to even be posting in here again but whatever. I'm almost 30. I finally mentally fell off a cliff and theres nothing left. ive been struggling through school trying to get a degree since high school finished lol. and this time i had less motivation and energy than ever and quit after like 2 days. its been like weeks and i havent told anyone. parents just paid like 10k for this. cant face them again after doing this again. Been in love with 1 girl my whole adult life and lost her because i cant take care of myself or make a living or help support her and a family. So she had her parents arrange a match for her and shes getting married in a few months. shes indian its a culture thing. I'm delusional and think she still loves me but it doesnt matter because its all over anyway and shes signing papers in a couple months. I cant be friends with her cuz she just wants to talk about her boyfriend but ive tried leaving and ignoring her and it doesnt work either. we end up talking so much and being close and caring so much and we dont want to leave. But we cant be together. It isnt possible to live like this anymore. Ive told her i plan on killing myself in a few weeks when my parents are gone. i really hope that i can find the determination. Maybe if things were different and i was a stronger person and had a future or a career or even a job or if i had ever found anyone else that i loved like this or who loved me like that.. maybe if i was younger and still had time to change or get lucky..maybe if my parents werent almost 70 and way overdue to retire already and stop supporting me.. maybe then i would feel like giving it another shot. but im just fucking done. life isnt fair. i wont watch my soulmate give herself away to some other guy just because she couldnt find anyone else. while i sit here knowing ill never be able to take care or a partner or raise a family. Whats the fucking point of going on when thats the only thing i ever wanted? I spent years in therapy not knowing what i wanted out of life and when this girl appeared in my life again i marched into my therapists office said i know what i want and its to marry this girl and i still feel it with ever fiber of my being. Im sorry theres just no coming back for me anymore,1

"Feeling like taking my life for a whileThe whole wave of negativity started about 3 months ago, when I failed two main exams at school. After this unfortunate event, many others followed. For some reasons, my colleagues grew distant from me. I sort of drifted to the edge of society, being labeled as a ''creep'' and an outsider. Every time I'd attempt to start a conversation or approach a girl would result in a shameful 
failure. I would try to set goals, but I always failed them and ended up having only bad days. As such, I've been resorting to the Internet for solace, because you can be accepted for who you are.

I'm even failing at that, too. Even online, I simply cannot make one interesting post, as all of them are regarded as stupid and labeled shitposts. Every time I attempt to post in a subreddit, somebody calls me insane, I cuss them and then I get banned. This convinced me that I am socially incompatible. At school, everybody thinks I'm a loser and picks on me. In fact, I believe that I'm a loser, because all I ever do online is write ridiculous stories (which often don't hold and I get called out for being a liar) because my life is so pathetic and boring. I have officially came to the conclusion that EVERYTHING that I'm doing is absolutely useless. Nobody cares about my dumb history facts, nobody cares about my even dumber sympathy for the USMC and nobody cares about my shitty life. I'm too ashamed to talk to my parents about this (as they'd probably punish me), and I can't talk about it to a counselor. Since I am failing every single time at something, I feel like a worthless shit. But then I think how easy it would be to grab a knife and finish my pathetic self off. Maybe that is what I should do, and I'll get rid of all the hate and malice that this world has to offer. With my low self-esteem and non-existent confidence, I feel like I don't have a direction or place in life, so why shouldn't I just end my misery?

But then again, some smarty pants will come and take down this post for ''trolling''. Do whatever you please with this post. The only reason I came here is because random users, who desperately pleaded for me not to take my own life, told me that this is a place where someone would give a f*ck about my problems. ",1

"I don't know where to go from here without killing myself.I need to start this out by saying that I know everything I'm about to tell you is my fault. I fucked up so hard and it makes the idea of coming clean and asking those who care about me for help so hard. I also know that I have a disgustingly large support net and I'm sure it makes me despicable to some of the people in here who think or know they have no one.

So, everything started a few years ago when I got out of the military. I went home to live with my parents while going to school to get a degree using the GI Bill. Things were going well, I had a 4.0 and was driven af while attending community college in my hometown. Then I got accepted for transfer to a 4 year college out of state. My parents were super supportive, offered to help me pay for rent on top of what the GI Bill was paying so I could focus solely on school. Helped me find a place and move in. Did fucking everything for me. Everything looked fantastic. 

I know what happened after that, but I still don't understand HOW it happened. 

That's a lie I understand the how I just still don't want to admit my weakness but shit that's why I made a throwaway and am drunkenly making this confession. 

Suddenly, I was alone. In a place where i had no connections to literally anyone. I also had somehow changed from my social butterfly extreme extrovert youth to having social anxiety while still being an extrovert at heart. It definitely didn't help that i was much older than 95% of the people going to school with me and 99% of the people in classes with me.

I fucking spiralled. I went from drinking a couple nights a week to drinking 10 or more beers a night just to sleep. I've always been an alcoholic but it got seriously bad. I failed most of the classes my 1st quarter, but instead of admitting weakness I told my parents, friends and family I was doing GREAT! I just couldn't admit my problems.

To make a long ass story short this happened my second and third quarter as well. I am, unfortunately, a fantastic liar and managed to keep anyone from finding out what was really going on.

All the fails resulted in me getting an academic suspension. I'm now out of school for two years. This would be the point where most people came clean but I just couldn't fucking do it.

I kept the lie going. I lied throughout summer and then kept lying throughout this whole school year, pretending I was going to school.  I've made barely enough money working a side job to keep my lie going while doing everything I can to not think about every fucked up thing I've done(including drinking myself to sleep every god damn night) but it's been a fight to stay above water because I'm too fucking stupid and depressed to just get an actual job. I've sunk into massive debt and am starting to reach the point where I can't keep the lie going anymore. 

I know I could come clean to my parents and they'd almost definitely help me out, but I don't think I can take the disappointment I'd feel from them. I know I'm disgustingly privileged because my parents literally could just deal with all my problems if they wanted to but this is still where I'm at. Just the thought of their disappointment has me seriously contemplating suicide to avoid it. I'm pretty sure that actually facing it would make me do it regardless of how much they love me and I don't know how to escape this trap I've built for myself. 

I'm obviously a broken fucking cog, and I don't think I deserve to or can be fixed. I had so much opportunity and I squandered it all and it just fucking hits me. Why the fuck shouldn't I just end it?",1

But all the support everyone else was leaving in their comments for the OP's who came out for help on here, I want to say thank you because that really helped me also.

I haven't thought about killing myself for a couple months now, and I realized this a few days ago and I felt a joy that I haven't felt in so long that I had almost forgotten that such a feeling existed.

So thank you. Please everyone on here that are helping others who is still stuck where I used to be, keep doing what you all are doing. The difference you can make really is life and death.",1

"Been contemplating doing it for two months, feeling really awful right nowI'm not going to delve in to back story, but if you care you can look at my post history.

Basically, I drove away a girl I was seeing because I semi-threatened her with suicide (not really, I just called her a few times telling her I was suicidal). She said I've made her really uncomfortable and told me to stop contact her, but I kept contacting her. I've since stopped, there's no point continuing that. I feel disgusted at myself and the whole situation. It's vile and has fucked up my view on women and relationships.

I don't have a job, at least not a proper one (I'm an Uber driver). I have a Bachelor's degree in Arts, but my full time job prospects look pretty grim. I'm scared of entering the job market and feel like a child in this sense.

I have friends, but they don't really reach out to me. I've tried reaching out to them and they can only help so much. I understand this.

I spend a lot of time sleeping now, or just laying in bed thinking about it. I'm not eating properly. I feel like shit. Sometimes I can see why suicide is not the way, that there is hope for me to change my life around and become the person I used to be or someone even better. But most of the time I'm just drowning in my own sadness. Every day is lonely. Every day I think about everyone else going about doing their job while I just sit at home reading this and other subreddits like it. It's a fucking sad existence. I don't think I really, truly want to kill myself, I just don't want this life I currently have. I think a lot of you could relate if you read just these last few sentences.

"How can I kill myself without burdening other peopleI've been suicidal for quite some time and I walk around with a note in my wallet. People think I'm really successful in my career but its all bullshit and its nothing I'm passionate about. I fell in love with a guy who I was dating, and we broke up, which was fine, we stayed friends for much longer than we dated.  A few months ago he invited me to a party where he was the only person I knew, and everyone was very drunk, and I fell asleep on a futon with him. The whole party decided I was coming onto him and that me drunkenly falling asleep with my arm around him was ""assault"" even though I asked ""is this ok"" and he said it was fine. And it was cold. And I don't remember much else. But I'm a tiny girl I barely weigh 120 I dont know how I could have assaulted him but I feel awful every day since. 

its been months and I haven't been able to do anything. I cry every day. I feel that I was very depressed and unhappy before but now that guy is visiting my city and didnt even tell me he was coming, even though we've stayed semi-friendly. 

I dont feel suicidal because of him I just feel like this is the catalyst for something that I've been struggling with for a long time. I'm 27 I travel so much for work that I dont even know where I live anymore, and my friends are all scattered. Ive moved as high up in my company as I want to, and I hate it, and I want to quit, but if I do, I'm 27, Im too old to start a new career and what the fuck would I do anyways. I'd be broke. I am broke. 

In January my roommate passed away and his family thinks it was natural but I'm 90% sure he killed himself, but he had a lot of chronic illnesses so he had access to meds. Oh yea, I cant fucking get my insurance to pay for therapy so I'm done trying.

I want to kill myself and I'm sure of this, completely. But, if I jump in front of a train, then people's daily commutes get messed up and the train driver is scarred for life. If I hang myself, people have to find me. If I shoot myself, there will be tons of blood when they find me. If I take pills it may not work? I could jump off the GWB but people still have to find me and I dont want my death to inconvenience anyone

I’m in so much pain tonight. I’ve never cried like this in my whole life. I think if I were to do something, I would just leave so much more of a mess for my loved ones to clean up.

"Considering itWhen i was around 13 years old, my parents where getting divorced,in that moment it was just the worst thing that ever happened in my life, our whole buisness went belly up because of my dad, my mom and him always argued very strong, and my life was just a shit storm with no end, this was the first time i had considered it...but one cousin of mine was one step ahead of me. My grandma and i found her hanged in the bathroom, i just craped my pants, i cant remember much of that day, it devastated my whole family, i remember my mom hugging me and telling me to never make that stupid choice, and for many years, this event, my cousins death was just like my light in the dark, every time i wanted to end my life,  always thought about her and how it fucking teared apart my family. Its ben 14 years since that...and its harder and harder for me to stay straight out of that thought.
I have no girlfriend in the past 7 years, no one to cares about me, and for many years i just battled it, i told myself to just calm down, that someones coming, and yes, some girls have come, but its just been mean spirited people, some even more damaged than I am, i have this thought every day that I'm a horrible person. Any way, my life is just....empty, i wake up feeling like shit, feeling ugly, fat and dumb, then i look in the mirror and confirm it. I study music, and I fucking suck, for some time it gaved me the calm i needed, but now i just cant stand me, i study hard and fail so much, my teachers must hate me for sucking so much, i just have a hard time convincing myself to be better but i just cant, and thats the other thing, my music, since i started people where always surprised whe i told them that i study music, is just rare in my country, and some people always say that i will starve to death, because theres no jobs for that here....i have battled this with positive thinking and studying harder, but now....is just like a posible future and it freaking scares me, how can i be such a pussy. Anyway, i dont think i have the balls to do it, but somehow it freaks me out that after 14 years of my cousins death, i'm considering it again. And here I'm, sorry for the long text and my bad english, but if theres anyone there, i just need to talk",1
"Sort of ventingHi, well this is going to be a wall of text so I don't blame you for not reading it, I just want to get this off of my chest, I never have before

I've never been diagnosed with depression, I've never talked to anyone about it, maybe I'm just a narcissist who is sad all the time I don't know. But I do feel ""sad"" a lot, around 6 years I've felt a numbness in the back of my mind which comes and goes as it pleases. I remember being around 12-13 years old and crying/praying to God to take me in my sleep, I didnt want to live anymore, and waking up the next day, and the day after, and the day after that was part of the reason I stopped believing in religion. I was lonely, I was bullied in school by my ""friends"", but I stuck by them because they were all I had. Eventually things did get better, I made new friends, my confidence grew and the want to die did go away.
Up until about 2 years ago I was ""ok"". My best friend (no longer, she was a horrible person) stopped wanting to hang out with me and spend time with her boyfriend instead. The kicker is that her boyfriend was also one of my best friends and I was infatuated with him, so you can see how fun that time was (for the record I never cheated with him, but she assumed that we had something going, even though I was his friend long before I knew her). I live quite far away from the rest of my friends, and so hardly seen the rest of them, I still barely do, perhaps once a month at best?
Currently I'm 18 and I'm just tired of living, to be honestly it's not living I'm doing anymore, it's ""surviving"" and honestly I'm horrible at it. I dropped out of Uni a few weeks ago because I hated what I did, and now have no idea what I want to do with my life. I have a part time job in retail and that's not what I want to do for the rest of my life, but it's looking more likely as I'm such an undecided person, that's if I even get back into university, I have to take a year out. Life to me now is a haze of staying up until 3-4am playing video games, sleeping until 12, rinse and repeat. Games make me feel like I have a sense of purpose, they fill time and allow me some escapism, I'm a terrible daydreamer, but I prefer living in a fake reality.
Honestly the only thing that's stopping me from hanging from a tree is my family. I just wish that my parents hated me, I want them to hate me so badly that the thought of losing me won't bother them, but honestly it will kill them. My dad has bad mental health, he suffers from bad anxiety and PTSD (resulting from traumatic past, we live in a shitty country which had a bloody 30 year period). I just can't hurt them, but the thought of having to continue like this is too overwhelming. They're so dissapointed in me from quitting Uni, they sort of support me of course, but compared to the rest of my star cousins I'm just the dropout, the disappointment of the family. I feel so out of place with my family, they're so different from me, outgoing and happy, and what they say can hurt ""You need to go out more, meet a boy etc"" and those sorts of things, it hurts because I know it's true and because mostly they just pity me and I don't want them to. My mother forces my cousins to invite me places, it's just fucking embarrassing. I do have friends, albeit only around 2-3, but I never make any effort, and I don't blame them for not making any effort with me.
I've never told anyone about what goes on inside my head, my mum has some idea, bringing me to the doctors who lovingly just diagnosed me with a bad case of PMS. My friends have no idea, the only one I have ever told is my former best friends Boyfriend, he suffers from depression and is on anti-depressants etc but we have stopped speaking as of recently, he has a great social life etc and I don't blame him for wanting to cut me out
I'm going on holiday in July with my friends, which is one thing to look forward to. But hopefully by the end of the summer I won't be here anymore. Last year I promised myself if I didnt get into Uni, I'd do it, but I did and I was so so so happy, I thought my life would change, I achieved something. But no, I'm still stuck in this rut I have been for 6 years, I have nothing to live for, I'm just a waste, when I die my organs will be donated so that some poor person who really deserves this life can carry on, at least I can give some happiness and joy to the world that way.

"Please help me. Suicidal Thoughts vs. Daydreaming about winning the lotteryI am a 29 year old college drop out. My transcript is 4 years, 5.5 Failed courses, and the last 1.5 years I withdrew from all 8.0 courses. My daily life for the past 6 years consists of waking up at random time of the day, sometimes when it's already dark outside, putting the laptop beside my bed on my chest, and from the moment I open my eye to the moment I fall asleep, I am in the same position in bed on the computer looking at twitter/instagram/reddit/youtube to distract myself. My parents think I graduated and make almost 6 figures and have friends and am dating. I showered once a month, ate takeout pizza or managed to get out of the house once every 2 months to go to the grocery store. I would day dream about celebrities or me winning the lottery or someone falling in love with me and saving me. I would think about other people's love and cry everyday, full on sob. I had no job, did not get welfare or help and lived a poverty life where I made myself anemic. 

Then about 3 weeks ago, I could no longer sleep 14 hours a day, woke up at 6am everyday. I had all this time to think about my life and once I looked up the symptoms of depression and anxiety,  I went to the doctor to get diagnosed. I've been on antidepressants for a week. I made a resume and applied to barely above minimum wage jobs, and got one. I went to free counselling in the city. I called my friends who I haven't talk to in a decade. I called my old college and it turns out I can go back anytime. Everyday I flip flop between wanting to kill myself and ""I can do this"" about 34 times. I'm confused to if I'm getting better or worse. Now life is harder, I'm sadder, I have anxiety attacks, chills, suicidal thoughts, huge mood swings, from the moment I wake up. Every morning I wake up with so much regret and suicidal thoughts. At least before when I was in bed I can be in a state of denial.

I have to decide this week whether I should:

\- go back to my prestigious college and finish a basic unemployable degree (3 years)

\- college and I would need to achieve 2 years with 3.8 GPA, to apply to business school with my horrible transcript, and start entry level jobs at age 32 making 40k (4 years if i'm lucky)

\- college and take sciences class from year 1 and aim for 3.8 GPA, and then apply to med school with my horrible transcript, and by some miracle if I get in age would matter less and I can finish at age 36 (6-8 years if a miracle happens)

\- work at my $30,000 job this year, my first paid job since high school, and take an art class in community college

\- study for my insurance license and work for no base pay all commission have to motivate myself

\- tell my parents and they will probably make me move home and do nothing this year

If you are asking me what I like, I don't like anything I have no passion for life. I expect to fail in college, but I don't want to work at my new job because I know I'm capable of more. Writing out all my options makes me think about how much work each one is and makes me want to stop existing. 

I wish I had a therapist but I can't afford one. If you are a doctor, therapist, or counselor, or someone in a similar situation that's recovered that's willing to help please message me. I will be forever grateful",1

Tonight I just want to end it all. I'm constantly tired, and I'm sick of fighting for a future where I'll be depressed until the day I die from an accident, suicide, or sickness. I get virtually no joy out of life. I've been suicidal as long as I understood what death is. I've searched for help, had diagnoses, and been medicated. What I take now has helped sometimes, but I've been really struggling lately, and I don't think it's ever going to get better. Tonight I strongly considered \[and still might\] a few things:

1. downing a bottle of beta blockers, chasing it with a bottle of tequila, and smoking weed till I'm unconscious.

I'm not looking for any help, I don't want to call a fucking hotline, I don't want to think about my loved ones, I don't want to think about my future. I just want to die now, or wait till it happens on my own.

Why?I came here to get help with some problems so I said a lot of things... And person on here was helpful in their replies when I talked of things in really general terms. It gave me some hope and it helped.  But today once I said some details they went and deleted every post they put.. Including information on a site I wanted to refer to again for help.  Why was I abandoned?  Was what I said so very awfull.. Worse than other peoples issues here?  It kinda made me feel worthless ya know... And more alone.,1

"Its getting harder to take this everydayI can’t stand just always thinking about death and how I’m going to end it. I just can’t stop the thoughts of hurting myself and convincing myself I deserve it. Every time I see anything sharp I think of stabbing myself, every time I see cars going fast I think of jumping in the way, every time I take a pill I feel urged to take so many more. When a train comes by I feel like I have to close my eyes and lock my legs and look the other way because I just don’t know if I’ll be able to have the willpower to stay still if this keeps on going. I just constantly think about hurting myself and it’s driving me crazy, I feel like I need to, like it’s some type of itch. I think there’s two people inside of me, one that just is obsessed with hurting the other, and the other, a meek and cowardly personality that could be successful if it weren’t for the relentless beat downs that the other me gives it. I’m not sure if I’m willing to do it, but part of me ones to get rid of the other. But it’s more of an intrusive thought than anything else, it’s just something that doesn’t let me sleep, it’s just constantly on my back like a parasite. I don’t know. Just really hope I can get some advice at stopping these thoughts. I really wish the best for all you guys.",1

"I just feel worthless I guess?Edit(Pre-Edit? I don't know what to call this, I wrote this after writing this fucking rant, Idk):I'm sorry, this turned out to be just a huge rant. I don't open up to people, I don't know how to structure posts like this, I just need to uncork the bottle. TL;DR Sad wagie is upset he doesn't stack up to his expectations of himself.

For context, my life isn't that bad. I grew up in a stable family, I wasn't abused, I mean I was bullied I guess but who wasn't? I hate my job. I'm basically just cleaning up after other people, but at least it's a job. I can afford to rent a little roach-infested house that I'm fighting to try to keep clean, but that's more than what some people have to work with. I can afford food for me and my dog, who I love dearly and feel like he's 90% of my emotional support with me telling myself to just man up being the other 10%. I can afford clothes, utilities, gas, and I have a little left over each month that I can save up and buy computer parts and video games. I have friends that I could probably open up to with stuff like this if I didn't love them so much that I didn't want to burden them with this stupid shit. My family probably would freak out if they knew how often I was on a ledge, but I know they'd care, even if it's just because they're obligated to as my family. I don't have it that rough. I shouldn't feel this trapped or overwhelmed. 

I just... expected more from myself for being in my late twenties. There's this crushing sense of hopelessness because I'm almost thirty and I still don't know ""what I want to be when I grow up."" The things I'm passionate about seem so disparate from things I could actually make a career out of. I like animals, but I can't handle seeing them injured, so childhood dreams of being a vet went out the window when I realized how many sick and injured dogs I'd have to see. I like books, but I'm not creative enough to write anything. I don't have any real skills or talents outside of that. Honestly I feel like a really underwhelming person in general when compared to the average person. My coworkers just seem more competent than me when you put us side by side in every regard. I get told I'm funny, but what the fuck is that worth? I can make other people laugh while I'm dying inside? What kind of sick fucking joke is that? It's just a stupid act to cope with the fact that being around people makes me so uncomfortable I could crawl out of my skin and hide in a crack in the baseboards. Like it's the only way I've figured out how to ""fit in"" with people outside of my inner circle. Don't even get me started on trying for a relationship. It's been 6 years since the last one I was in and it left me with trust issues. Like, she wasn't a bad person, just said a lot of beautiful things she shouldn't have said if she didn't mean it. I don't open up to people any more. I don't let myself be vulnerable anymore. I'm emotionally incapable of it. I'd never write anything like this on my main account, let alone *say* half this shit to someone. 

Lately it's gotten worse. I'm stuck at this point where I want to figure out what would make me actually happy. They say everyone has a talent or a purpose, right? That there's something you're good at and you just have to figure out what it is, but I really thought by now I'd have found it. Being able to spout obscure Lord of the Rings lore isn't a talent. It's.. just a nerdy hobby.. obsession.. thing. I want to progress but I don't know how. I could quit my job, find something else, but what if it turns out different than I expected and I hate it too? I'm still right where I was but now I've lost insurance and any other benefits I've built up. And if the money is worse than I just hamstringed my entire living situation. 

There's obvious changes I can make that would make parts of my living situation better; cook some cheap meals at home that are better than the sad hotpockets or sandwiches I normally eat. Work out, clean the house more, get more sleep, just general ""take care of yourself"" shit, but that's not the root of my problem. I'm a chubby guy, but me being a little disgruntled with my weight doesn't keep me awake at night. Maybe therapy would be a good idea, but I don't think I'm emotionally capable of going through with it. I don't think I could open up to a random stranger in real life if I can't talk about these problems with the people I *know* love me and would be there for me. Never mind the financial aspect of it.

This isn't who I wanted to be. I'm not proud of myself. I hate that. I hate myself for letting me be this way. I hate how low my self-esteem is. I hate how spineless I feel. I hate how little I weigh in my own eyes. I hate that I can't find what I'm supposed to be good at so that I *could* have something to be proud of. I hate that my life so far has just amounted to aimlessly meandering without any sort of progress towards achieving something. I'm scared that eventually this feeling is going to get to be too much and I really do step off that ledge one day. I don't want that. I want to read those books my favorite authors are in the middle of writing. I want to play with my dog more. I want to see my best friend get married. I want to keep living, but the crushing amount of hate and shame I feel hurts so much.",1
Fuck love and fuck life I don’t want to feel againI don’t know how to be alone. I just want someone to always be there. I want someone to love me even when I mess up. I want to feel totally at ease with someone. I know that will never happen. Our society is so fucked up you can’t get into a relationship without someone cheating. I don’t want to try anymore. I don’t want to feel this pain again and again. I don’t have normal emotions and I can’t take this bullshit. I just want to be enough but I never will. I just want to die and not deal with the pain and suffering. I don’t want to wait for it to get better. I just want to stop my mind and my hurt.,1

"I'm feeling suicidal but not because Im depressedAlright, so Im 20 and I'm in my third year of university.I battled depression for the first two years of  university to the point that I almost killed myself last year. For some reason, after that incident, I decided to turn my life around and change the things around me. I was suicidal for many reasons but it was mainly my poor grades and my lack of hope for the future. I really did turn myself around and vowed to never even think of suicide again.

But I find myself here again but this time for different reasons. Things aren't perfect but I have no reason to feel suicidal. I have friends (who I guess are close but I have major trust issues), my lovely parents, and a bright future (if I work hard this semester, I can go on exchange to Spain next semester amongst other things).
Like I said though, things aren't perfect and I guess Im tired of trying to pretend they are, to myself. Ive always tried to let things slide by and remain happy because I didnt want to get into depression.
Now I just see how meaningless life is and I have a long way to go to get to where I want and frankly Im just exhausted. Im privileged to have the things I do in life but I don't have it in me to continue to work hard and fight to get to where I want. Im not lazy. I will do what I have to do to get things done but I dont see the point in doing all these things when there is no meaning to any of this. 

Im not sure why Im here. Im really calm, not scared about this situation.",1

"Things were really bad. Things are only getting worse. Things can never get better.Hello. And Goodbye, I guess.

Things aren't good. Things haven't been good for a very long time. And now, they are getting worse. Far worse. I am running out of time. I am running out of everything.

I failed my post grad at university. Twice. I couldn't study. I had lost the motivation to do anything. I probably should have said something. But I didn't. I just sat at my desk for hours, with my books in front of me. Thinking about jumping out of my window.

Even so, I came close to passing the second time I took it. I was one exam away from passing. I could have asked my friend for help (he had been a lecturer in the subject previously), but I didn't. I was too embarrassed. Or something stupid.

Anyway. Now. Because I failed my post grad and know that my current job has no possible future, I lost all motivation to even move. I couldn't work at all. My arms felt like they were made of lead. I got into big trouble at work, had a nervous breakdown, spent some time in psychiatric hospital. Spent some more time off work. Trying out new medications with my psychiatrist. Got back to work. Thought things might be better. They aren't.

I think I am going to have to leave my job soon. Definitely. And I don't know what I am going to be able to do in the future. I can't see myself being able to do anything. I want to carry on, but I don't know how that could even be possible.

"What's the pointI'm feeling very worn out. I had to move back in with my mentally/emotionally abusive parents last year because me and my fiance broke up. We were together for 5 years so it's been really hard on me. Had to fit half a house worth of stuff into a very small bedroom. It feels so cramped and makes me anxious. 

I haven't lived here for 5 years so I don't know many people who live in this city anymore. Everyone I used to know moved away. All my friends I had before I moved back also stopped speaking to me even though I've tried to reach out to them. I think my ex told them lies about me, and I can't bring myself to tell them the truth about what happened because it's way too fucked up. There was only one old friend that I started talking to again and we started dating a few months ago, but I already feel like his feelings for me are fizzling out. It really sucks. I have nobody to talk to.

Also, finding a job with all the coronavirus stuff going on is impossible. I don't even have a car (it broke down and was so expensive to fix that I had to get rid of it) and I've got problems with my immune system. I don't think I should be getting a job until the number of cases start going down again. I signed up for online college classes though so I can hopefully finish the last few classes to get my degree. But I'm starting to feel like there's no point. I'm almost 30 and my life looks so bleak when I think about the future. My parents make me feel like a burden and sometimes I feel like they're right. I don't feel like I have anything to contribute to society or anyone else's life. I feel like I'm just going to end up homeless again",1

"My wife just told me she cheated on me with my only other friend in this countryWell, not my only other friend, but the only one that's close enough that I would have turned to them at a time like this.  Now I kind of want to be around someone but the only 2 people I was counting on for support are the problem.

This is what I would call a stupid reason for contemplating killing myself.  But, I don't know.  I have a history.

Before I met my wife I couldn't imagine a future for myself.  I was a college dropout who had never had a steady job, a serious relationship or much of a social network to support me at all really.  The plan was ""figure something out for myself, I guess, or give up some day.""  This sounds like a sign of depression but I never saw a doctor about it.

Well anyway, things took an upturn about 8 years ago when I met her.  2 years ago we finally got married.  She got a job halfway around the world and I followed her here.  Even if I haven't been a perfect proud productive little member of society, at least I've been doing all right and keeping my chin up.

But now I'm thinking back to my little plan for dealing with a life that never seems to go down the right track.  It never left the back of my mind, I suppose.  I've always loved to quit.  If the going gets tough, I give up and go home.  This is the ultimate way to quit and for some reason the logic has always appealed to me.

Anyway, I don't know why I'm having such a strong reaction, but since she told me I've started to think about how to die.  I'm really thinking about it a lot.  I haven't consciously decided that I ""want to"", but I can tell that the subconscious part of my mind that makes decisions is divided.  Part of me wants to quit, part of me doesn't.

I think the main reason against is that I can easily imagine it killing my mother, too.  She's getting older now, her health isn't perfect, and she just loves me so much.  My parents wanted children but had to try for 10 years just to get one, me, and when I think about it, it would be unconscionable to throw that away.  I'm so pragmatic that I know *I* can't regret it, after I cease to exist, but right now just the thought of hurting my mom like that is what's kept me from doing anything.  I guess I need to think about her more, to keep the downside in my mind.

Well, I don't know, reddit.  I just wanted to tell somebody what I'm feeling right now.  I'm really pretty shocked, and I'm surprised at myself for so seriously entertaining this notion so quickly.  I think I'm pulling back from it but... I wanted to put some words down and make that idea concrete.  Thanks.  I think it helps.  I hope it helps.

"dont mind me, just gotta vent for a minute even though im a happily quarantined introvert attending online school, 2020 has still been rough, as it has for everyone. i seriously think this year is cursed. ive been insecure, lonely, depressed, and constantly anxious for years now, although its all been going quickly downhill recently. despite how happy i was to be free from attending irl school, i found myself missing the little social connection/affection that i was getting. that emptiness and longing has been growing faster and faster; i cant stop thinking about having a loving relationship, and every time it pops in my head, it eventually leads to thoughts of inadequacy because i feel like i'll never have one. i cant stop judging myself for how fucking ugly i am - i wish i could just accept it and move on, but its always in the back of my mind gnawing at me. i dont have any real-life friends, ive been fighting with my parents more than ever, and the only person i really trust anymore is my half sister (my only sibling) - but shes 25 and always busy with her own life, so i hardly ever get to speak to her. on top of all this, my mom is a therapist, so i'd feel really guilty asking to see a different one - if i asked, it would probably just lead to a painstaking argument that would leave me in tears again. my mind is in a near-constant state of turmoil, and the only way to cope is to jump from obsession to obsession in order to run away from my thoughts. i have no skills/talents and nothing seems to make me as happy as it used to. i cant stop noticing flaws with myself, i always blame myself for everything, and i cant get rid of this \*\*stupid fucking desire for cuddles.\*\* ive always had trouble expressing myself/articulating my thoughts (which i believe to be a symptom of high-functioning autism, but my mom refuses to get me tested), so i have trouble opening up to people even when i want to. as a result of all of this, i feel like im caving in on myself, and i just dont know how much longer i can last.

Three more years of high school is daunting. What's after that... is terrifying. I swear, the only thing keeping me from completely losing my shit is music and reddit.

I finally found the woman of my dreams but I have spent the whole relationship fucking it up. It seems I continually disappoint her and fuck it up. She doesn't deserve any of the pain I've caused and I can't help but feel like I've ruined what I have with her no matter how many times she tells me I haven't. I stopped taking my Prozac and other mood stabilizers about a week ago because I feel like at the very least I deserve to suffer for having hurt her. Now she's deploying and we aren't on a solid foundation. She's the only person I regularly talk to and confide in. I can't talk to anyone about these thoughts.  I told my girlfriend and I feel like all I've done is worry her. I started smoking and drinking again. The only reason I can figure that I haven't shot myself or crashed into a wall yet is because I don't want to hurt my girlfriend. I've seriously contemplated self harm lately but I haven't done anything because I'm too afraid. I've been sleeping so much since she deployed and I have no motivation to leave the bed. I feel like I would've been better off if I just fucking ended it a few years ago like I thought I would when I had no obligations. Fuck man.",1
"I'm 28 years old.I'm 28 years old and I feel like I'm in my 70s. Nothing brings me joy anymore. Everyday feels the same. It almost feel as if I am drowning. It's hard to get out of bed or give a shit really. I have felt this way since I was 16. People always said it would get better. Well I don't believe it anymore. My 20s have have almost past me and I have nothing to show for it. There is no light at the end of this tunnel. There is no pot of gold at the end of this rainbow. All I feel is apathy anymore. I tried everything, from volunteering at a homeless shelter and a free health care clinic. I  eat super healthy and work out 6 days a week. And I still feel so weak and tired. I even tried to find comfort in alcohol.  Nothing makes me feel better. I tried taking medication and I tried talking to my friends and family. I also talked to doctor about it and they all said just give it time and it will get better. How long must I wait. Everyday feels like a chore. I'm sick of jumping through hoops. I don't really even know why I am writing this. I just finished packing all my things into boxes. I cleaned out my refrigerator and vacuumed and mopped my house. I changed the oil in my car and filled it up full of gas. I withdrew most of the money from my bank accounts and put the money in an envelope on my kitchen table. It should be enough to cover my death and more.  I have written  notes for my mother and all of my friends telling them how very sorry I am, telling them what I love about them and thanking them for all they have done for me. They are the only reason I lasted this long. I bought a .308 Winchester. I cleaned it four or five times now. Its the first gun I have ever owned and its the first time in a long time where I feel free. It's finally over. I wish you all the best.",1

"I popped a bunch of anti-depressants and anxiety pills on an impulse.I was on an anxiety related medication a year ago and had some pills leftover after the medication course was over - which I didn't think much about. Last few months, I have kept cycling between really low and high moods. And I had a low mood for the past few days; but today the dam just broke. In between the incessant crying, I don't know what came over me; I just popped in all the pills that were leftover. Thankfully, there were only about 7-8 left. That is still about 4 times the recommended dosage, but apart from some drowsiness, I am mostly fine.

The problem is that at the time when I was gulping them down I was fervently looking for more. Had there been more I may have, may have taken all of them.

I am not suicidal. At least I don't think I am. This was more of an impulse coming from a really low point. I just can't seem to catch a break and now to add to it I am terrified that slowly and steadily the last 'barriers' that I have against getting serious suicidal thoughts are slowly getting eroded.

And that is just making things worse. I have tried exercising regularly, maintaining good diet and the lot. But I keep falling back in the ditch.",1
"Got benefit sanctioned now Im suicidal.Today I got a letter from the DWP stating that I'm being sanctioned by £10.40 a day for 68 days for being sacked from my last job, I only get £317 a month from Universal Credit (dont get the housing they've fucked it up and im waiting for it) so they've left me penniless and de facto homeless. I went down to the job centre in a fit of rage and cried and told them whats happened even told them I feel suicidal they told me they cant help, so went to citizens advice and they said to come back tomorrow. 

It wouldn't matter if I got the full UC (housing and JSA) because it'll still leave me unable to pay the rent, food or anything. So I then spent a few hours walking around town thinking about throwing myself from the bridge. 

I cant even convey my feelings, a mix between blind rage and feeling suicidal. ",1

"The past me, is going to kill the present me.I am 26 years old. Been going to college for 6 years like a dumb ass and still hasn't graduated. I recently had to move out of my dad's house because we got into a fist fight.  I am going to college and can't pay for tuition because my credit fucking sucks from all the shit spending I've been doing when I was younger. The young me took out student loans and blew it, and now that I am actually trying hard to study, I can't get any more loans because I met the aggregate limits. My mom's credit is too shit to cosign me for a private loan. I'm living on my own and I had a pretty girl friend. It's sad because when we first got together I was such a put together person. But now I moved out and I couldn't manage my finances and so I am 2 pay day loans in the gutter and with no money for rent. I'm so fucked, and I don't know what to do. I feel like just quitting with life. I know it's the cowards way out, but I'd rather do that then be homeless. I just don't know what to do. I hate my younger self for being such a stupid shit head and fucking over my present self. My family would always call me smart and that would make me feel accomplished, when in reality I am worthless. It took me so long to develop any work ethic, and at 26, I have no idea how to live on my own and afford it. The only thing holding me back right now is knowing how devastated my mom will be. My cousin killed her self not long ago. I feel like my family is just fucked to begin with. I've been on craigslist trying to pay someone to cosign for my student loan for weeks.  Which is a ridiculous notion, and I've been somehow hoping that someone would actually do it. But now I've come too late, and everything is toppling beneath me. I've been in so many interviews but can't get a job because of my shit credit. I've never been so depressed and suicidal before. I feel like I want out.",1

"This was supposed to be the best week of my lifeIt took me up until my senior year of high school to find people I would call friends, with the exception of two I knew growing up who would later ditch and leave me to join their own. Problem is, they live 2,300 miles away from me after my parents decided to move accross the country right after I graduated. 

For the past two years, the entirety of my social life was me and them playing a game called Dota 2 online and over Skype. But it has always been our dream to go to the 18.1 million dollar championships of this game in Seattle, and here we are. My friends drove all of the way from those island to Utah and then to Seattle to see me and to witnesses this amazing experience.

This is supposed to be the happiest week of my life, but all that's on my mind is killing myself when I get home.

Up until my senior year, everyone that I have ever met wanted nothing more than to hate me and tear me to pieces. I've had soup dumped on me, pictures taken just to laugh at my reaction,and shoved so hard I broke a bathroom stall.

And then the only two friends I had joined the bullies and left me alone.

One of the only things that kept me going was some kind of superiority complex. For some reason, I convinced myself to be at least smarter than everyone else that hurt me. I taught myself that I at least had a higher intelligence than average.

But this trip has proven to be the complete opposite.

I've spent the 2,600 hours over the past 3 years learning to play this game, the only social thing I had, with the intention of being the best I can . although we started at the same level, my friends are now a lot better than me, and they have played even less time than myself. I don't know anything and my opinions are always invalid. And coming here to Seattle just enforced that.

Being told I'm wrong is something I have gotten used too. I have decided ADHD and often my behavior is complete trash and annoying, and everyone around me, especially my immediate family, is constantly micromanaging my actions and telling me I'm annoying.

Every single person I have ever met has found me annoying. I'm not smart, I'm constantly being told everything I say or do is wrong, every opinion I have is invalid. 

I'm supposed to be registered for college classes by the next week, but I have desire to be there. All I've ever done is fail at everything I've ever tried to do. If I were to disappear, the only people that would even bother to go to my funeral would be my immediate family, and staying alive for people that constantly call me a failure is no longer worth it.

The only purpose or ability I have to offer humanity is to be a punching bag for them to let out their stress. Now, I do care for my Rhode island friends, but after we all go home I will be left alone again with nothing. No real connections.

I have nothing to offer, I have no drive to do anything, all inhave ever done was fail at the things I've tried my hardest to succeed in
 Everytime I speak my mouth I am met with negative feedback or with disagreement.

The only thing I have ever done was be wrong and fail. There is nobody or reason for me to stay alive for. I am the essence of defeat.

They say things got better after college, that was most xefinently a lie.",1

"Dealing with a chronic mystery condition. Why should I keep living?It started a year ago. I just woke up one day and, out of nowhere, suddenly it was like I was living in a fog. Every movement makes me dizzy, I'm detached from reality, and I can't focus or concentrate. I can't enjoy TV/movies or even play video games anymore because my eyes are constantly so disoriented that they don't ""know"" where to look. Everything is just a huge mess when motion gets involved.

I've seen every doctor under the sun. No one knows what's wrong with me. A few people online report similar symptoms, but none of them have found a cause or a way to relieve symptoms. I had to quit my job because just moving my eyes is enough to make me dizzy.

Plus, I feel fucking stupid now. That's not an exaggeration. I can barely think. It's referred to as ""brain fog"", and it's the final nail in the coffin for me. My only achievements as a kid were related to doing well in math and school. Now, I have fucking nothing.

I feel bad knowing that there are people who have it even worse than me, but I don't think I could go on living in their shoes either. The only times I feel even remotely happy (or even content) are when I can distract myself and forget about my life situation. That's not a sustainable long-term strategy. I'm an unemployed single guy in my late 20's, and I just can't go anywhere anymore. In one year, I went from someone with a promising life ahead of them to a husk of a man with nothing to look forward to. I just don't want to live anymore.",1

"I Can't Do This AnymoreIn 2 hours the deadline for submitting outstanding work on my course will pass, meaning I automatically fail 3/4 of all the credits I've done this year. My tutors have been very nice and one of the two pieces of work was due in about a month and a half ago but had an indefinite extension, but that can't go beyond 5 (GMT) here. So I've totally fucked up.

I've been depressed since I was 8 and it's got worse every year - before I could at least do academics, now I just can't anymore. I ended up in hospital for a suicide attempt last year. I hate my life so much, and I know that only i can change it but I'm too fucking weak/lazy/whatever to do anything. I do a useless degree anyway and have no prospects of employment once I leave, I'm 22 and never had a job for fucks sake... and now I've fucked up my education, so I'm about £23000 in debt for that plus about 3/4 of that given by my parents that I've wasted.

Add to that a big problem with computer use (that I'm ashamed to admit because what kind of fucking loser ends up like that instead of something actually addictive like alcohol or drugs?) and I don't know where I am. It would be one thing if it was just me but I'm disappointing a lot of people including my family and boyfriend (who I love but we never have sex because I just don't ever feel like it)

Thing is I know I'm actually not much of a suicide risk because a) I wouldn't want to do that to my family and friends and b) I don't have the guts to go through with it.

I've had plenty of support from family, friends, whatever. I'm on medicine, doesn't seem to do jack. I'm to blame, end of.",1

"Realisation / time to vanishWe're to start.

I've got bipolar and whilst writing this I'm on a serious down so it's a struggle to even attempt to express my feelings. But I feel kinds hopeless. I believe I'm only truly happy when I've got something to look forward too. That thing was university. This has suddenly been snatched from me as I was not invited to join back the second year of my college course. Reasoning behind this is because I work 50 odd miles away from the college and unlike students there I'm older ( 21 ) so have responsibilities and such. Luckily I've been offered a position at another college to do their send year. This means though my job I currently have wouldn't be possible to do anymore as its too much of a journey. 

So that part is really getting me down and also I've had a really rough time whilst being at my parents house. My mother despises me and my farther left before I was born and refuses to acknowledge my existence. Meaning the 2 people who are meant to be there for me don't give a shit. It sucks because me and my mum used to be inseparable and she was like my best friend. Now she won't even answer me when I talk to her just ignores me. So leaves me feeling alone. I also have a girl I've been seeing but because of my bipolar it makes not so hard to even show emotion towards her. I don't miss her. And that worries me but I just don't feel it. I wouldn't be upset if she left me but I don't want her too. I just want to feel normal and not 
A emotionless twat.

"I just want to destroy my whole bodyMy mind is fucking racing, is it fucked that I can self harm in front of my family with them just thinking I’m retarded? Like earlier I hit myself and my mother just said that I was acting like an “Autistic kid”. Oh who cares, I just want to punch my face until it swells and bruises, punch my stomach until I vomit, cut my face, legs, and arms until my whole body turns into a scar, i’m already a scar on others, why would they care? It’s the norm for them, it’s the norm for me, I might as well turn my whole body into a fucking human bruise to show how others feel about me, they never gave a shit, they never tried, they are so unwilling to help that they take “cat scratches” as perfectly horizontal cuts. Why bother, why bother caring if I cut my face, why bother being afraid if my mother sees my whole face fucking swollen, bleeding and fucking purple.

No one cares, people online have shown more care for me then my family and friends ever have, even people online pretend they care, so why should I care. I’m expected to be a fucking perfect jewel in everyone else’s mind yet I can’t be that, I can’t, I just can’t do anything in order to make anyone happy, all I’ll be useful for in the future is contributing to fucking taxes for a corrupt fucking government. I don’t want to live for others, I don’t want to be alive, I didn’t ask for any of this shit in my life, I HAVE NO CONTROL EVER. My thigh is fucked from cuts, inscribing words as if I’m my own fucking stone block, just writing shit all over my self. I have no worth to anyone, no worth to anything except for maybe some fucking microbes living on my body.

All I am and will ever be is a burden to everyone, just a number, just another fucking robot working for 60+ years of my life away and pretending I’m happy. My looks are just fucked, my fucking ugly teeth, slightly ginger hair, a disgusting fat fucking body, my whole body is just like a 5 year old drew me on a canvas, and unfortunately came alive from that drawing.

I have tried suicide over 5 times just this year, each time it fails it just drives me further to suicide, I hope death comes to me soon, I hope I live in pain for my last hours just fucking feeling all the pain I deserve, all of the words, pain, and everything else that I deserve. I deserve nothing but death, that’s all that I’ll ever deserve. I am a burden to everyone and deserve NOTHING, absolutely nothing. I’m a horrible person for trying to open up to people about how I feel, trying to bring my problems on other people, how fucked am I, how stupid am I. I hope soon comes the day I get to say goodbye.",1

"My suicide note. I think I’ll be going tonight.I have come to the realization that I as a human am unproductive. A waste of space. A drain on society and those around me. I can’t keep a job, I am fat, I am moody, I am rude, I am distant and cold, and crazy. I didn’t ever really plan to go like this, but I have struggled to much and everyone else around me struggles constantly and I just can’t watch everything around me fall apart, I can’t watch me fall apart again and I’m not strong enough to pick up the pieces this time. I see no worth in living this life. I try to remind myself of all the people who love me and all the wonderful things I have. Yet somehow that just comes back to me realizing I am consistently failing those people. The voices in my head that naw at me everyday I had managed to keep at bay, but not today. They are relentless in their attempts to bombard me with truths I’ve come accustomed to. You’re worthless they say, you’re fat and disgusting they say, you’re wasting your life, your ugly, your stupid, you’ll never make it, everyone thinks your awkward, or ugly, or weird or stupid. Your nothing. Kill yourself they say, down the pills, all of them, and go to sleep they say. You’re a nightmare no one else will wake up from unless you go to sleep they say. Worthless worthless worthless they scream! It is constant and consistent and after a while when you’re mind is telling you something you sorta have to believe it, it becomes reality and it is my reality. My reality is that I am fat, I am poor, I am sick, I am worthless. I fail at everything I try. I have no dreams, ambition, or goals. I am so sick all the time. My body hurts, my brain hurts, my heart hurts. I’ve been nothing for a long while and now I can stop wasting peoples time and space and energy. I know this is going to affect a few people. Some family, some friends, my love, my animals. However if I didn’t truly  believe all of your lives would be better without me I wouldn’t be doing this. I promise all of you your life will be better. You may be sad, or angry at first, but soon you’ll be better. You won’t have a needy, crazy, lazy, human in your life. I won’t be there to bring you down, to worry about .
I love so many people and that is the worst part of this. Leaving all of you knowing I won’t ever feel Corey’s kiss again, or feel my puppy give me kisses, or my kitty rub her head on my hand. I won’t feel my moms hug, or hear the passion in her voice about her next new project. I won’t see my baby brothers grow into the amazing men I know they will be. I won’t see my grandparents and their unwavering ability to love and care no matter the screw ups. I’ll never hear my sisters harsh but truthful advice, formulated by long almost poetic rants. I won’t feel the summer sun on my skin. I won’t get to listen or watch thunderstorms, I won’t feel grass under my feet, or taste chocolate. I’ll miss life but I can’t live this one anymore for all the good there is equally if not more bad. I sit and I think not only about my failings and my mistakes, but about the worlds. The greed it infuriates me. I want to cry thinking about children starving while an American family gorges themselves at the golden coral. I hate thinking about the piles of dogs and cats being over bred and under looked. I hate thinking about woman being raped, not just in America, but young children in other countries and woman mutilation. I hate to think about people of color facing horrible tribulations every day. I hate thinking about the fact that our president, the man who is the face of my people, is a sexist, racist, ignorant, uniformed human. I hate this world it’s disgusting and our planet is dieing, and no one anywhere cares because we as a people are to oppressed to care, we can’t fight the wrongs of the world when we’re fighting to keep ourselves above water everyday.  I’m tired of trying and failing, I’m tired of crying, I’m tired of this body and this mind, I’m just so fucking tired and all I wanna do is go to sleep. So that’s what I’m going to do, I’m going to go sleep, and dream of a better world, a better life, a better me. I love you. Goodnight.",1

Other than that I for sure know my cause of death will be by suicide and I’ve honestly known that to be a fact since I was about 10. I know for sure I will be dead by the time I’m 60 without any doubt in my mind. It’s not a matter of if for me it’s a matter of when.",1

"Life of a socially inept personI've suffered from depression for 4 years now and at this point it's not suffering anymore but it's my way of life. My life has been molded by depression and it has left me with an empty feeling inside and it has given me a lot of time to reflect upon my purpose here in life. The main cause of my depression comes from my social ineptitude and time spent alone. I consider myself reasonably ""normal"" when alone, but can never seem to express myself the way I want to when in public. I'm extremly self conscious and sensitive. After years of never having opened myself up to anyone my sensitivity has ramped up to the extreme point where any form of conflict whether it be someone being mildy upset with me or angry at me makes me tear up and blush. I barely even speak to my parents anymore. I don't have any friends   
and my life is exponentially growing ever more painful and thoughts of suicide that has lingered around me for years seem more and more tempting. Life doesn't matter anyway right? Eventually the human race will go extinct and all of humanities accomplishment will have been for nothing. The only thing keeping  me alive at this point is hope that something will make life worth living.",1
"""so many good people in this world die, why don't you die?""
Those words came from my very own mother, I hear them more often than you'd think. I don't know when or how, but I just want to die at this point. I've dealt with depression and suicidal thoughts for years. They are scars in my head that I know will never heal, and hearing these words from the person who dumped me in this hellhole frustrates me due to the fact that suicide is much easier said than done. It frustrates me so much so that I feel like grabbing a knife and stab myself to death, that's no exaggeration. She's chosen to yell, mistreat, and abuse me rather than seeking a different way of dealing with trouble or some small mistakes. And that has made me so violent. This world only cripples over time, there's nothing worth living for.",1

"Need some advice on what to watch forI hope this is the right place to post this, if not, please let me know of a better subreddit.

My girlfriend, whom I love more than I can describe, is bipolar. This means that, statistically, she is 10 to 20 times more likely to attempt suicide than the average person. Every so often this little fact creeps into my mind and breaks my heart. Before she was diagnosed (and before I knew her), she had attempted once, a story I don't know the details to other than the *big* scar on her wrist, and she just recently hit a depressive phase where she didn't get out of bed for two weeks. She's told me that during that time, she had made all the preparations necessary, including what dress she would be wearing, and what music would be playing. (This is breaking my heart just to write this.)

Now, all I know about the method she was going to use was that is was supposed to be clean and painless. I made her promise that she would get rid of everything when I started dating her, and according to her, she has. However, I don't know whether she could (or would) acquire more and attempt again. I know what to look for in her moods and actions, but I need to be able to keep an eye out for the physical means. 

If it's best not to have a thread full of ""easy and painless"" methods, then you can PM me. Also, if the mods want any verification that this isn't just for my own use, please feel free to PM me as well.

Thanks Reddit.

"I’m feeling scared. I think I’m getting too close to doing something stupid.I’m scared. I have been struggling so much this past year.

And tonight I finally brought inside Incase I wanted to go through with anything. I’m in so much mental pain right now I don’t know how to feel better. 
I graduated college and things were looking up. I was with my girlfriend of 16 year. We’re both 29. We had been together since we were kids. She left me and said, “At least now I don’t have to pretend to love you anymore.” She took everything with her. But left me a fucking TV. 
I have yet to get into the career I chose to be trained in. So I feel like such a failure. And now all I can think is, “this is why she left me. And she was right.”
My friends don’t talk to me anymore or have moved away. 
I’ve seen so many people die. And can tell it must have messed with me. Even my therapist was surprised. According with her violence has just been normalized to me.
After months of therapy, I realized I was in an abusive relationship. Some of the emotional abuse was me. Name calling when I was upset. She would be physically and emotionally abusive. She Broke my fingers, gave me black eyes, threw objects at me. And belittled how long it took me to become a good student. 
I have been chronically sick most of my life. Cluster headaches and migraines. And now it looks like there’s something wrong with my liver. 
I want things to get better. I’ve tried improving myself. I’ve lost around 70 pounds since a year ago. I’ve tried making new friends. I’ve tried dating apps. I’ve been learning music theory and piano. Everything seems so hopeless. I’m feeling so lonely. I have reached out to some people. But it seems like they don’t want to deal with me.

"Hello. My name is Christian, and I am going to kill myself this year. (long text)I came from a broken family. Mom was a manipulative, narcissistic, quick to anger caricature of a mother. She was the kind of mother who'd tell you she regrets having you to your face. The kind of mother who say hateful things about your father and in the same breath tell you you reminded her of him.

My father, while the better parent by far, was too much like me to provide any real help. My mother was right. We're practically the same person. Same mannerisms, same interests, we even look the same.

What happens when these two people breed at 19 and 20 respectively? With no money or any idea how to raise a child? You get me. A severally depressed, anxiety ridden, developmentally stunted, jackass with no morsel of self esteem, and a lifetime of negative experiences to wish for an early grave.

I've been depressed for a majority of my life. In fact, my teens were completely robbed from me as a result of it. My father kicked me out of the house at 18 for being disrespectful and I can't say it was unjustified. I was an angry little shit. but I was also very sad. Well, due to the stress of my life at the time, I developed TMJ. And then tinnitus. The biggest devil in my life.

Music has been one of 2 things I've ever loved. I make it in fact. and it's all I've ever really cared about. Now with Tinnitus, I can't enjoy music. not mine. not any. My passion has been stolen from, and I can't do anything about it. Having Tinnitus for this long apparently cannot be cured. And with this, my life cannot be saved.

If you check my post history you can see my battle with my mental health and happiness. And I'm here to say I've lost the battle. I've got a plan. right down to the exact spot I'm going to shoot myself at. Right down to that very shotgun model. right down to the alcohol I'll inebriate myself with as I wait for the train.

Like man. Just say you don't want to listen to me vent anymore. Just say I am a waste of your ""good vibes"". You of all people should know I've been dealing with shit since I was young.

"I can't keep fighting anymore...It's official, I'm fully broken. My life has just been one failure after another, a constant downward spiral to the point that I am now, my absolute lowest.

I guess I might as well tell my story, one last time, for anyone that cares. I doubt anyone will, but fuck it, I feel like I need to leave something behind.

I started cutting when I was sixteen, usually in response to ""feminine"" thoughts I would have that I knew were wrong, were not thoughts a boy was supposed to be having. Ever since I can remember I've always wished I was born a girl and I always knew that was wrong, that that could never be and I was just being a foolish child dreaming about it day in and day out.

Fast forward to me being 19. I joined the Army because I had too, my father kicked me out of his house because I had no job and I wasn't in school, thus, useless. I did ok, for a while, after AIT (job training) I went to Korea and spent a year there. I drank to excess every single night and would stand in front of the mirror punching myself as hard as I could because I hated what I saw, still do.

After I turned 21 in Korea I started buying liquor and beer on base and feeding it to my underage friends. We had parties every night in someones room, sometimes mine, sometimes someone else's. Well, on this particular night it was my buddies. There was this girl   that always blacked out, like every single night. One of us would take her back to her room and return to continue drinking, this night that responsibility fell to me. I got her out and down the hallway before realizing I had no idea where she lived. Rather than going back and asking, I took her to my room, I figured I'd let her seep it off and she'd go home in the morning.

After letting her puke a few times, holding her hair back during, she climbed into my bed. At this point I can only remember feelings, not thoughts, but yeah. I asked her lightly if she wanted to do it, she was too far gone to give me a proper response (just a grunt/moan) so I proceeded anyway. 

The only reason I didn't go completely through with it and rape her that night was that she had a tampon in and for some reason that stopped me, snapped a little sense back into me and I got up and left. I didn't go home that night, or for the next two nights. I slept in my buddies room too scared to reenter my own room. 

The rest of my tour in Korea I spent drinking all the time and self harming consistently.

After Korea I was sent to Ft. Bragg, NC. I was already out of shape because of almost never needing to work out in Korea (we worked 12 hour shifts 3 days on 3 days off and our sgt's basically didn't bother trying to make us do pt until it was obvious we were all failing the test) so I was immediately gotten on for that. Day in and day out I was told how useless, fat and pathetic I was. With that record already playing on repeat inside my own brain, it only got reinforced over and over again until, finally, I'd had enough. We were supposed to be deploying to Afghanistan and I was not getting any better. I decided that for the safety and betterment of the people in my unit I would kill myself now before we deployed so they didn't have to deal with the shit hole that is me.

I took a fuck ton of ibuprofen and musscle relaxers... and failed. I forgot to lock my door as I was doing it during lunch (it's when I finally broke) and my Sgt. came in to see me lying on my bed with empty pill bottles everywhere. Instead of sending me to the hospital though, he made me get up and start doing pushups all the way to the company because I was late coming back from lunch. I didn't make it more than a quarter mile at BEST before the pills took over and I collapsed, puking and shaking. Only then did they finally call an ambulance.

I was given a full honorable discharge, I had no mental illness diagnosis before I had entered the military so the doctors put it all on the Army. I didn't care, I was just biding my time until I could do it again.

Just a few months later, about a month after I got out of the Army, I tried again, and failed again. It seems I have a knack for getting caught.

Now here I sit, 27 almost 28, a trans woman ugly as anything you can imagine, overweight, scar ridden and diagnosed with Bipolar 2 and BPD. I can't hold down a job, I can't even get out of bed for most of this past week because I have zero energy. I don't care anymore and I'm ready to leave this world behind, make it a better place in my absence.

I've done 9 inpatient hospitalizations, 1 intensive outpatient program and 1 residential program, all of which helped in the moment but not much longer than that. I cannot stand the idea of going back to the hospital for a 10th fucking time so I'm not going to. I've done a no call no show on my job the last two days so clearly I don't have a job anymore, I'm living in an apartment under my fathers dollar and he is not one to let me forget that. 

Every friend I have reached out to has ignored me so fuck it, they don't care and I don't care.

I haven't been diagnosed with depression but very deep in my heart I take pity on everything I do, every mistake, every action, thinking it wasn't good enough, and that's killing me. I haven't done my bed in like two weeks, and although that may sound ridiculous, that's the sign for me that something isn't right.

"InevitablilitiesI'm on mobile, so I can't format this. It's all I have, I'm sorry.
I almost called a suicide hotline tonight. I talked myself out of it. Why should I waste some poor persons time to prolong the inevitable? That is, assuming, that they care. They don't. They don't know me, or understand me. I don't even understand me. They would do nothing for me, and we would both end that call knowing someone will die tonight. 

For the last several months, I've been unemployed. No one will call back. I'm not being pressured to get a job, but the point still stands. I'm useless. Every single week day, I'm by myself all day long. Everyone else in my house has school or work. I have no one. Even if someone was home with me, it's not like they want me around.

Every single day I think about killing myself. It would be so easy to just end it. Sure, maybe my friends would pretend to be upset for a week or so, maybe my parents would pretend they gave a damn for a couple of months. Even people who don't talk to me would come swooping into the tragedy, bolstering about how ""close"" we were and how much they quote unquote, cared and missed me. That's the role people who don't care about you play.

There's no point in me sticking around. My own best friends can't stand me most of the time. I push everyone I care about away, and justify it by saying they don't care about me. Granted, most of them don't. The ones who do care about me, I push away because it'll be easier to kill myself when they hate me. 

I don't know why I'm typing this or debating posting it. There's no real help for me, and if I decide to kill myself tonight there's nothing anyone on this subreddit can say that will stop me. Maybe I just want attention. Who fucking knows.",1

"At the bottom of the barrel emotionally and academically, have no where to turnI'm not sure if I'm earnestly suicidal, to be honest. But I don't see any future for myself but continued disappointment and failure. I've never made myself or anyone else proud. I've thought of the where, when, and how 2-3 times and even started writing a letter once, but I held out for the hope that I would do well on my tests.

Well, I didn't. This quarter in my college I tried much harder than last quarter, wherein I barely tried and mostly played games. I got lucky and still passed all my classes (passed math by 1.6% woohoo). Still had a gpa of 2.3 though.

So I set into this quarter deciding to try much harder. I still forgot a lot of the homeworks, and had a lot of problems with anxiety during and before tests, but I made sure to actually study for tests. I usually would do every practice midterm my professor published before a test, in order to practice. I still didn't as well as I would have liked. I just made constant small mistakes that added up.

Same thing happens in physics. Art History was cramming and memorization and I always managed to procrastinate that until the last second. Don't know how, it always just slipped my mind (despite todoist and whiteboard lists trying to help). Still I was doing much better. Made it to all my quiz sections. Didn't miss a single lecture unless my anxiety-gut crippled me. My quiz and laboratory grades were 30-50% higher in all my classes. I've joined an engineering club and made enough of a mark to be offered a leadership position and a private research class with a professor next quarter. They don't really care about that, though.

It doesn't matter now though. I got my grades back, and despite doing nearly 20+ pages of math (+6 practice finals) and 3 and change practice tests for physics, I didn't get above average. I got 18% below in both classes, and now have a 2.2 in math and as-of-yet unseen grade in physics.  My parents wanted improvement this quarter. 0.2 improvement won't be enough. I doubt art history will be pretty either.

My anxiety has gotten worse. I had a full blown anxiety attack and pretty much cried myself to sleep before my physics and art history tests. At 6am. 2hrs before I had to wake up. Basic math was a struggle and nothing in my head was clicking. Art History final was similar. 

Night after I got back I couldn't fall alseep until 5am as well. Cried myself to sleep then too. Just feel hopeless and worthless. I've felt tired and my leg twitches have been worse and my whole body feels all tight (like when you're cold).

I was worried I might have ADHD. I meet all the inattentiveness sypmtoms and all the emotional symptoms, and I have anxiety issues. I brought that up with my Mom and she thinks I'm just being lazy and looking for an easy way out. I haven't talked to my Father, but he's even more against it. They don't want me speaking to a shrink. I don't feel its the easy way out. The medication terrifies me, but I feel its my only hope. I want to be able to work hard all the time, not just in the hours before tests. I just can't get motivated, and since my whole family is driven, they don't understand how I'm not motivated. And my aunts mental breakdown on Vyvanse isn't helping my case either. 

My campus doesn't do ADHD stuff either and even regular psychs have a 4week wait time.

I have no options. No escape. No future. My parents and family are dissappointed in my and I am a tremendous failure. I'll have no money for college or medication, so even less of a future. I don't see the point anymore. I don't think I really want to end it, but what else am I going to do? No one is listening to me. Everyone thinks I'm lazy, but laziness suggests happiness being this way. I'm not happy like this. I don't want to be lazy. I don't want to end it all, but what else is there left for me but a sad future as a college dropout working horrid jobs? I have never felt this hopeless and this worthless. I have a few days until I have to tell them grades, but I don't want to lie or make them wait. At the very least, they deserve the truth of my failure. I just can't listen to my father call me a huge disappointment again :c

I'm not gonna take my life soon. But its an option that has appeared in my head and I'm starting to see why",1

Anyway...

He's so amazing. I love him so much, our 4 year anniversary is coming up on February 14. I got him his gift and it's currently in transit. I just wanted to say he's literally the most amazing thing to ever happen to me, I wouldn't be the person I am today without him. I... live in an extremely toxic home, and I hate it, I'm not allowed to date but I don't care, I fell in love with someone, and we've been together almost 4 years now. He's so amazing...He's so kind, and charming, and passionate, and loving, and willing, and handsome and cute and literally any positive thing you can think of. He has no flaws. He's so perfect in my eyes. He's been there for me when literally no-one else has.  I couldn't be more thankful. I am so lucky, that everyday I get to call this wonderful human mine, and I get to call him cute everyday. Things have been hard with covid, we've been apart 315 days, which is, to most LDR's silly, but he's my only friend. I...am a pretty lonely person, but that's alright. I have about 2 other close friends and that's all I really need. He's literally my best friend. He's been with me through everything. Like I said, I have a toxic home-life, my father is a POS and my mother...she isn't much better. Before him, I knew there was something mentally wrong with me, and to this day my parents still don't really believe I have an anxiety disorder and I quite possibly could be depressed. (not being dramatic it's rough.) He is also my first, well everything just about. This is the first real-real relationship I've been in, he was my first kiss, my first slow-dance, my first everything. He's so timid and gentle and knows exactly how I'm feeling even if I don't tell him initially. He tells me he's proud of me, and the first time he told me that, I broke down into tears. No one has ever ever told me they were proud of me, he sees the smallest steps I take and he recognizing me for them. I've been working my hardest on not apologizing so often and getting a grasp on my anxiety. I know to some now, it's so silly to think that you're first relationship is the one you're gonna marry. But I so truly believe he'll be the one I marry, I want to get married to him, I want to have a life with him. These past 4 years, I haven't felt sad, like ""unneeded"" sad, of course I have days, but he's literally lit my life up. I wrote a poem about/for him last year and in the poem, I talk about how he re-lit my ""spark"". My spark is well myself, my personality, my happiness, my passions my all of it. I don't think I could ever begin to repay him. With everything he's done...I'm overjoyed. And I tell him all of this everyday and he takes it with such modesty, or ""I know I'm all these things, but so are you"" He knows me, he knows who I am, he's the first person to ever willfully get to know who I am, and to love every, single, inch of me, even the parts I can't love right now.

&amp;#x200B;

I think I'll stop there for now, I could novels upon novels about my love for him, but I think now is a good time to stop. I'm currently working on a song for him, It's been a really long writing process but I think it's coming along well. Anyway, thanks for reading that whole long winded thing, :)",0

\- they low-key hate me because i'm the odd one out

\- i feel like they're laughing about me because  our walls are so thin, i honestly feel like they can hear me breath talk and move. i feel like the commentate and everything i do or  listen to

\- i'm so confused why they could hate me like that 

\- they lie to me about this under-breath shit ,... someone tell me if i'm wrong, because i'm the target. i feel like i'm being lied too 

\- i used to be a mad stoner (not legal where i'm from) just came clean almost a year ago .. but on and off have some. stopped because of the paranoia ... honestly started to feel like they were commentating on me or mocking me or trying to drive me crazy.  it got so bad i even thought my . family installed a mic/camera in my room. 

\-  i got put on serotonin because they said i was unhappy  and so paras do you blame me? 

\- i used to have a  huge  group of friends and then last year we started growing as individuals, but i'm going down hill as fuck unhappy with my body, face, family, and mind-state. i sound  so crazy i know  i just wanna know if  anyone else there  has had this before or could just help ?

"[Vent] Don't read, I'm crazy.Love: I feel stupid because I think I am in love with a stranger on the Internet via a game. That person is of my age, but I have just heard their voice. It is just their voice and their personality that attracts me, not in a sexual way, but in an 'affective' way. I often fall in love and I each time I do, I feel like it is a sin, a crime, to fall in love. I almost always think of that person and I am afraid something bad will happen to me from that person. I try to retain myself from feeling in love, but I can't help it.
Trolls: Trolls on the Internet damage me so much. I feel stupid for thinking of them. Maybe it is because I am too kind and I never wanted to hurt anyone innocent. I rethink and rethink and rethink of the negative comments, posts, that my gender is wrong/bad, that my sexual orientation is wrong/bad and I should kill myself, that the amount of friends I have determine how retarded I am, WHY DO I HAVE TO SUFFER ALL OF THIS SHIT? HUH? I even feel like people around me hate me and are disgusted by my behavior. I am constantly scared I seem creepy or too close to people, but these are not my intentions.
Success: I feel like I WILL  NEVER SUCCEED AT SCHOOL. If a video of 3 million views says I am not intelligent and I believe it because when I try to get comfort to people irl they don't oppose to that video which means I am officially dumb stupid and a slug, that means I will not have a great job, I will choose the wrong abusive partner in life, I will get in traps, I... I used to be the greatest in all my classes... but not anymore... not anymore... these girls, who hate me, they are doing better than me, but I was better than them. They want me to suffer and they like to see me sad/mad. Why?
Judging people: I calculate my movements so that I wouldn't seem weird. I want to read books on body language to know how to not be creepy or seem stupid. I want to be intelligent... I was accepted in a great school, but, like people say irl and on the Internet, school is not about intelligence, no, it is totally not because of my intelligence that I was accepted, it was because of my 'efforts' and determination... I used to have determination... I don't have that hope anymore... it's gone. And these girls are sure happy to know I am desperate. AAAAAAAAHHHH, WHERE DID MY INTELLIGENCE GO?!?!L!?!!!

"I don't think it will ever end.For context:  I am a 30 year old male.  Growing up, I was always the life of the party.  Sure, I drank more than my fair share, but i was never angry or abusive.  Everyone loved me.  I can't think of a day that i spent alone.  2 years ago, i decided to take my ex back.  We had broken up 4 years prior for numerous reasons - i told myself i had forgiven them.  We caught up, talked, apologised and a couple of months later they moved interstate and moved into my apartment with me.  A couple of weeks later, the fighting started.  The fights were over drugs (them, not me) and not working.  Getting tired of being the only one trying in the relationship, i cheated.  Honestly i know it wasnt my smartest move...but i did it.  I kept it a secret.  I found out my SO had cheated on me and i berated them and yelled at them, knowing full well that i had done the same.  One night whilst fighting, my SO punched me in the head.  In that exact moment i became withdrawn, reclusive, introverted.  I stopped talking to friends and family.  I stopped leaving the house.  A month later, i admitted that i had cheated.  My SO went through my computer, including social media, my phone, everything. They texted everyone and posted all over the internet what i had done.  This has been ongoing for the last 18 months now.  They still do drugs (pot and meth) and everyday i am yelled at screamed at.  I only go to work.  I don't leave the house for any other reason.  I have tried to.  But i came home to holes in the walls.  My things smashed.  When we argue they take my bank cards, my public transport cards.  They have thrown out my passport and ID.  I am the only one who works.  Everything is in my name.  I can't leave.  I can't throw them out on the street.  I can't be that person.  Not after what i did in the beginning.  I can't leave - they will destroy my life.  The only thing i can think of is just... going.  I don't want to, but i don't see any other way.",1

"Been thinking about ending it since I was 16... 12 years of this shitI have no purpose. I have no passion. I exist and that existence inconveniences the people around me more often than not. I wish I hadn't been born. My parents lost their first baby to a heart defect, their relationship was crumbling, and I was a last-ditch effort to stay together. My mother moved several states away to test my love for her (I refused to leave my friends and my school behind). That was years ago. She rarely talks to me now and only when she has problems. My dad decided his girlfriend was more important so he kicked me out two weeks before I was supposed to leave for college. He stopped helping me with rent afterward. Jobs didn't pay enough. My grandmother stepped in but suddenly stopped because I didn't have time to visit between school and work so I didn't deserve the money. I was nearly homeless and am now in debt. I met someone and we moved in together, but he treated me poorly so I broke up with him. We're stuck living together. He spent 3 days crying on me, telling me he loved me and would get therapy to resolve his issues (he was abused as a child). He promised he'd treat me better. It got worse. Tonight he waited until I was leaving for work to start an argument. He had his friends on PS4 chat so they could listen to me break down and finally yell at him about how he was making me feel. He said he doesn't care about me anymore and that he'd like it if I never spoke to him again.

&amp;nbsp;

I was late to work for the first time ever. I'm angry that my perfect record is fucked now. My boss is already upset because I've missed the deadline for a mural I was painting while also doing my other job at the desk. I haven't heard my dad's voice in a year. When I was about to be homeless, he told me to live in my car. I can't because I live in Texas, have no AC, and sleep during the day (I work nights). I wanted to take my life at work so I called my mom instead. She happened to be awake, which is rare. I thought it was fate. I'm not supposed to die. But then I told her how I was feeling and she said... that there was nothing she could do. She said she needed to go to sleep because she has work in the morning. Does she not realize that she may not have a daughter in the morning? I don't want to do that to her but I'm so tired of everything. I've waited 6 years for things to get better. I've worked hard to make opportunities for myself but nothing ever comes of it. I'm passed over for promotions because I'm too crucial where I'm at. I'm stressed at work, I'm stressed driving my old car with its check-engine light on, I'm stressed at home where I can't cook because his dishes have sat there for 5 months. There's mold everywhere. He's so loud I can hear him through my earplugs when I'm trying to sleep at 2pm.

&amp;nbsp;

What's the point of all this? Try to make some money, it's still not enough. Get things done at work and someone's been there longer than you. The company sets us up for failure half the time. I don't want to work anywhere else... or anywhere at all. I don't enjoy anything. I don't enjoy anyone's company. I don't trust men anymore when they say they love me because it's never enough or they're lying. So I'll be poor and miserable... I'll be alone... That's it. That's my life. That's all I'll ever get. Debt. Betrayal. Abuse. Depression.

&amp;nbsp;

What's the fucking point. Why do I owe it to anyone to keep living like this. Why don't I get to decide if my existence is worth continuing. Fuck. I can't check myself into the hospital because then everyone will suddenly be interested and I'll fall for it and then I'll be hurt all over again when they stop caring. And it'll go on my medical record, I'll miss work and maybe lose my job because I'm unstable and I live in an at-will state.",1

"Why bother...This will be the 2nd time I've brought up my thoughts of suicide anonymously... First time was on Omegle probably a week ago, now I'm posting here.

I've had the urge to kill myself for much longer, obviously, and it's just been this past week where it's almost getting too much to handle. Normally, I can just tell myself no, I'm not going to do it, but it's getting harder and harder.

My depression has been getting worse too. Lately I've been sleeping for more than 12 hours a day and eating maybe once a day. I've had problems caring about handing in projects for my classes, or even going to classes. Two weeks ago I just stayed home for the week. I told everyone that I was sick, but I guess that wasn't really a lie. 

My struggle with depression probably started in grade 8 or 9. The friends I was hanging out with before all went to gangs and were just general shitheads. I realized that, and moved away from them. But I didn't really make friends again until I was in grade 12 (for the 2nd time). After our first semester in university though, I started drifting away from them. Right now I can only call 4 people friends. Although, I never see them. I never see anyone. Almost every waking moment I have I spend it in front of the computer, because there's nothing else to do.

I've tried talking to therapists, I've tried taking antidepressants (Wellbutrin), and I've tried smoking pot hoping it would just make me happy. It didn't, nothing really has.

I'm not sure what I'm doing telling everyone here this, but I figure I'll try anything right now.",1

"it feels horrible to feel totally alone even with access to the internetI'm posting here because I really don't want to end up back in the hospital a 4th time. I'm having issues coping with being alone. I read the forums for a ton of websites. I frequently lurk all over the internet and dispite all the conversations taking place and all the people I see, I have never posted.

I feel like I don't know how to talk to anybody on the internet and I don't know how to make new friends. On some occasions I've met a girl and hit it off with her, but it fails because of the same reasons... I push people away and I have an inability to become friends with her friends. I don't know how to talk to someone without freezing up. It makes getting a job terrible.

I've been to psychiatrists a lot in my life and I've worked out a lot of the issues I have but it never helped my issues with motivation and my ability to talk to others. It's actually so bad that I haven't already ended it solely because I can't get up the nerve to ask someone for help with jumping my car battery so I can drive it to a safe location.

I lost most of the friends I made in high school and the very few I still talk to on occasion are all in different cities away from me. I just don't know what to do. I can't up and move because I don't have the money for it. I have such bad work history that it's really hard to get interviews now. I have no skills and I have no idea what I want to do with my life. I know it's pointless to think about, but there are countless things I wish I could take back.

how do I talk to people and make friends? Everybody I meet just thinks I'm weird. I'm not good looking, I'm not witty, I'm just a gamer/anime nerd. I've always been polite and nice and I'm really accepting I just... never hit it off with anybody

i don't want to inconvience anybody so im worried that if i just go through with my plan without moving my car then i'll hurt someone innocent but this isnt about that i just

i just want help

i wanted to start programming but i dont know where to start i used to have dreams of designing videogames and i look at things like minecraft and wish that i could just make a living doing what i enjoy like him (I bet a lot of people wish that but can't, now that i think about it)

"Who can help?I've been in a very low place since July. Something happened in my life that caused me to really shrink away from everything. I didn't want to go back to school. I wanted to take a year to sort out my thoughts, but the parents put the pressure on. They have a stiff-upper lip sort of keep calm and carry on attitude and didn't understand that I really wasn't up for it. I went back and end up spending almost all of my time alone and failed all but two classes. Drank alone to escape feeling of isolation. 

Came home begged parents to help me if I transfer. Nope, they'll only help if I stay where I am. So I go back. I do well for a little bit. Fall into old habits. Drive back from friends house; get DUI. Knocked around and taken to prison, locked in a cell. Call parents, bailed out a day later.  Luck out and accepted on probationary program. Then I just quit. Stopped going to class. Stopped leaving apartment. It's been three weeks, another failed semester. Have seen professional ""help"". Have taken an SSRI. Parents are all about seeking ""help"". I have thousands in fines, if I don't pay them I go back to jail. No job, no options. 

I love my parents (Dad/Step-mom) and they've been there for me, but I feel like they're unable to understand. Always throwing money at a problem. Leaves a residue of guilt and debt. Have Mom too, mentally unstable, difficult to visit. Makes me sad to see her. She's no longer the person that raised me. 

Always told to get help. Feels like nobody can help.

edit: and student loans for a degree I'll never have...",1
"I don't know whether I'm gonna survive the summer. I love him so much but he hates me. I can't live.I've posted this in r/depression, but I usually get few to no responses anywhere, so I'll try my luck here.

I just feel overcome with sadness because of something I have no control over.

I just take pills and blindly hope I'll somehow get better. I never really was in a relationship with the guy I loved. We met online, chatted for hours every day for a period of 3 moths, and met up once I'd declared my feelings for him. We kissed for ages, and it was my first, but by no means his. He seemed so sweet then, so lovely. All of a sudden, he just changed. He told me that we definitely wouldn't date, and hinted that if I died, he wouldn't care. Then, he started seeing someone else. I had a relapse of suicidality, and he was the only one I could talk to about it, because I didn't have much of a social life offline. As I said in my post, I angered him. But after Christmas, he seemed to be over it and seemed to forgive me.

For the next three months, it was a whirlwind of thinking he cared, to him telling me awful things, such as ""you're immature"" and that I had a nebula of negatativity around me. Eventually, my father threatened me with all types of shit if I didn't stop talking to the boy, so we went NC for a month. Tried to contact him again, and he wasn't having it. He told me to piss off and threatened to send pictures of him and his girlfriend if I didn't leave him alone. I blocked him then, because I was too hurt to even think.

The funny thing was though, I called him up the next day and he seemed fine. He said that he'd rethink our friendship once I was better. But a few weeks later, when I tried to talk, he just didn't seem willing to. He said some even worse things, called me a professional victim, and said I was leeching off the 0 fucks he gave about me in the hopes that he'd stay in my life. He cut me off after that... I know that I pestered him a little, as I messeged him a lot after and tried to get him to Skype. He did eventually, but he hung up on me mid sentence. He had the audacity to text me last week, to mention how much fun he was having out camping, which I mentioned. I plummeted that week and nearly ended up overdosing on Tuesday.

I love him so much and I have so much care to offer him even though he's happy with someone else, but he hates me and doesn't care about me at all. I am nothing.

We can't afford therapy anymore. We have free healthcare here in the UK, but our mental health service for young people is trash. At one point, we were paying £800 for a session with a psychiatrist, which equates to over a thousand dollars. It was simply too much, as I've been having therapy for the past 3 months and it's yet to help.

I genuinely feel as though I may attempt suicide soon. It's no longer an ideation, it's a fear.

"I’m not living for myself.Honestly I’m just going to be blunt and honest about this instead of sugarcoating it and making it look like a beautiful piece of writing. I want to end my life, it’s all I think about and I’m only here because people need me. If I didn’t have my mom, my friends and the rest if my immediate family I would have ended it a long time ago. I’m nothing but a dropout, minimum wager who lies with his parents at age 20 and has has a life full of failures and pathetic choices. I’ve done shitty things I can’t live with, my life is nothing besides my mediocre minimum wage job, I don’t have a future and I’ll never be capable when it comes to living a normal life. I care too much about people’s sanity and that’s why I haven’t killed myself yet. I hear the screams of my family if they were to find me dead, I see what it would look like and what would happen afterwards. I fantasize about this shit and it’s never going to stop. Even if I could rid myself of my disabilities, make life a great thing and never have another bad thing happen to me ever again I would still say yes to suicide and I would say yes over and over and over again with pride. I can’t live this pathetic life anymore and I’m slowly starting to care less about how others would feel if I was gone. Everyday I see images of my death, I hear my own voice in my head telling me to do it, etc. I’m not glorifying suicide and I don’t want others to do so. I want this for myself and it’s been a long time coming. All I can do is sit here and endure my shitty life, let my past traumatize me and wait until I have no more people depending on me. The day when there’s no one else in my life will be the day I’ll be gone.",1

"If I can get better, you can too......I suffered from depression since I was in single digits, probably around 8 or 9. When I was 11 I tried to kill myself for the first time, ended up in hospital. From then until November last year I attempted suicide four times. My body is covered in scars. 
Mid last year I stupidly decided to buy some heroin online and subsequently became an addict. Yes it made me feel 'better' but I stopped eating, stopped going to work, basically stopped doing anything except shooting up and nodding out. It all came to a head on the 9th November last year when I attempted suicide for the last time. I filmed a video and sent it to my ex-boyfriend at 4am, then took a wide variety of prescription and illegal drugs, shot up the last of my heroin and laid down in my bed to die. 
Luckily, my ex had got up early that day for work, had uncharacteristically read his emails and drove like a madman the 20km to my house and saved my life. I don't remember much of the following couple of days but I woke up in hospital. After that I promised to stop using but I lied. My ex took me back and I pretended to be happy but really I was still planning to kill myself, and I was definite about finishing the job properly this time. 
But then I got committed and finally got the help I had needed for almost 20 years - ECT (electroconvulsive therapy). I've had 12 sessions of ECT and I can honestly say I no longer want to die. I can honestly say I am happy and hopeful for the future. I haven't even had ANY therapy, group or singular - I'll be starting singular therapy next week and will be having maintenance ECT starting in the new year. I have been suicidal for almost 20 years and now, finally, that feeling has gone. 
Last week was the year anniversary of my last attempt. I cannot recommend ECT enough, it has completely changed my life.",1

She says this in such a happy joking tone that I just want to strangle her (not literally of course). I've asked her if she actually means this and wanted to talk and this bitch started laughing her head saying ""I'm so suicidal haha"". My friends don't know about me so she probably didn't even care.

"I want to hang myself and I can't fight the urges anymore (33m ) I'm approaching end of my associates degree in CS. I have an exam tomorrow and all can think about (for the last year or so) is where to hang myself. I am doing this degree for my mother at this point. She's all I have (stepdad is nice,  but not as close). No friends, no relationship, nothing. I have a music hobby I love but that doesn't earn money nor do I want to earn from it. I took a drive after studying to clear my head and I ran into at least five terrible selfish drivers and one crazy pedestrian (I live on Cape Cod people here make my issues worse, insane drunks, junkies and completely oblivious morons everywhere).  I can't stand other people, humans are fucking terrible. Including me. I would never hurt anyone, just myself, to clarify.  And I know there are some good people out there. Almost everytime I leave this house I lose more faith in humanity. From arrogant young adults at the school (some elitest professors as well) to terrible behavior I witness from adults outside school (drinking and driving, throwing trash out the window and just plain trashy behavior in general). I was molested as a child by my half brother for years and abandoned my drunk dad at 13. Ive been depressed my entire life. Bullied at jobs to add to my trauma (I look like a celebrity according to them and a thousand other people who have said something, the insults were relentless, so fucking sick of it) This whole getting a CS degree was a way for me to get out of working shit trade labor jobs, and make use out of my love for computers, but I can barely focus anymore. I get decent grades but if this depression keeps growing past the level it's at, I will start failing. I have Calculus I coming up next week and I have to sit in 3 hour night classes with about 13 other people. Fuck my life. I don't want to interact with anyone. I hate being alive I just want to sleep forever. I will probably hang myself with a proper noose in the woods during hunting season, so hunters can find me( someone experienced with death and not my parents or some kids). Easy clean up, with a note that says burn me or bury me cheap if possible ( at least I can give mother Earth some contribution with my decomposition ). I know this will kill my mother, but I'm already dead anyways. I can't take it anymore this world has been trashed by awful people. I know there are good people out there, I know there's a lot, but it just feels like there are far more stupid selfish hateful people out there than good. It's all I seem to encounter.

We met through strange circumstances, but what connected us was that we both had mental illnesses that made suicide a deep issue. But she, she was so much stronger than me. While I flailed and cried and begged to just end it, she was fierce and strong and witty and tough. She was loud, so very loud, and had so much energy. When she walked in the room, you took notice. When she talked, you shut up. When she laughed, it echoed off the walls. She was the embodiment of getting better.

And two days ago she attempted suicide. Yesterday she died.

I'm not suicidal. But I'm lost, and afraid, and hurting. If this woman, this woman who stood up to her illness and told it where to go and what to do when it got there, if she couldn't resist the pain in the end ... how could I ever hope to?

"For attentionThis isn't a throwaway, which is weird. Maybe I'm just trying to prove to myself that yes, I *really do* want to go.

I've attempted before, but I really wasn't emotionally ready at the time. I think I am now, I think I've accepted everything.

I don't even know why I'm here typing this out. Maybe it's because these are thoughts I've never really been able to put into words before. 

Either way, onto the title I guess. I've never understood people who claim people commit suicide for the attention. That argument couldn't really make less sense. They're dead, they don't know they're receiving attention. Same idea with the people who say your family/friends will miss you. Like okay obviously that's not good, but once again, I'll be dead. It'll be literally impossible for me to care about it.

"Might do it tonight I don’t know what to doIt’s a complicated story but my boyfriend and I are in a weird place for the past couple hours and he’s been helping me through my shit but I keep fucking up no matter how much he’s trying to reassure me and now he’s just frustrated and won’t talk to me and doesn’t want anything to do with me right now it seems like, just closing the door to go to bed like I’m not right there, so basically I can’t go in the bedroom to sleep so I’m just alone and I have severe depression and ptsd and I’m in a really tough place in life but I’m in therapy and on medications. I’m still suicidal, for weeks I’ve been writing my suicide thoughts and notes to my mom, idk how she will get it but I’m having a full blown panic attack right now and I can’t see any option besides taking all my pills, I don’t know what to do, I hate doing this to the people I love but the mental illness is winning.

"I thought this was over...I suffered with depression since I was 13. At the beginning of this year, things started to get better. I was so happy and barely ever depressed. Right before that happened though, I was at my worst. I thought about suicide every day, and cut myself often. Quite a few times I could have ended everything but I always found something to make me decide not to. 

In the last month I've been wanting to cut again. Then this whole week I felt mildly suicidal. I thought it would pass but it's just getting worse. Last night I had a dream that I was going to kill myself, and now today I am at my lowest point this year. 

I feel so worthless because I am still living with my mother and only had one job in my entire life that lasted 2 weeks before I had a nervous breakdown, sliced my arm up and had to quit. I have no motivation to do anything even though I want to have a normal life. The only person that can fix this mess is me but I can't even force myself to try getting a job. I have no motivation at all. I don't see anything in my future except disappointment and uselessness. ",1

"aspergers + a shit timewell i’m young. i’m only a young child almost in high school. i have a whole life ahead of me. i struggle with aspergers and that just is really fucking annoying. it’s hard for me to make and keep friends. i can’t communicate how i properly feel to people so i feel very isolated around the thousands of students i know. 

basically in mind right now is this:
everyone loves me, but nobody likes me. 

i’m known as the “funny and smart” kid at my school. i won some stupid math contest and now everyone has high expectations of me. i feel like a tool for people to come for me for help. and because i’m so lonely i give in for any chance for a friendship. so they treat me nice. i haven’t told anyone about my aspergers which is really fucking stupid on my part but it’s okay for me. i only have 2 real friends. everyone likes me for my humor and brain but they couldn’t care less if i die the next day. 

and on top of this shit my girlfriend 2 months just broke up with me yesterday so i just felt like shit. as soon as i properly caught feelings she left. as for my only 2 friends, one of them has divorced parents and they’re both fucking shit people. i can’t get in contact of him outside of school. and my other one i try my hardest to talk to about my gf sadness.

i haven’t told anyone about me cutting myself and crying hysterically in my room. wearing my hoodie i used to give to my girlfriend so it smells like her, listening to sad music. contemplating about how deep to cut. i’m living the life. 

school is shit. after failing again again to my family and peers high expectations isn’t helping me either. my bad habits of obsession and the same schedule don’t help me. they only thing going well for me right now is video games. because that is my life at the moment. i don’t ever study and score high 80s and my family is mad at me because i don’t fucking care about my grades. they know and i know i can better in school but i don’t give two shits. they want me to get into good habits before high school but i feel so unmotivated to do anything. 

i don’t want people to think i want attention because i really don’t. i just want out of the hell that is my thoughts. i’ve thought about telling others because of my social skills i think they’ll misjudge my intentions. i don’t want to life but i’m scared to die. i’m scared of the endless uncontrollable subconscious. 

especially my family because they’re religious. oh fuck. 

i just have a lot of shit i wanted to get off my chest and rant about.",1

"Closer than I've ever been before.I am a monumental fuck up. From age 16 until 26 I was a drug addict. I pushed any friend that tried to help me or wanted to keep me grounded in reality away and embraced the ones who facilitated me getting high. Also during this period of time, from about 19-25 I found myself taking care of my ailing mother and complete ignoring myself (other than to get my fix, of course). COPD and lung cancer ravaged her for a long time, and I would sit high as a kite and do whatever I could for her because there was no one else to help. In my mind I thought ""when her suffering ends, maybe mine will too."" And I really believed this to some degree.

When she finally passed I remained addicted, depressed (even more so as one of my best friends died during this time) and isolated for about one more year, maybe a year and a half. Then I got extremely sick and was so miserable that I just decided to give everything up while I was sick. And it somehow it worked for me. I've been clean and sober from opiates, opiate substitutes, cocaine, crack, cigarettes, marijuana, and anything else that I found myself abusing for five years now (in December).

Which is good and all, but now I do not know what to do with myself and a hopeless feeling like one I've never felt before is slowly crushing me. I haven't been officially employed for more than a decade. I did not go to college. I want to go, but I have no idea where to start and have no one to talk about this with and feel like even if I did I would just breakdown.

I look at my peers and everyone is happy with a family and a career and then here I am, with nothing to show but the damage I've done to my body with my horrible decisions. I truly feel like maybe it would be best if I just ""disappeared"". Just went out one night to some remote area and blew my brains out. I've had this thought before, but as I keep wasting time I just feel like it's a reasonable solution.",1

"I am worthlessEach day I think about death. I think about how death might be painless and quick. I think about how if I were to die tomorrow, I could count all the people who would be at my funeral on one hand. I think about my dad a lot too. I remember the day he died like it was yesterday. I still regret not fixing our relationship. I regret not spending more time with him. He was alone when he died. He lay in his death bed, in my old bedroom. He would need help getting dressed and taking care of him. The cancer in his lungs had spread to his brain by this point. There was nothing the doctors could do. They found it when it was too late. He was too old and frail to be put on chemo. He may have had a few more years left had my mom not convinced him. Why didn't we have a funeral for my dad? ""We can't afford it.""

I'm alone now, my mom isn't letting me stay with her. I don't want to anyways. I'm at my SO's mom's house. I'm such a fuckin loser. I feel like a burden. I'm never going to get a good paying job. Let alone go back to college. I'm not capable of doing anything. I sit inside and sleep or watch Hulu or spend all day on Reddit or playing videogames. I'm not even enjoying this shit. I just do it to waste time. I hope I'm running out of time. I can't kill myself but if I die another way, maybe people will be able to cope better. I guess that's why I keep burning bridges, so I don't have to burden anyone with my illness. Ya'know, depression. 

I just want to be given a different life. A better life. I can't do it myself. I'm losing strength to go on every single day. I could go on about every single detail of how my life is shit but I know nobody will even read this far so fuck it. I'm just going to try to job search again. I need a job for now.

"Attempted so many times and it doesn't seem like I have much time leftI've got my shitty backstory like everyone else. Most noteworthy is my abusive parents, who I cut contact with five years ago after a suicide attempt and psych ward stay. They were the most abusive they had ever been when they got the bill. I realized if I kept them in my life I wouldn't have a chance at being able to keep myself alive. I've had more suicide attempts than I can count, and two additional psych ward stays. After one of them my then-partner told me that they wish I hadn't called them after I had attempted suicide, when I was overdosed and blacked out, because it was mother's day and they had plans to video chat with their mom. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've also been raped twice, and my first partner when I was a teenager was abusive, but like whatever. Pointless to list all my traumas. Everyone has their traumas but not everyone keeps ending up in the situation I'm in now.

&amp;#x200B;

About two years ago I had my last real suicide attempt. I wanted to not just die, but erase any evidence that I had ever existed. I ripped up every journal, got rid of like 3/4 of my belongings, deleted every picture of myself, every social media profile. When the attempt failed I realized I didn't even have anyone I could talk to about it.

&amp;#x200B;

About a year and a half ago I decided to go on a diet (I've always been obese) and that immediately turned into an eating disorder. I was eating very very low calories for six months. I finally got down to the normal BMI range and now I'm obsessed with maintaining my weight, which is its own hell. I'm getting loose skin removal surgery in a couple weeks which is the only reason I haven't attempted suicide yet - can't fail and then be denied surgery because they realize how crazy I am. (But now I'm starting to think... ok... just don't fail, then.)

&amp;#x200B;

So there's all of that, I guess, but the worst part of it all is I don't have anyone in my life. No family for five years now. No partner for like two and a half. No close friends for about a year now, when my only close friend relapsed with her alcoholism and blocked me. Just people I see occasionally who I can't seem to click with in that way. I leave social situations feeling even more lonely than before. I cannot describe how crushing it is to feel so lonely so I won't even begin to try. I've tried meeting new people, getting out in social settings, spending more time with the people I do know, but I feel like I'm just incapable of connecting with people anymore. Ever since my ex had that reaction to my psych ward stay it feels impossible to connect with anybody.

&amp;#x200B;

Each suicide attempt I have gets more serious. I think at first they were more cry for help attempts, but I realized what a cry for help actually gets me: getting yelled at about how expensive it is to take care of me, or being made very acutely aware of what an inconvenience I am on others. The last one that I failed, where I tried to erase any evidence that I existed, would have been successful but the item I got was faulty (won't say what that item was at the risk of sharing tips with other suicidal people reading this). It's not like I even had anyone to cry to help \*to\* during my last suicide attempt, It was not a cry for help attempt, I was very set on dying. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not acutely suicidal right now but when I get hit by a suicidal feeling, it's frantic. I have a plan, and I have exactly what I need to carry out the plan. At this exact point in time it's only a gnawing feeling that I can put off. But depending on the day, it can feel like killing myself is urgent. It feels like I MUST die IMMEDIATELY. I think this is because I realized with all my failed attempts before that any hesitation in a suicide attempt leads to failure. If I put it off to the next day I might decide not to, if I talk to someone before I'll get distracted, if I talk to someone after they'll call 911, if I write a note then by the time I've finished writing it I might decide to just go to sleep, etc. I think I have learned that if I am ever going to kill myself I'll only accomplish it by acting on impulse, and so now when I feel suicidal, it's what I'm singularly focused on. It's the only thing that exists in my brain. Fighting the urge can take so much mental effort that it's actually physically painful - like I'll get intense headaches, feel nauseous, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

So RIGHT NOW I am not at risk but I feel the impulse growing. I've gotten close to another attempt a couple times recently. I don't know that I'll be able to keep fighting it. My life has been awful and the only time I've been happy is when I was losing weight. There is nobody in my life who helps me feel better, or connected. There is nothing that brings me pleasure and I've tried many many many things. So now I'm posting here I guess, though I don't really know what kind of response I'm hoping for. I don't believe that anything will help. I've spent my whole life feeling this way and I know that if I put an incredible amount of work into my mental health I MAY feel SLIGHTLY better someday but it's so, so much work for so little payoff and I just don't have it in me to try anymore. I'm tired of working so hard only to be as miserable as before but now with stupid DBT skills or what the fuck ever. I've been going through the motions of life and ""recovery"" for so long and my life is not better for it. I don't want to keep subjecting myself to an existence that brings me deep loneliness and a complete lack of pleasure at BEST.",1

"Brought up in a sick world then I lost everything I had worked for when I became schizophrenicAt age six I was abused, then age 12 I was propositioned for sex, then at the same age I was asked to take my top off. At 14 I had a man of 26 interested in me that makes him a pedophile. Then at 17 I had sex with a man of 26 it was wrong and I feel suicidal about it. Then I was taken advantage off in my teen years, then at 22 I was sexually assaulted by a photographer. Not only did he assault me multiple times but he completely ruined my life. I did beautiful modelling work and never wanted to model again. When I was 18 I fell in love with with a man five years older than me and I had never experienced anything like it. We were madly in love and he taught me so much. We smoked weed together and i was already sick from a young age with borderline personality disorders but the weed made me think. It made me think about the world and that we live in a sick twisted world and everyone is sick and evil and I know that my experiences have shaped my beliefs about the world but I truly believe we are over run with evil. That we live on a hell planet. One day after all this and more had happened to me, I was smoking weed and I started hearing a voice, it told me to smoke the weed more and to watch the smoke in the chamber. I thought it was some kind d of spiritual awakening and my third eye had been opened and I was able to access the spiritual world. I still believe that to this day. That this world is not what we think and it could be a world that is so much more beautiful than we can imagine. I started to believe that there was a god and my voices were guiding to become more and more spiritually enlightened. They told me all kind of things. They took me on a journey. They told me to look up a documentary called war dance and I had never heard of it before and it's about the children in Uganda who were forced to murder their parents. I did everything the voice said, or voices, I couldn't tell if it was one or not, told me to do. They told me to get all my slutty underwear and put them all on then it told me that each one represented a sex slave and to throw them in the river. It told me more and it revealed to me what I was like and I don't think it thought I was a good person in a lot of ways. I was told what it was like like to be homeless, I was told to look at the stars and I saw the southern cross over and over again in the same spot. One day I came back to my boyfriend's place and there was always weed there and they told me to smoke the weed again and after that they told me to clean the place which was an absolute pig sty because I had been taken away to hospital, pinned down by 7 men over and over again while I was screaming and begging them not to drug me, that I didn't need drugs that I was on a spiritual awakening and I needed to see these voices or the teacher plant weed through. That the weed and my experiences was teaching me what kind of planet we are really living on and it's full of sickness. So the place was a mess and I cleaned it for hours. My boyfriend was always working and never took care of the home like I did. The voices were helping me they were waking my mind up like ayahausca does. One day the voices told me to open up my gates and let my husky off the lead the voices talked about freedom and that my husky belonged to the universe not me. They told me to follow her into the streets and told me to say come and she came back to me, when she came back to me I was so thankful that she had but then the voices told me to let her go again they were teaching how to train her. I'm a dog trainer by trade and she was already well trained and she loved me dearly. My husky had come from a couple who owned her and I had been training her. I would walk her three times a week and I would take her into the Australian Bush and let her run off lead for hours we walked and ran for hours free in nature like she should be. Like all animals deserve to be. She would follow me everywhere then I would drop her home. One night I was sitting in my garage with my boyfriend, as we live in a small garage where my boyfriend build the bed so it was on the ceiling so we had more space as he is very intelligent, and here was Harley at my door. She had escaped from her owners house and had come to find me so we spent an hour with her before returning her home. After a week or so I got a call from her owners and they said we want you to have Harley because she sits at the gate and howls all night for you. So we took her and she became my dog. She was under socialsed as a puppy and I made her into my little dog training side kick. We went everywhere together I even stopped seeing my friends and my boyfriend and my dog became my life. She helped me train other dogs and came on all the dog walks I did with me. She was my angel and I was doing angel work. I was helping people and she was helping me. I was setting these animals free and giving them a better life and they loved me like I loved them. So I set Harley free like the voices told me to and I got upset because the voices started telling me to walk to the city barefoot to prove my love to my love like the spiritual girl I was but somebody called the pound and I was crying on the floor because I didn't want to go to the city barefoot and they came and took my dog away and took me into hospital. There were signs during my spiritual trip... Like numbers, the voices led me to a house number 69 and they had been telling me to do 69 with my partner as it's equal and beautiful . And we can both get high naturally off oral sex because he used to do it to me all the time and make my mind run wild. The hyper priming that went on in my brain while I was getting oral sex was incredible. I can't think of another sign ATM. Anyway they took my dog away and put her in the pound they said they were going to kill her because she killed a cat but in hospital I prayed for days and for hours and hours on my knees praying to God because the voices told me to and my dad manage to get her sent to a large property in the northern territory to be a pest control dog because there are no dangerous dog laws in the northern territory. God answered my prayers. He saved her through my dad. When I was hearing voices my boyfriend had been ignoring me. It all started after I got back from visiting my mum in the UK I was a lonely person but I had my dog and my boyfriend. There is so much more to the story but I can't tell it all just yet I have thought about writing a book but I'm still dealing with everything that has happened to me. So I was all alone in hospital with the pound trying to kill my dog, my boyfriend who I loved so deeply that I would die for him was ignoring me because he just thought I was sick and couldn't cope with it plus I had set Harley free and he blamed me for losing her and was really really upset about everything because he loved me so deeply. I called him so much that the nurses called me stalkerish but they don't know true love like I do. That we are all slaves to money. Slaves on this planet like my boyfriend had to slave his life away to support us and I never got to see the love of my life in this one lifetime that I get on this planet. I was too Ill to work full-time and we were living in a garage so needed the money. Unless we became completely off the grid like we had planned on doing. It all fell apart I lost my dog, my job when they locked me away, my sanity when they injected me with drugs against my will. These drugs they give you are bad for your soul and your brain and made me feel incredibly ill and stiff and I couldn't shower properly I couldn't move, I couldn't talk properly and they never made the voice go away, the plant that was speaking to me or the God or whatever it was that was speaking to me no amount of drugs made it go away. Then I ran away to England I lost everything and I was so sad so so sad. And I ran to england. I got a flight assesment done and they said I was ok to travel after a month in hospital the voices stopped and they said I could fly to England. So I ran away from the drugs because my doctor said I had to be on the injection for a year but when I got to England, my mum, nan and grandad made me go to the doctor's and made me take my medication which did nothing but make me sick and the doctor said I was far too over medicated and took me off the injections. She still thinks I'm talking the pills but I'm not I haven't told anyone. They block dopamine receptors in your brain and make your brain produce more receptors to compensate when having an over reactive dopamine system is what they think causes schizophrenia in the first place. So the drugs just cause you to have an even more over reactive dopamine system. Not only this but the drugs reduce grey matter in your brain and cause Parkinson's like symptoms. I have not heard the voice again for the month that I have been here except for one hour one night. I have been having terrible nightmares. Nightmares where I have a hole in my stomach and my insides are falling out of it, I was looking at my heart pounding on the ground and my body was made of dead fish. It was strange I've never had a dream like it but I think dreams are spiritual things trying to tell us something. So after all this I have been having thoughts of throwing myself off the cliffs that I live on because I don't see myself ever being happy again. I lost the two loves of my life and I will never see my angel dog again. My spirit animal. And I just can't deal with that. It would probably be better if I my boyfriend hadn't left me before I came to England. The reason I left was because they were going to drug me for a year and my boyfriend broke up with me. I'm just so miserable I think the world is sick and evil and I keep having suicidal thoughts for good reason and I can't take drugs just to pretend that I don't feel this way when it's a completely valid way to feel. I want to die. Part of me doesn't but part of me does and im just so sad. I'm hurting so bad my heart aches and stomach aches and my head hurts and I cry and I stay strong and pretend I can cope but just sometimes I think of throwing myself of a cliff and how much better it would be. Can anyone help me I don't have any friends except my nans dogs and my best friend who is in Australia. I missed a couple of things that happened to me. When I was hearing voices I was told to run through my boyfriend's parents house naked which I did they had all godly ornaments all over the house and the voices told me that it wasn't God and they weren't really truly spiritual people. I ran through the house and into the drive way and they told me to dance in the street like I danced in the strip club and told me if I thought I was so beautiful why I couldn't I dance naked in the street. Another time was I followed my boyfriend to work on the train and the voices told me to do lots of things and I filled him an hour into the city he kept telling me to go home and I just kept following him listening to every little instruction they game me word for word. I went into the city and he went inside the building and I broke into his work and called his name but he ignored me as he was on a call. I left after that and went back to the train station and the voices told me to jump in front of a train but I didn't listen to they then told me tell out that I was being told by my voices to jump in front of a train and two people started following me and they called the police and I was taken to hospital again for more trauma. After I wrote this post I dreamt that I was in a tunnel behind a man on a scooter and I couldn't get past him o started to suffocate on the fumes and in the end I got out of the tunnel and could breathe.

"There's literally nothing I want to do more than kill myselfBut I can't. My family loves me, my friends love me. Fuck I even have a fucking dog who loves me. 

But I still don't want to be alive. I'm a 15 year old girl that has excessive body hair (and probably has PCOS), and I just can't fucking take it anymore. I'm so sick of the way i look. I'm so tired of being abnormal and disgusting. 

But my friends don't know. They know I had to go to the doctors to get hormones checked for the hair (which didn't help with anything), but they don't know how bad it is. They don't know that it's worse than every guy I've ever met, they don't know that I'm developing chest hair and stomach hair. I hide everything. I only wear hoodies and jeans. I never wear anything I like because of the hair. If they ever find out about how hairy I am, they wouldn't want to be friends with me anymore. 

My family knows about the hair, but they insist I'm fine. My mother insists that there's nothing wrong with me. It's like she doesn't have eyes. Can't she fucking see that my leg hair is worse than my own brother's? Or worse than my father's? 

&amp;#x200B;

If it weren't for my friends and family I'd take my father's gun and shoot myself. Killing myself would be the smart thing to do, it's not like things will get any better for me. I'm never gonna find a guy that's attracted to me, I'll lose all my friend and I'll lose my family. What the fuck is the point? I should just do it and get it over with.",1

"When I read posts of old people suffering, I lose the desire to reach that agePeople tell you that everything will get better and you’ll forget what you’re actually feeling, but what if not?

And, guess what? They are adults. They are 23 yo, they are 34 yo, people tell you that everything will get better, but there is people that just couldn’t make it to be happy since they were teenagers. 

I feel like I always will be sad. My only good period of life was 2009-2013, and I never knew true happiness. I feel so empty, I feel so bad, I’m afraid of the future, I’m afraid of people. I’m really anxious of everything, and everyone tells me that I’m a weird girl. 

I’m afraid to think that things will never get better.",1
"Coping after sexual abuse?Hey,

So, I've never really talked about this before, but here goes.


I was sexual abused from around 6-7ish? I'm not sure about the exact age, because a lot of my child hood has been blocked out. The abuse ended when I was around 11ish, which is probably when I started to realise that it was wrong.


He was a lot older than me. He was an adult, I was a child. He was a family friend.

At the time I didn't realise it was wrong. It's sick to even think it this way, but he made out we were boyfriend and girlfriend. He did this to another girl I know off, and she often referred to him as her boyfriend. I remember her being younger than me.

 I can kind of remember being confused and not really getting why we had to do these sexual things. I didn't like it and most of the times it hurt. The times he did take it too far, I would complain it would hurt and try to think about other things... Afterwards, he would tell me not to tell anyone and gave me sweets and play with me normally. It was like I went through with the abuse, just for the nice side of him afterwards.


I feel physically sick that I allowed this to happen. That I let him touch me and didn't tell anyone. I hate that I saw him as a boyfriend, it makes me feel so fucked up in the head. Like, why couldn't I have been the child to tell their mum what was happening? Why did I just ""go along"" with it?

So, we moved a way and I barely saw him again. He had a brief relationship with my mum (when I was about 14 or so) which made me feel I could never tell her. My mum absolutely adores me, and if she knew she had slept with someone who had molested her own child, I don't know how she'd react. She's suicidal, depressed and has Bi-polar... So growing up with a mother like that isn't exactly the best situation to be in.


I'm 26 now, and for the first time in my life I feel properly happy. I'm at university, I have an amazing girlfriend, loads of friends... But, my past is still there, ya'know? I've felt suicidal in the past, but I've always believed in my self to not let that chapter of my life win and wanted to push on and make something of myself.

I guess I'm just trying to say I'm worried. I haven't had any counselling for this or seen any help. I just want to try to ignore it and pretend it never happened, but I don't want to be one of those people that when their 40 odd, it all comes crashing back down on them. 


... I also find it really hard to talk about with people because I never physically stopped him. I feel like people will think I deserved it in some way because I didn't do more. I just feel so dirty and ashamed.

And recently, I've found out he has just had a daughter. This scares me to shit, the thought of him abusing another child. 

I just don't know what to do. I feel so useless atm, on the outside, I seem fine with loads of friends, my career/ect... But inside, I have all this welling up and I'm worried it won't ever go a way and I'll start getting suicidal thoughts again, or fucking up my life.


On top of that, I don't even know whether to go to the police. Would there be any point? Or do I just ignore it and carry on, because my life is ""okay"" now anyway?.. Sometimes I even pretend that it never happened, or it wasn't as bad... I'd even tell myself he never raped me, but I know he did...


I'd really appreciate some help with this guys. And telling my family is out of the question, I couldn't put my mother threw that.",1

Well, it turns out that everything that went wrong, went wrong. I made countless errors and coming out of the test and hearing the answers my friends got in the test, I feel like such a complete dumbass. I feel like I have been kicked in the balls and it really hurts.

It really put me in a really bad and unmotivated mood for the whole day. I this legit fear of being looked at as stupid when I know I am not. I work hard, I am committed and I invest a lot of my time and energy into my academics. It just really sucks that this type of thing can happen from time to time. And when it does, I begin to feel like I am less than or something. I have been told in the past by my sister that I should just calm down and stop overreacting. But setbacks like this sometimes leave so dejected that I just don't see the Pont of putting in the grind anymore. I have goals and I know I can achieve them. But I just sucks when you look so dumb sometimes.

"seeing flashes of self harm &amp; suicide when zoning outAnyone else have this happen? Lately, depression has a taken a new turn where I find myself just staring off at nothing - like someone would if they were in thought, but heavily glazed over. My contacts will usually go out of focus and fog up. Things almost don't feel real, like what you're seeing becomes a flattened image and your environment falls away.

Since that's been happening I'll sometimes get flashes of incredibly violent and detailed self harm. It's happening more frequently now that a new semester has started and it's starting to happen when I'm in class.

Just looking to hear if others have dealt with something similar?",1
"There is no way to fix myself.I don't even want to get better, and I have every reason to be happy and grateful. I have a loving family and group of friends. I'm always able to find money some way or another. I don't have any responsibilities and am free to go wherever I want and try anything I want.

But the one thing I want, and have wanted since I was about 9 was to just die. I don't really want to see tomorrow anymore. I go to sleep reluctantly and wakeup reluctantly.

I keep telling myself that ""Every day in every way is getting better and better,"" but I just don't believe it anymore. And I'm not even sure I ever really did.

I've already laid out how I see my life going:

I'm either gonna bounce between jobs and homes or I'll find some place and some line of work to settle down in. So far I've held little to no consistent interest in any place or occupation. I get bored pretty quick, so maybe I'll live on the road taking jobs as I go.
I hope that I'll keep my friends as lifelong friends, but I don't know if we'll always get along. Though I don't think I'll have too much trouble befriending others. Though I just can't really appreciate what my friends can give me. It doesn't feel like enough. Part of me says that's just me being ungrateful. The other half says that I just haven't found anyone on my wavelength.
I'm not going to have a family. I want so badly to have a woman whom I love and who loves me, but any time the opportunity comes, I'm not ready. Even in my fucking dreams. A beautiful girl will come into my life, and right as things get intimate, I can't do it. I can't kiss her. I can't let her tell me she loves me without breaking down and crying and running away. I want to be okay with a woman loving me. Or really anyone loving me. But when when I really think about my mother, my siblings and my friends, and how I know they all care about me, it just hurts. It doesn't feel good. I don't want them to love me. I don't love me. I wish I could love myself. I wish I could be happy that I am so loved by so many people. But it just hurts.

I expect that I'll be the first among my friends to die. I'm the oldest and the most suicidal. So if I don't kill myself, age, smoking and poor self-maintainance will. But I'd rather my friends die first. I don't want them to suffer my death, especially considering the likelihood that it will be self-inflicted.

And so I can't kill myself, that would be too harmful to them.

I don't want medication.

I don't want a psychologist.

I just want to stop existing.

Or at least to just vent on here.

If you actually love me or care about me, don't tell me that.",1
"Is there any reason to tell people I’m suicidal?I mean seriously what would it accomplish? I spend most of my days just wanting to be dead how could anyone actually help? My family?

My teachers? I’m already a failure, I can hardly face my teachers as it is why would I want them knowing I’m beyond help. What would anybody do? Call someone before I hurt myself?

"Compulsion is getting pretty persistentTrying to keep things short:

I guess I'm described as having dysthymia? Anyways, my emotional lows never get too low, and my highs are non existent... anything that gets me feeling remotely good is very transient. I think this is the way I naturally am, nothing is especially bad about my life (currently in college).

Honestly, I don't think I can get much more out of life, I have no passions or anything I want to pursue. I've some how managed As so far in my college career but things slipped a bit last semester. I don't care so much though. 

Life isn't bad but it doesn't feel worthwhile. I can't imagine anything that would make it so. Even the thought of having great wealth and travelling the world freely barely draws any sort of reaction out of me.

However, I do sort of want something: to buy a revolver and stick it in my mouth. I've researched prices and how to execute it to ensure death so I guess it's a pretty serious want. Sort of problematic because a part of me would also like to find something to live for. I guess there's still something in me that hopes but I'm fairly certain that I won't find whatever it is because it doesn't exist.

More frequently now I will get bouts of sadness that physically manifests itself as a shooting pain that originates on the left side of my chest and runs along my left shoulder. This is usually accompanied by a compulsion to kill myself.

I'm working out n' junk to try to lift myself out of funks. It helps but obviously it's not enough. I do have hobbies and stuff that I do with friends but meh. I went to go see a university therapist, she said that sessions might not be helpful to me because I don't really want to help myself. Which is true I think.

My name is Macy, im a transgender girl, and recently ive kinda fell into a fucked up place and i dont think i can get through this one. awhile back i ended up leaving my highschool because of my social anxiety, bullying, lack of motivation, and some other things. to appease my parents, i got enrolled in a few online classes because i still legally need to be in a ""school"" at the age of fifteen, but its basically dropped out at this point in my life. ive been able to keep my social life alive since that happens awhile back, but as with how the world works to a regular teenager, friends change, but this time with my old friends now gone, i really have no one anymore but a few people online and my bed, and the online friends arent really close to me either. ive had some issues in the past with drugs (coke, acid, weed, cigs, some others) that i had under control for the most part but recently ive felt the urge that it might be my only way to cope with this pain i feel in me, thats driving my sanity to the breaking point. i understand im young and i probably dont know what im talking about at this point in my life, but i know what i feel and it feels really terrible. my now ex-boyfriend hasnt spoken to me in over two weeks, which has really strained my mentality because he was all i had left in terms of close people, and i struggle with signs of some mental illnesses that make me really dependent and clingy (i'm not a fan of self diagnosing and my therapist said i can show signs but cant really have a disorder or etc until you're an adult, but he said he would agree i show signs of the things i believe i might have). ive found myself in a state of constant distraction to keep me from thinking of how alone and in pain i am, but it only eats at me more. i really dont know what to do anymore, ive tried hotlines in the past but they didnt help, and i keep getting the urge to die or do something drastic to make myself happy and then die in peace knowing i did what i wanted.

im sorry about the bad grammar im not really in the best of moods to proofread my rant about my depression.

"I'm ending it in less than a week.I want to end things Saturday night, once I've fulfilled all my social obligations for the weekend.

Feelings of loneliness and self-loathing have gotten to a really bad point and I feel like it's my only option. I've tried being a good person and to be kind to others, thinking it will make me feel better. Unfortunately it doesn't. No matter what I've done or who I help out, I will never see myself as good. I will never feel like I did good enough in school or in life. To put it simply, I absolutely hate myself and I think other people dislike me as well. 

The only thing I see in the cards for me is a future of scrambling to build my reputation in the corporate world, living alone in an apartment with very little sleep and company/friends. This idea scares the living shit out of me and I am less than 2 years away from this reality.

The only thing keeping me somewhat in check is going to the gym and video games, but those are giving back diminishing returns now. 

I'm going to write some letters to friends, family, etc to explain that it isn't their fault. Hopefully this won't be too big of a hassle for my roommates, I'm pretty replaceable.

I’ve been through some hard shit. My parents were abusive. My mom was a drug addicted narcissist and my dad was a drug addicted pedophile. I feel like a worthless human being. The post-abuse struggles and pain that I feel are inescapable. I’ve been in intensive therapy for 5 years and while there is some relief, the pain never really goes away. I’m tired of living this way. I just want to let go...but I have my daughter. She’s 7. If I left then she would have no one and I can’t do that to her. She is my only reason for living. She is enough to keep me holding on. I’m here for the long haul. I just wanted to vent. I hope some of you understand.",1

"Am I justified?Please don't read if you're dealing with suicidal thoughts, following are the thoughts that are making my brain hurt and I want to talk to someone to help me understand these things.

I've been slowly going downhill for the past 3 to 4 years, the knowledge that I'll crash eventually takes its toll especially if nothing I do seems to fix it. I've tried changing numerous times, often times I had to spend more energy just to fix my past mistakes than focusing on future or even present (without going into details, the nature of my issue is that I cannot move forward without a decent past).

So I'm here with time running out to fix all those things. My whole life hinges on just one outcome which I know is not looking good at the moment. What do I want from life? A job that gets me through life, and someone to hug, literally anyone. But it's not looking good in either of those cases because of the expected bad outcome I talked about. So this is something I worry about.

Then there is this internal battle inside me : I've been suicidal for years now, that I'm sure of. Sometimes I get afraid I'll do something which makes me go look for help, so thankfully I'm still capable of rational thinking even if only handful of times. At the same time I'm thinking : am I really depressed or is it that I'm just lazy and blaming it on depression? Is it worth it to yell for help, ask for someone's time when they could be helping someone more in need than me? Should I be shouting hey I'm depressed, help me when I'm only just lazy?

My failings are not only affecting me but also people around me in a negative way, each failure hurts more than the last one, I know killing oneself is selfish and says that you don't care how it affects people around you but I'm in a position where I'm going to be a huge pain for a long long time, why shouldn't I just give one big bad news with confirmation that this was my last mistake? I understand that suicide still scares people around me for life, but not doing that still means they remember your every mistake for life, it's like 1+5 is same as adding 6 ones, or is it? Hope you get what I mean.

So far, it's been a chore lifting one step after another, just going on with my life just because I want to see what tomorrow holds. If better days come I'll be crushed with happiness, if not then I'll just have to take another step, but that has become frustrating as of late. Seriously I get so overjoyed over small doses of good news. Whoever you are reading this, in whatever position, I wish you all the joys there are, because I cannot imagine putting even my enemies through this pain.

"RE: I can't do this anymoreMy last post here detailed some things that I was going through, and I wanted to touch up on that.

I'm actually feeling better with my psychologist. I feel like she realized she was pushing the electronics thing too hard, and i'm glad that I can finally open up to her about what i'm going through.

School, however, is a different story. I feel like I'm failing. My dad is pushing me harder than before, and I feel like I can't be happy anymore. I just wish that I could do the things I want to do while getting good grades, while having a good social life. I can't have all of them. I'd have to give up one.

In our state we have things called SOLs, where we take a test at the end of the year to see how we are doing. On top of that, we also have midterms. Not only that, but I have to deal with 2 different projects, and some stupid review bullshit that I have to keep up with or my teacher will make me stay after school to get help. I can't really deal with all of this. I wish I could do something to remove all of this stress. But no, it's the time.

"I don't really know where to start and right now I have no one to talk toI think this is going to turn into a wall of text so please forgive me.

I don't really know where to start but I guess starting with why I feel so helpless right now shall work.

Due to a lot of circumstances that have come about in the last few months I really feel like a shell of who I used to be. I have lost my friends, my best friend, and the girl I loved. I got a girl pregnant and things have gone downhill from there. I originally held on to the hope that the girl that I loved would be able to forgive me for all of this happening but I really had done the worst thing possible before than and caused her to feel unwanted by me. I was never dating this girl for a few reasons. I met her from a friend dumping her in a horrible way and I wanted to make sure she would be ok. We became great friends and really things were going great until I went on a planned trip to chicago for 2 week. When I got back she was with him again and she wouldn't listen to my warnings. I won't get into detail of all of this but it was a recurring theme. He would treat her horribly, she would break up with him and I would be there to comfort her and then she would get back with him. This happened many times over the past 2 years and the more it happened the worse I felt and the more useless I felt overall. After she did this one time and she was over with him there was a girl I really liked and hit it off with and all but really I think that I was doing it just to get back at Lindsay (that is her name by the way) for having just left me on the sidelines several times in the past like I wasn't even there.

It is hard just typing in this box because it doesnt feel like I am talking to someone so these things arent all coming out the way I would want them to but I wont go back and fix them. Anyway, during june of 2011 the house I was in was not one I could stay in anymore as my aunt and my mom were screaming at each other every night and I was sleeping in my car. A friends mom offered to let me stay there with them for free but it was an hour away. I stayed there and ended up having sex with the friend and she ended up getting pregnant. It really is a long story and whats done is done so I won't go on with that. Like I said earlier though, I was really holding onto the thought that Lindsay would forgive me for all of this, not so that I could date her really, just that she wouldn't hate me for it. She seemed pretty monotone about it when I told her and didn't seem upset really. I learned later though that she was back with her ex again and after that I felt completely helpless. I hadn't lost her but I hold in me the deepest hatred for the man she is dating and I can not be in the same room with him without thinking of how much I hate him with every fiber of my being. He has done so many bad things to Lindsay and she forgives him for everything every single time. Even the mother who KNOWS all of the things he has done forgives him. He didn't rape her or anything like that. He stole every penny she owned. He was 'dating' her for a year and never bought her a single present. He never took her out on a single date except the first day they went out. He spent every penny he stole from her to buy drugs and party with friends for a whole year. He stole every penny the mom had and when bills came in and she was broke, the mom went into $10k in debt. He verbally abused her when they were back together to make her feel like a whore. So many things like this and they forgave him every time. I feel like the words I spoke to comfort her after each of these things was wasted and when I think about it I feel even worse. And now she was back with him. She tried to continue including me into her life by inviting me to little events she had like band competitions and chorus recitals but he was there every time and I couldnt enjoy it. I hated every second of being there. 

On new years day I got the worst news I have ever gotten. They are engaged to be married. I was immediately more depressed than I had ever been in my life. Even more than when I found out I was going to be a father and I didn't have a choice. Even more than when I was treated like dirt as a kid. I felt useless and I still feel useless. I have to find a job to pay child support and where I live there are no jobs and if there is one you have to know english and spanish to have it. I had already thought that maybe I should join the Navy in order to pay for this child but that would also mean leaving everyone behind, even her, and it wasnt something I thought I could do. I was done after this though. I sent Lindsay a message telling her I couldn't deal with this anymore and that I was through. I told her I couldn't deal with what she had decided and that I could not remain friends anymore and that I would be completely distancing myself with her because every time I talked to her it hurt knowing that she was with him.

This girl was my best friend and the girl I loved and at that moment I felt more loss than I ever had before. I know that it has been only a month since then but for months now every time I have laid down to sleep I spend hours thinking about how I had ruined everything and all I could think about was her. She had forgotten but new years was the night anniversary of when I met her and the night before her engagement I was extremely depressed as it was. 

All I have been able to think about every night for month has been this girl and last night I had the most vivid dream of talking to her I had ever had it really is all getting to me. When I think about everything in my life, I feel more hopeless than I have ever been in my life and it has only been getting worse. I really am not suicidal as I know I wouldn't go through with that but right now I am sympathize with such an option. An escape as easy as suicide keeps coming to mind every step of the way and though I wouldn't do such a thing it really makes me feel worse and worse every time I think about it.

I am sorry for the wall of text. I know that people will say that I should get over a girl who is stupid enough to get back with her ex like that. I know things could be worse. She is the first girl that ever showed me what human affection is. Before I had met her I had never felt such a thing and now living without it hurts. 

The thing I most regret about all of this is that I miss the feeling of holding someone. The feeling of falling asleep with someone with them in my arms. I am crying just thinking about it. Sorry again for the wall of text, I just have felt more and more helpless and I just don't know what to do anymore",1

I'm not going to lie and say this isn't meant to be seen by anyone, but I'm here because the thought that one person may skim even a few lines of something I created brings me a little comfort.  Human compassion is all I've ever wanted.  
So I'm just going to reveal my shit and leave.  
I am engaged to a woman. I've openly been a lesbian since I was 13. My father died when I was 16. I have ADD, clinical depression,  PCOS,  and asthma.  Not a fun combination.  
I have a big long story about myself and the absolute doll of my life in my post history so I won't say too much about her.  But I have to include her in this because she is the only light in my life.  It's absolutely unfair she got fell in love with someone like me.  She's hilarious, adventurous,  and compassionate.  She taught me how to be ""somewhat"" responsible and was the only person who took care of me when my mother kicked me out after my father died.  Shes delt with me not being able to keep a job,  losing my insurance and quitting therapy,  my chronic pain,  and my inability to focus on anything we do together for years.  
I try like hell I swear.  I've put myself together and held the pieces together and maintained jobs for months.  Supported her when she lost her job,  and have sat for hours doing her favorite hobbies with her.  She's kept me up having sex until 6am and then I've stumbled into work at 7. I was in college,  but quit my second year. 

I know this is long but I swear it has a point.  I HAVE to get this out or I think I'm going to explode. 
Sometimes I am okay. When the lows are low I know that I'll get myself back on top.  But today is different. 
My family doesn't speak to me.  (Because you know the whole gay thing.) We live in one of the most homophobic states possible.  And I am all alone other than her. I am $30, 000 in debt (some from college but the rest from a ridiculous story about my mother) working minimum wage. 
I had a good job until last month.  I was making $15 an hour and was trying to pay back all this debt so I had my accounts set to auto pay.  Well I completely forgot about it and my $350 paycheck from my new job is now a $50 paycheck. My car insurance is due next week and it is $150. We have no money for food.  
I haven't slept and she's going to be awake soon and I have no idea how to tell her.  Her entire paycheck goes to rent, gas for the car,  etc.  I pay for food,  utilities,  phone bill and car insurance. 

Her family no longer speaks to her because of me.  They liked me when I was just her ""friend"" that needed a home but when they knew we were together that ended.  They've told her numorous times that if she left me they would take her back.  I would know she was fed and taken care of.  She wouldn't have all my stress on her shoulders.  I wouldn't keep being an absolute disgrace.  
Our moto has always been the cliché ""us against the world"" But I think that maybe that was just me knowing that her world would have been better had I not shown up.  I pulled her down into mine.  
I started this out saying I wasnt going to say much about her but somehow it all ended up revolving around her. That actually made me smile. I don't know what I'm doing or what my intent is with this,  but it feels good to get it out.  ",1

I am also still failing studying in my college trying to do all things that I need to do, but I don't really have that much motivation to do them really. And all of that makes my life look like absolutely worthless in almost every aspect. Also, as I said many times before in my previous posts that I want to create my own first game, well, turns out that its very daunting to make a game while being depressed and living like that, having zero experience in making games and coding, receiving almost no feedback on what I am doing and making my game free for everyone to play, which means that I won't gain anything for it.

"I've spent the last 6 years living a lie and I just want to end it all.Hey, my name is Beau and I've never posted on here before but I don't think I can keep all my pain I  anymore. I feel like I should start much earlier than 6 years ago so here I go.

When i was 3 years old I was diagnosed with a brain tumour. I spent 2 years in and out of hospital, I didn't even know what was happening all I knew was that my parents were letting these scary people in white jackets take me away and put me to sleep. I would scream and scream at my parents while the doctors dragged me away. I think this is where I first felt that I couldn't trust people and that I was completely alone. 
I got better after that and went to a nice school, it seemed like everything was fine. I made some great friends I still know very well today and I seemed to be adjusting well even though I joined school late.
Then I turned 8 and everything fell apart again, I got another brain tumour and this time I was older and wiser and so was more fearful than the time before. I knew what was happening and I didn't want to die. I won't go on about it again but obviously I survived but it left me with some complication. My pituitary gland had been damaged by Chemotherapy and so I couldn't go through pubity unless I had the help of synthesized growth hormones which I had to inject into my stomach every night for about 8 years. They worked pretty well though. I would never have grown an inch and I'd still be the height I was at 10 years old but I'm 5'9 which is fine with me. 
There was one problem though, I felt that my head was quite a bit out of proportion with the rest of my body because the growth hormones I was given were only experimental. I was bullied a lot at school for looking weird and it hurt my confidence quite a bit but I never spoke to anyone about it. Then I went to college and got to 're invent myself and it was great for about a year that then you realise you can't really change what you look like and even though everyone liked me I still got bullied by a few people but the thing that really bothered me was that none of the girls I liked wanted to go out with me. Well I know that obviously not everyone is going to fall head over heels for you but it actually feels a lot worse than being bullied because the people who are rejected you aren't bad people. They're good people, they don't bully you for how you look but they understand the bullying and thus don't find you attractive for the same reasons the bullies bully you.

Now let's get to the title.
I've spent the last 6 years living with a girl that I've been In love with for about 5 of those years. We've had an incredibly strange relationship. We were never going out. We never had sex. We never kissed. It's wasn't romantic for her. But we did spend all day sometimes lying in bed hugging and kissing each other anywhere but the lips. I was extremely confused because i told her I liked her but she said she didn't want to ruin our friendship. We've spent almodt every day together for the last 6 years. Im not a person anymore, I've lost my identity. Fast forward to now. She's decided she doesnt want to live with me anymore so she can go out with another guy. One that she wants to be with, he's taller , stronger and hotter than me. You can read the jealousy in my writing but she is my world and we've been together for so long that to me she was my other half. Now I'm alone. I'm having to move back to my parent and I actually just want to kill myself. The saddest thing is she doesn't even seem to miss me which lowers my self esteem two fold. I think the main reason I'm sad and she isn't is that I know that the time I spent with her even though she didn't love and never wanted to be intimate with me was still the best I could ever expect for myself. I'll be alone now for the rest of my life but she is beautiful and so will be fine. She find the things I gave her and more from her new boyfriend. 
I don't know what to do, should I just kill myself if the best time of my life is over now? I need some advice from people who won't sugar coat it.",1

the next thing is loneliness. because of how i look and how neurotic and depressed and listless i am i'm probably going to be alone forever, and i try my hardest to cope and accept that things are more important than having a boyfriend or a husband or anything like that but i do get hung up on it a ton

"Crashing from a manic episode and need a reality checkI've been changing my meds for what I initially thought were just depression and anxiety for the last few months. The most recent antidepressant I started on triggered a manic episode that has lasted for about two weeks, but is finally starting to taper off...I still haven't been eating or sleeping, but the unusual energy is burning off. I've already been prescribed a mood stabilizer, which I've been taking for about a week now, but it hasn't done anything yet. I'm still having a lot of racing, intrusive thoughts. Not necessarily suicidal ones, but lots about dying or people I care about dying. 


Does anyone have advice for dealing with unrealistic, intrusive thoughts while I wait for meds to help? It's been pretty worrying to still be feeling this way as I'm crashing back to a low. I don't have a plan to do anything, I just am especially scared of making stupid decisions as I try to force myself to stay manic for the sake of productivity as I'm crashing. I honestly haven't been able to help but to poke at it because the last couple weeks have been the most productive I've been all year.",1

"Have good days and bad days. Today's a bad day and I can't see it ever getting better.I've always been quite a nervous, anxiety and a big time worrier to boot however in the past year I think it's got worse. I'd say a combination of living by myself and subsequently smoking weed almost daily has not helped, I know smoking weed can be terrible for anxiety and I'll explain why I'm smoking further on.

So my girlfriend broke up with my 6 weeks ago and although I'm starting to miss her less and less I'm feeling a lot more lonely and helpless in general. I know why and totally understand why she broke up with me. I'm a total introvert and I'd rather spend time with myself than with her. I mean, I guess maybe I actually just enjoyed doing nothing at home by myself because I was too anxious to meet up with her. It was emotionally hard for me to invest with her because of my anxiety. And so I can totally understand why she broke up with me. And now I have all the time in the world to myself I realise that I don't want this either! 

I would even get so anxious that I would get butterflies when going out for a meal and would almost feel like being sick. Now you can see why my ex was happy to get rid of me when she couldn't even go for a meal with me. She loved me so much and I pretty much jeopardised the relationship just because of my anxiety.

Also, living alone has made me crawl more and more into my shell. Previously when I was living at home it was always good to have an excuse to get out of my parents way and meet my friends. But now I'm living alone it's kind of like given the choice I'd rather be conserving my emotional energy and being by myself. I've tried briefly living in a shared flat but that was even worse with arguments over rent, cleaning, being too loud etc. And even though I get crazy lonely by myself when I'm out with mates I find myself thinking of excuses to leave early to be at home. 

Living alone I smoke weed because if I was ""sober"" alone by myself I think it would slowly drive me insane and at least smoking weed makes me forget how lonely I am, makes me laugh at almost anything and dulls me. I don't actually want to smoke. Just the alternative scares me! I'm not even sure if it makes me anymore anxious as on the days I don't smoke I feel just as anxious. I'm sure I'll get judged heavily for smoking and this is probably my own fault. 

I'm slowly becoming more reclusive and introverted and I feel like it maybe too late to save me. I honestly don't know what it feels like to be normal anymore. I have bouts of anxiety attacks over what could be the most trivial things, such as going to the shops. I never used to be this bad. Or at least I thought I never used to be this bad. I always felt as if I'd snap out of the this but I haven't and I honestly feel like I'm fighting a losing battle. I honestly don't want to kill myself, but I just feel like things are never going to change and the only way to end this misery is to kill myself.

"Everyday, every unoccupied secondI am always thinking about it. How I will do it, how people will react, what to do for a note, everything. I am tired of having 1 friend (maybe they are my friend?). Nobody else cares about me. I have the people who completely ignore me, then the people that use me to fill the void until they see another friend. I can't do this.




Now, I will say something that will completely throw everything I just said out the window and make it all irrelevant. I am 15 and in high school. Here comes all the ""helpful"" advice of people telling me how life sucks for everyone, everyone feels that way, and it gets better over time. 



Now that that is out of the way, let's continue. About the 3rd day of school and I am already too stressed by the work. One class is just 40 minutes of absolute panic. The entire time I am an absolute mess trying to figure out what is going on and how to avoid being noticed. Honestly it is horrifying to me, I know it sounds ridiculous but it just is that way.





Then my parents. They always seem to be lecturing me on something or other. How I have no friends, how I have no motivation, how I have no hobbies, how I play games too much, how I am weak, etc. etc.. I don't know how I am supposed to get help with that. How will they respond? Will they give me another lecture on how some people have it worse and I am making it all up? Why bother.




Suicide is the only way out of this. There is something wrong with me as a person so people don't want to be friends with me or around me in general. It has happened so many times with different people it can't be a coincidence. Sorry for wasting your time with my pitiful existence and meaningless problems. ",1

This just reaffirms the belief that nobody cares and your a burden anyone that says they do is just a liar that feels pity. Basically my point is I am done telling people or making it obvious until I am either gone or can develop a genuine friendship prior to the person knowing I am suicidal.",1

"Need someone to talk to, x-post with r/depressionI need help.  Someone to talk to, or help me vent, something.  I moved to this new city, where I know nobody.  My wife and I both came here.  I was already depressed.

She was literally my world.  Even now, five months after we split, I'm desperately in love with her and don't know what to do.  But I hate her.  Kind of.  She had an affair.  Emotional for sure, possibly physical.  Especially with out it played out, I believe it was physical.  I've had a fairly rough life, with an abusive step-father, drug-addled mother, and growing up on my own as a lower class family on welfare.  I'm doing alright for myself, but I know nobody. 

I've always been a loner, because I grew up with one friend.  I confided everything in him, and he was all the support I needed.  Just the one person.  When I met my wife, I joined the military and we moved away.  She became everything to me.  I didn't need other friends (serious ones, I had work friends and the casual hang out friend), so when we moved away to this new town I once again knew nobody.

However, once we got here, we started growing distant.  She met this guy, started hanging out with him, and that was it.  She started going on dates, even spent my fucking birthday on a date with him, showing up past 5pm with gifts I specifically said I hadn't wanted (Fallout 4, had no interest in game) and having bailed on the one thing I wanted, that we always did (going out to dinner together; she ate with him).  

A bunch of other shit happened, I finally broke up with her.  I was scared, desperate, and lonely.  I took too long breaking up with her, and she just hurt me more and more.  I finally had to plan my own break up, because every time I tried previously, she'd sweet talk me back into staying.  How it would work out, etc.  So I actually plan my own break up.   Wasn't that a fun fucking weekend.

Now, it's months later, and I feel like I'm falling apart.  I've spent essentially four months completely alone.  I don't know anybody here.  I'm not on speaking terms with any of my family.  I cut ties with that original friend years ago because he took a bad path in life and was a terrible influence.  I just *don't know what to do*, and I'm scared because I feel like everything is falling apart.  And it hurts.  and I'm *scared*, because I can't control myself, or my thoughts, or anything.  ",1

That was one of her reasons. I know this is not much backstory but Today I am in my early 20s and I don’t see my life progressing In a positive way at all. When my mom would lock me up I would think about suicide. I was around 12 when she’d do this to me so I’ve been thinking about dying for a long time. It’s getting old and I’m growing numb to everything &amp; I just hate myself and my life. Idk what’s taking me so long to just do it.,1

What does it matter? Why even try? Its been literally thousands at this point, with not so much to show for it as a single happy memory. I'm feeling dissociated from reality.

Doesnt fit the narrative. Have a little money saved up. Maybe blow all of it on high class booze to kill my gut, attempt a little fun. Its gunna be messy, though.

"Pragmatic suicideThis might sound ridiculous, but I want to die, and I'm not severely depressed. I'm approaching this purely philosophically.

The way I see it, my life is more suffering than pain, and that's probably not going to chance. In fact, I would say this is true of most people. We spend most of our time doing things we don't want to do: working, cleaning, driving in traffic, feeling hungry, experiencing physical discomfort, etc, etc. Why would it not be better to not exist at all (I don't believe in an afterlife) rather than experience the totality of consciousness?

Now other people will mourn my death, this much is true. But they're going to mourn my death regardless of when it happens. No mourning is avoided by making it happen now. If anything, I'm at a point in my life when no one is dependent on me and my death will have the smallest impact it probably ever will. 

So why not die?",1

"A friend of mine is getting obsessed about killing people before killing himselfOk so this post follows [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/8guspf/friend_feels_like_hes_seen_it_all_and_its_not/).

Long story short, my friend who has been feeling suicidal and has attempted suicide already is willing to go through a last ditch effort at happiness. Except it's by killing people. He is convinced he is just not fitted for society and what doesn't work for society might work for him so he might as well just try and kill people because maybe it might make him happy and otherwise he'll just kill himself anyway so it doesn't really matter to him what happens next.

Obviously, I tried to reason with him by trying to understand how he'd come up with such an idea and how doing that is any different than trying to reach happiness by doing literally anything else but I feel like not only I am not being very convincing but I am essentially shifting my speech to ""just kill yourself instead"".

A tragic ballad - my lifeI'm in tears as I type this post. My world has always been a sinking ship. My flaws making me sink into the darkest depths of seas kept afloat by little patches for sometime. Lately I feel the patches have been too weak to keep me buoyant. I don't have love. I see people all around me finding love and moving on to the journey of their life. They find love despite their flaws and ceilings. It should be easier to find love. That's the one hole which cannot heal itself unfortunately. I really wish I were a microbe or other creature with no feelings. I really wish I was accepted by somebody. I turned 25- a quarter of century which feels like an eternal hell. I don't feel like the actual hell would be any worse. In another life all I need is somebody to love.,1

"Fuck man it's not worth it(heyyy nicholas if you end up reading this, not sure if you check my posts but I don't give enough of a shit to log into my alt)

My life, objectively, is pretty shit. I would appreciate if we could skip the whole ""other people have it worse"" thing and just take my word for it. My father is a narcissistic asshole, none of my friends are actually ever there for me, my physical health is fucking terrible, and my mental health has never been ok. 

I have a genetic disorder, I am only going to get worse as I get older (once again, please skip the ""oh you don't know that!"" my doctors have been very frank with me about how my condition will progress). I need double knee surgery already, at the ripe old age of 17. My future is just going to be pain and surgeries and doctors. I'm starting to doubt I'll ever be a productive member of society.

I have good moments, I love my cat and ceramics and being alive really. All of which make it so much more difficult to just admit that the pain isn't worth it anymore. I'm so tired of trying. I keep fighting and fighting and I'm never going to get better and what is the point? 

I keep making plans for my future, plans I look forward to. And then some bullshit comes along and ruins everything and I have to start over. For so long I've just rolled with the punches and tried to be strong but I can't anymore. I'm done starting over. I'm angry and hurt. I can't talk to my (flakey) friends about anything because no one gets it. My family is even worse. I'm supposed to just grin and bare it but I can't.

I don't want to die, I love life so much, but I can't carry on like this. Everything is so far out of my control, I can't fix any of my problems. I just feel so small and powerless. I know if I died people would miss me, it would be devastating. I know that I would leave a lot of people very fucked up over it. But sometimes I think their suffering would be less than what I have to face. 

It's like I keep having to grieve for these futures I won't get to experience and the past I missed out on. I don't know where this rant is going but I just don't want to feel like this",1

I miss him...I just... I dont know how to describe how I feel at this point... in late May a friend took his own life.. he was the happiest and nicest person I have ever met..

"I have fleeting moments of intense bravery and will-power and moments of panic-driven suicide attempts.I don't think I am bi-polar, but I've been through a fair amount of stress in my life. I was a caretaker of my aunt and two cousins, who were all dying of genetic disorders. I grew up with my cousins and I knew of their fate before they did. I also have genetic problems and they may kill, if not mentally cripple myself and my children. I am undergoing genetic counselling in two days because I would someday like a healthy biological family. I will find out then if I am able to have healthy children. My husband and I don't meet the qualifications to adopt. As far as support goes, his family dislikes me (understandably so) and my remaining family members are highly manipulative and abusive. 

(I have posted something similar under a number of names, but I thought I should update.)

Last night, I tried to commit suicide with sleeping pills and half a bottle of whiskey. I'm not a big drinker and I have a very quick metabolism, so I'm pretty impressed I'm still here. I haven't gone to the hospital, but I think I am fine. I ended up with just a horrible hangover and stomach trouble. I have called suicide hotlines before, and the last time was a very bad experience, so I didn't bother. (She just let me talk, wasn't apparently allowed to give me any advice and just said ""Are you done now?"" and hung up.) 

I honestly think that I am some kind of monster that was just meant to die, and by dumb luck I am still here. My last relative with genetic problems died several months ago, and I'm the only one left. Aside from moments where I feel like I have survived some horrible tragedy and I am somehow some strong person for doing so I mostly feel empty. It never goes away. I have never felt loved. I am only a burden.

I feel horribly guilty for living this long and troubling my husband, who has grown to resent me and occasionally will verbally abuse me. He'll call me rude, childish and imply I'm slow or racist. Whatever seems fit at the time, and has embarrassed me in front of both of our families by yelling. Once, when I fell asleep sitting up, he's grabbed my hair and screamed at me. This happened in front of several of his relatives. When I started having seizures in my sleep, he stopped any hint of becoming physically abusive and became gravely worried. Both of our families act as if his behavior is warranted, mostly because he's male and my behavior is very socially awkward. 

There is not much more anybody can do for me, as I am below the poverty line. I receive free medical health-care currently, however I cannot afford to drive to the hospital and they cannot provide transportation. If I cannot live a normal life, I have looked into euthanasia and would like to die humanely, rather than clinging to ill-health and no future.

Occasionally, I feel that I can achieve great things, and I'm trying to get a bachelor's degree. Sometimes I am proud for surviving this far, but I know that logically it's just a matter of chance. Sometimes I feel hope, and I don't understand why. I have never felt that sensation before, only a desire to die. It's happened very suddenly. I have considered running away and breaking off contact with all of my relatives, however I will be unable to take care of myself for various health reasons and may be in a worse position. I love my husband very much, and I know he is trying (he comes from an abusive home as well and learned a lot of his behavior that way) but I feel that I no longer can feel love for anybody near me, for whatever reason. Which leads be back to suicide.

Any insight?

"I've pretty much given upI've always been one to see meaning in nearly everything. As of yet, I haven't seen it in life. I had my dream job, my dream girl (we were engaged), I was fit, everything was fucking peachy. 

Long story short, everything fell apart due to stress, leading to drug abuse and alcoholism. There's actually a lot more that went into it, but I won't get into it.

I've decided that I'm gonna do it. I will end my own life. I have a specific time to do it, but not a specific place. I want it to have a meaning. I could go out in a blaze of glory by taking down as many neo-Nazis with me as possible, as I live pretty close to the party HQ. I've also considered going in front my ex-fiances house, and doing it on her front porch. She fucked me up in the head, big time. I would love to return the favor. My final option is to go back to the yellow footprints on Parris Island, and end my 2 year hell where it all began. 

I have attempted to take my own life before, but no no avail; the first time I was by the train tracks, and the MPs arrested me before the train came. The second time, right before I was being inprocessed to the brig, I swallowed 2.5 GRAMS of diphenhydramine, had a seizure, ended up in a three day coma. Both of these WERE NOT calls for attention, I must stress. I didn't tell anyone, I just wanted everything to end.

The only thing that's really stopping me is my family and friends. I care too much about them to leave them, but the pain won't leave me, no matter how many muscle relaxers, mood-stabilizers, or anti-psychotics I take. I've tried therapy. I've tried drugs (both street and prescribed), and the only thing that seems to help is opiates. I haven't taken any since May, and my demons seem to follow me no matter what I do. 

I've given up, reddit. What should I do?

To wake up every day alone is to suffer. I can't go a day without crying. I'm coming closer and closer to suicide. I have various methods at my disposal, and while I see the appeal of holding on to life, I'm losing hope and care.

"The hardest choices require the strongest willsI am really really tired of fighting with myself.
I have tried suicide a couple times before and unfortunately didn't succeed. As I'm writing this I feel loss for words to describe how exactly I'm feeling. I am tired and exhausted of everything around me. I wasn't a bright student, I dropped out of school in secondary 4. I've been ashamed to even tell my current friends about it. I often shrug it off when they ask me, ""what university do you go to?"". I feel pathetic, I feel like a loser and I have a soft heart which it a fucking curse. I cry easily, and often. I wish I wouldn't feel a thing, I wish I was numb. I wish I wasn't fighting myself constantly. I'm exhausted. I'm exhausted. I'm exhausted. I'm currently freelancing, after a failed business attempt. I freelance for a food delivery company, I'm barely hanging on, I often skip my session for the work because I can't help myself out of bed, I haven't eaten in days. Everything I do with the best interest in my heart comes to bite me in the ass. I am tired of living in this planet. Honestly I have been having suicidal thoughts a lot. I fantasize about walking into incoming traffic, overdosing on pills and drowning in the sea. (I can't swim) every night I go to the beach after hugging my parents that evening with no intention to come back, but every day my girlfriend ends up turning me around so I don't succeed, and I feel terrible for making her go through this thought of me suiciding. I fucking loathe myself because I don't want to hurt her and parents. But I'm exhausted of living. I cannot possibly let my parents know that I'm going through shithole.
My dad lost more than half of his life times saving because of me and my idea to invest in some financial trading , which we ended up getting scammed. This happened years ago and yet to this date I feel the tremendous guilt of it. I'm struggling hard to make money. I'm real struggling. I don't know how much longer I can hold on anymore. I'm so so so fucking tired. I walked through a rainstorm and I'm completely drenched now. I walked through a rainstorm on my way home from the beach today, it's 5am and I'm still on my way back. I really don't wanna live anymore. I just want to scream my lungs out. I want to hit something so hard, all this rage, anger, guilt and suffering. I just want the neverending pain to stop. I just want everything to stop. I want to cease to exist. I feel restless being at home, I haven't able to eat for 4 days. I've eaten 3 spoonful of rice in these 4 days. I'm struggling to wake up every day when it's feeling forced upon me. I'm abso-fucking-lutely tired. I just want to sleep and never wake up.",1

I've stood at the top of tall buildings unable to jump. The next attempt will definitely be hanging. 

I honestly have nothing to live for. 21F

I live with my narc dad and I hate him. Life here is unbearable for many reasons. 

Was bullied throughout growing up which led me to be mentally ill. (Social Anxiety, Body Dysmorphia, Depression and Borderline Personality Disorder) 

As such I'm too mentally ill to get a job to try and save up and move out because no one will be willing to hire a train wreck like me plus I have 0 experience. 

Too mentally ill to go to uni and study and even if I did I'd still end up at this hellish place every summer.

I have no friends and no relationship experience thanks to my mental illnesses and spend 100% of my time alone. Even when I had friends they saw me as a burden and never wanted to go out anywhere with me. 

Because of my age and the fact I'm not in education the chance of me realistically making friends are slim to none so I get to enjoy a life filled with loneliness.

I hate my body and my face (want/need surgery that I can't afford for above reasons) and think I'm too ugly to be seen in strong lighting so I never go out during the day. I only go out late into the night. Can't remember the last time I went outside when the sun was shining. Pretty sure I have a severe vitamin D deficiency. 

No matter what time I go to bed I always fall asleep at 5am due to stress and anxiety. When I manage to get up I realise that I have no reason to get out of bed so I'll just stay there all day despite having 5 alarms to keep me from sleeping. 

I'm burnt out, fed up and tired and most importantly **I don't want to try anymore**, so I'm just waiting for something to push me over the edge at this point.

Every time I decide to end it I back out with high hopes but things just end up getting worse. Maybe I'll finally do it on my birthday.

"My brother [33m] attempted suicide for the fourth time.My brother has been bullied since his childhood because of his weight and color. His first attempt of suicide was when he was in school and kids use to tease him because of his color. During his graduation, He called him around 3 AM at night from his hostel and told me he can't take any longer and wants to come home. I took a flight early morning and picked him from the airport. He was literally filled with filth and torn clothes. He took atleast a year to recover, he took several counselors help and was able to complete graduation and masters with distant education. 

I tried to be as supportive as I could but it was only when it reached the boiling point. He was very good in hiding his pain. Financially, I helped him to get appointments and support to pay his counselors. Once I got job overseas, it became harder to be emotional support all the time and it was mostly financial support. Mistake i made was, I gave him more than he needed.

He was never able to become independent. I think I was responsible for that since I aided just too much that required money for him thinking he needs it but eventually he just got use to it and never attempted hard enough (IMO) to be independent. Now, i told him i will not send funds over but only pay for his counselling sessions other that that he should start working on his own. This was heavily influenced by the decision when I brought him to my location at overseas for 4 months because he said he needed a break before he gets a job. I had tough time convincing my wife to accommodate him. She was fair IMO, she was fine having parents over my place but she was adamant about my brother being independent and not been spoon fed. She felt I have been too sensitive and soft towards him which is right because I really cared for him. I just felt that I need to be very sensitive about him because he has attempedt suicide several times, I heard so many stories where people say to support a person of that condition and regret they didn't do it after they lost him/her. I dont want to be in that position of remorse. I wouldn't forgive myself if I lost him.

After 4 months when he went back, he still didn't put an effort for getting a job or being independent, he said he has become more depressed. this really made me upset and had a stern conversation with him and said i won't aid him anymore until my mother (who is bed ridden) convinced me to atleast support him for counseling fees. My father is aloof from all this. My parents, in a nutshell have been critical to all of us and never were very supportive. 

Yesterday, he called me and broke down. He said he has attempted suicide again. He wants to come to my location again. He is basically frustrated being at home, doesn't know what to do in life. He is just sick taking care of mother, cooking for her and have no goal of his own. I had arranged for maids and care taker for my mother but apparently it is not enough . In a way he thinks its a route of escaping his dreaded feelings when does all these household chores. I spoke to him for half an hour and calm him down. He felt OK after that but I had to start conversing with my father to be open with him and try to understand and support him. I passed on new counselors contact details and told him to stop meeting the current counselor and  get a new one. 

He is just frustrated that he can't step out of the house, his anxiety and low self confidence takes the best of him. He is not very open about his issues. At one hand, I have empathy of all the mental illness he is facing but at the other hand, I feel he is taking advantage of my softness and never wants to venture out and just have chill out life spending money i have been sending him. I am not sure how to help him, he is talented and well educated (Masters) but he just doesn't know how to step out and position himself in the society and work. 

tldr: my brother is suffering from bipolar. He was bullied throughout his life. At one end, I tried to help my brother with emotional and financial support but at the other end, i feel he is just chilling out and it is making him think that he does not need to be independent since i will take care of things. I am not sure what to do. ",1
"Honestly, im just readyIt would hurt everyone too much. Truly though, I am a burden. I am sick too often. I have used up all of my sick days at work. They must think I'm useless. I don't make much money, and finding a job or degree that could point me towards making more seems hopeless. I look at job listings every day. I can't do retail/food/manual labor and that's all there is here. My anxiety sucks. I'm hard of hearing, and my speech suffers from it. I've been bullied my entire life. Interviewers have turned me down upon hearing how I spoke. I contribute nothing and I'm afraid I never will. I have tried so hard. Exercised. Ate better. Therapy. Pills. The pills just made me fat and ruined my sex life. I don't know how much longer I can go, I just want it to be over. People might miss me, but they didn't want any part of helping me either. I know it could be worse. That makes me sadder. I am ungrateful. I know it. I just want to go to sleep and not wake up. Give my organs to people who would appreciate them more.

"I want the human race to diePeople are a fucking plaque this Earth. All we're doing is slowly destroying Mother Earth with pollution, climate change and a WHOLE bunch of other shit. I fucking hate people and I want to fucking kill myself because of them. Fuck them all. Fuck 99% of the human race. All humans do is breed, complain, eat and lack intelligence. I don't even see myself as a human anymore because I seriously cannot believe I'm apart of this. 

Don't get me started on the animal cruelty. Fair enough that the disgusting human race has to kill them for meat, but Jesus fuck, DO IT PAINLESSLY. I'm sick of it. This is what triggered my hatred for this world. I seriously would love to see a bunch of useless humans be locked up in cages for their skin, for breeding and for food, and then slaughtered. It would be fun. 

As a lesbian, I'm especially exposed to constant homophobia from my family to the rest of society. I'm sick of fucking retarded heterosexuals, and other shitty LGBT members be fucking stupid and shitty. Stop asking stupid questions like ""how do lesbians have sex?"" For example. I'm sick of their stupid asses saying ""lesbians are virgins if they haven't slept with a dude"" or some other dumb shit. Mind your own business. When heterosexuals complain""stop rubbing LGBT shit in our face"" I want to skin them alive. I had NO representation growing up until I fucking discovered glee when I was 13. It sucked and I was always confused, and I felt like killing myself (still do) when I realised. Fuck off. 

I hate humans. Yes, I can have connections to other humans, but there's still going to be a part of me that hates them because they're human garbage. Must also explain why I hate my ugly ass too. 

I hope this whole race gets killed slowly and painfully.

"I think I will die from Suicide really soonMy life is endless suffering, I should go to
Psychiatrist a week ago, but slept over the meeting, I definitely have Bipolar disorder and OCD and probably BPD and tomorrow I'm going to get my Diagnosis from Migraines, I do have so many targets in my life,THEY'RE GOOD, but takes all my energy to achieve, I don't believe in anything but myself (I'm not religious at all), there's nothing after death, what was before you was born the same after you will die, nothing, it's like dream without dreams, breathing, organ functioning and awake state after you woke up, You're dead, dead means dead. I failed so many times, now things improve but still I'm suffering everyday, I ended school 4 days ago, I want to be YouTuber and I live in Europian country I'm 15 and a half, I'm beautiful and a good guy, everyone loves me, but, I feel bad all the time,

I attempted Suicide in Februrary, when I had noone to text about how I feel
I hung myself on my belt in my cupboard
Lost consciousness
I wasn't breating

And then it broke

My eyes wre closed still when I fell in cupboard incredibely confused and couldn't move for like ten seconds, I started screaming HEEELP HEEEEEELP, MOOOOM and I was soooo scared, because I ACTUALLY ALMOST DIED
I called suicide hotline and said I will never do it again
I was wrong

I think about it again and I made a date when I will do it, if I will, still deciding

I have access to illegal drugs, I think about to buy Diazepam

I thought about synthetic opioid + Xanax but, I realized my friends will not ever buy and sell me opiods

"I'm sick everyday, lonely, disability, life ruined.I saw my therapist today and she was about an inch away from sending me to the hospital psych ward. I spent a week there 2 years ago for less suicidal thoughts than this. 

I've been fighting an IBS flare up since January. I have no appetite and have to force feed myself. Some days I only eat bread and/or animal crackers. I have chronic sinusitis issues that give me horrible sinus headaches nearly every day until I take a handful of ibuprofen. I also have severe chronic psoriasis on top of my (balding) head and all over my face under my bears and on my nose. I don't leave the house anymore unless I have a Dr appt or to pick up meds. 

I can't hang out with my friends bc my stomach is always in pain and I never know when or how many times I'll need to use the restroom. 

I'm 34 and live with my parents because I was a software engineer and being in a cubicle for 8-10 hours a day everyday and coming home to an apartment by myself sent me in my first tailspin that put me in the hospital. 

Now I feel like I'm just being tortured by my illnesses that the doctors can't seem to figure out how to help. My anxiety and depression is through the roof. 

The ONLY reasons slowing me from killing myself are that my cat Brutus loves me and is scared of all other people and I don't want to leave him. And then I don't want to make my friends and family mad at me for killing myself. So I endure this tortured horrible lonely life mostly for Brutus. I have a detailed plan that is simple and fool proof. 

I'm on disability since I can't work. I can't leave the house. My therapist kept trying to find someone I know to help me but there is no one. No one that understands and could handle my level of suicidalness. 

I'll probably have to go to the hospital this weekend but my parents and sister are in Canada right no on a mini vacation and I need to take care of my cats and my sisters cats. 

I don't think the hospital will help anyway. I'm on so many meds they barely fit in my pill box. They help sometimes but right now is not one of those times. 

Tldr: I'm allowing myself to be tortured by my chronic illnesses and not killing myself because my cat Brutus would miss me too much and everyone else would just be mad at me. ",1

And each time it's just...so fucking nice, you know? In my dreams, I'm usually aware that I'm about to die and have absolutely no means of stopping it. Just before impact, I can feel myself overwhelmed with peace and I think, ""Finally, this is it. I'm done, it's over, and I had a pretty good run."" When I wake up, I feel briefly refreshed, almost as if it had actually happened. I love those kinds of dreams. I had a sort-of, kind-of near death experience in real life once and it was the same thing: just the most amazing, calming, ""yeah, let's go"" kind of feeling. I honestly don't want to kill myself. I don't want that kind of responsibility and I don't think it'd be fair to go until I've sorted out some shit and I can barely even shower everyday, so that's no happening anytome soon. But if death came hurtling out of the sky, I'd be like, ""Yes, finally. I'm ready. Take me now.""",1

"I just wrote the note for my parentsI'm not pulling the metaphorical trigger quite yet, but I am ready to, and I wanted to make sure that I had my note written by that point so that I could explain somewhat to my parents why I did what I did.  I'm posting it here so that anybody who has any advice that could help me has an opportunity to present it before I finally end it all.

""Mom and Dad,

I am writing this while I still have the mental faculties to do it.  I don't necessarily know if I am going to kill myself today or tomorrow or next week or at all.  Thus, I did not necessarily write this note on the day that you found it.  Instead, I am keeping it with me as a precaution, since when I decide to pull the metaphorical trigger, I want to make sure that you at least have somewhat of an explanation, which should hopefully gain you some closure.

First and foremost, I am so sorry that I decided to be so selfish.  Mom, I know I promised you that I would not kill myself while you were alive, but the guilt of the pain my death would cause was no longer powerful enough to combat the pain and grief that I have been dealing with.  I was to the point where I was simply biding my time until you died so I had the clearance to kill myself, and eventually the waiting itself was too painful.

Secondly, this is not your fault.  The two of you were fantastic parents.  I know you would be there for me in my every need, but eventually, I needed to stop being taken care of by my parents.  Unfortunately, no one else including myself could fill that role.  I needed an ally to walk with me, not eternal caretakers.  I needed something that you simply could not give me.

My relationships are disastrous.  I am sick of feeling like a leech to all my friends, so scared of pushing them away that I push them away.  I am sick of being rejected by one person after another.  While I have multiple friends for whom I would drop everything and stand by their side for weeks if they were in need or in danger, I clearly don't have any friends that are willing to do the same for me.  No one knows how to deal with a suicidal friend.  Everything I've heard to this point is “call this number to talk to someone,” “talk to your therapist,” “don't be alone.”  However, nobody is willing to stand by me.  Basically, every one of my friends wants me to get help in that “I'll pray for you” manner.  They want me to get help, but they don't want to be the one actually standing by my side.

The fact that I can't get a woman that I have any interest in to even give me a chance coupled with the fact that I don't have any friends who are willing to get in the trenches with me and help drag me out is just proof to me that I am hopeless with relationships.  I get hurt each time.

I'm sick of getting up off the metaphorical mat and getting knocked down again.  Each time I like a girl and give myself hope she'll give me a second thought only to have her turn me down hurts so badly.  Each time I am up in the middle of the night aching for an ally only to realize I have no one to turn to aches so deeply.  Every time I get my hopes up and stand up, I get knocked back down.  Well, I don't want to get knocked down again.  I don't want to get up off the mat.  I want to throw in the towel and not subject myself to any more blows.

I simply don't have the energy to endure any more blows while waiting until my death won't hurt you.  I pray you'll forgive me.  I know this will hurt you forever, and I wish I were less self-absorbed so that I would take that into account, but I am simply in too much pain to deal with it any more.  I love you guys, and I am sorry that it had to end this way.""

If you want any more information about me, I posted yesterday as well.

Edit: I know just like my last post, I posted and then didn't respond to answers.  The issue is that I am posting late at night when the loneliness is at its worst and I am exhausted.  Since good answers typically take time to come, I end up falling asleep.  Then I get up and feel better in the morning, not great, but at least not at my wit's end.  I also end up going to work, and thus I don't have a lot of time to respond.  Just know that I am reading everything you guys are writing and I really appreciate the encouragement.",1

"is it okay to be mad at my sister for killing herself?why. I just don't understand, she never talked to us about her problems. but looking from the outside. she has everything I've always wanted. i look at my sister and I see someone who could do anything, excell at anything. She has a large circle of friends, she graduated college on time, got a job straight out of college in the field she wanted, has a boyfriend.  She had everything I wanted to have in my life at her age. . My parents love her more than they ever loved me, and it's not hard to see why. She's everything they wanted in a child. I'm 30... still in school, i can't do anything, I'm overweight and lazy. I've spent my entire life alone, no social network, no girlfriend. She's achieved everything.

Why would she do it, why would she leave our parents with me. why leave them with me as a failure of the family. I'm the one who should of killed himself long ago, but just like everything else. I cant do it, and she can. 

&amp;#x200B;

i don't understand. I'm so alone, everyday is so awful, I sit in silence unable to communicate or connect with anyone. I've wanted to die so many times, but I always told myself it would get better, but it never does, it never did.  I never had love, I never held anyone or been wanted ever.  what was so bad that she did that. Maybe if I died instead of her, she owouldn'tf done it.

I see my parents, they don't even want to talk to me, they don't want to look at someone like me.  I remember so clearly the differences between us. She always had a birthday, friends, mom and dad would give her gifts. I never got anything after middle school. I don't even remember the last time someone wished me a happy birthday. They were so happy when she graduated college, they bought her a nice used car and help with her new fancy apartment in NYC.

When I graduated, they didn't even realize it, they just told me it was about time.

Remember the times when you were self harming and listening to music and baby dont cut came on and you dropped your blade and started bawling, thinking how your then girlfriend would react if your dead. Remember the day that she broke up with you, how she turned everyone you thought loved you against you, remember how she spread lies about you, remember how that night you grabbed the knife again to try to kill yourself, but you couldn't go through with it, so you ended up just self harming instead, you marked up your entire arm that day. Remember the tears you shed as you felt trapped and forced to say things you never would ever want to say, after all, you were just a kid. Remember when you were forced to tell her secrets and had a panic attack when she threatened to tell them to everyone. Remember the fear and pain you went through when you were assaulted at age 11. Remember when you were groomed by a high schooler at age 11. Remember the time your ""friends"" said you deserved to be assaulted, they called your a whore, they called you a slut, they said you were asking for it. Remember the literal years of torment over having dark arm hair, which is part of your culture, your race, how its something you cant control. Remember when you begged your parents for years to let you get rid of it, but they said no, because them believing their stupid theories were more important then your mental health, than you getting bullied for every single year at school. Remember how you'd cut and starve yourself at age 11. Remember how you'd give away your lunch because you ""weren't hungry"" even though you hadn't eaten since yesterday's breakfast. Remember when you came to a new school, and how your friend threw away all your blades and made sure you ate everyday because she was worried sick about you. Remember when in choir you were punished and not allowed to do what other kids do, not because you were actually being bad, but because you were standing weird, which was because your knee had twisted again. Remember when you fantasied about shooting or hanging yourself. Remember all the times your parents yelled at you about how they were getting rid of your cat when they knew she was your only emotional support. Remember when they turned you into the bad guy for not wanting to move again because you already changed schools more times than they did by the time you were 12. Remember how much separation anxiety you had from moving schools almost every two years. Remember all the nights you stayed up until 5 because you didn't want to have another nightmare. Remember how every night when you tried to talk to your dad about your depression, he told you how others were having it worse and i didn't have a good reason to still be ""depressed"". 

If you're still alive. Look at all you went through. Think about how more there is to come. Its your choice to fight the battle or not. But I doubt you'll ever read this, because you'll never exist, because I'll probably never live until age 18.",1

"Suicide seems to be my only option. (TW: rape)This will be long. I'm 22F. So to start from the beginning, my father was emotionally abusive as a kid (for example: he'd threaten to kill my mom and kidnap me and take me to Mexico, literally tried to hire a hit on my mom, threatened to sell me into sex slavery etc.). I also developed a phobia of dogs as a kid. My father used this against me by threatening to lock me outside with his two dogs (German Shepard and a large mutt) if I didn't do what he said. For example, he'd call my mother a bitch and if I tried to defend her he'd threaten to lock me outside with the dogs. So I did whatever I had to in order to appease him. 
Well, in third grade my mom moved us out of the state (away from all family unfortunately) and I've never seen him again. He got locked up when I was in middle school (unrelated charge) and has been in prison ever since. My phobia of dogs became way worse because of him so I was too scared to play outside or go to friends' houses as a kid. So I have always been a loaner. Eventually I became terrified of all insects too, which also made me despise leaving the house. 
Started developing severe OCD/depression/anxiety/suicidal ideation in middle school. Also became terrified of demons/evil spirits, convincing myself that there were demons in the house. I have at many times been convinced that I was possessed by a demon. For years I have even sometimes hallucinated shadow figures, spirits, and insects. I also have severe derealization and depersonalization. This causes my memory to be terrible. Sometimes I don't even recognize my own face in photos.
When I was 17, my dumb ass started selling weed (maybe as a way to make me feel less numb) so I started putting myself in bad situations because, again, I'm a fucking dumb ass. I spent the night at a 21 year old guy's house and I had sex with him once consentually. Then he raped me later that night. I was too scared to fight back cuz he had 2 big dogs in the other room, and he had them kind of as guard dogs so they were not friendly. Then I think he drugged me after that cuz things got hazy and I was really out of it. He left the room and told me to lay on my stomach then I heard his two roommates come in with him (but the room was pitch black so I couldn't see) and they all raped me (in all possible ways) and eventually I passed out but woke up in the morning and was bleeding; it hurt so fucking bad. He acted as though nothing happened. Again, I was too out-of-it and scared of their dogs to fight back. When I got home I noticed w*sps outside and became terrified, marking the beginning of my crippling phobia of w*sps. I can't say the word so don't comment that word without the asterisk please. I think of their $tingers as dicks so when I see one I kinda think they're trying to rape me. If that makes any sense. 
Then i started hooking up with a 34 year old and one time i went to his house and he had been drinking and i made it very clear that i didnt wanna have sex but he raped me anyways. Then one time i was selling someone an ounce of weed and he robbed me and raped me in the back seat of my car. All 3 rapes happened within a six month span. 
So the phobia of w*sps/dogs is so bad I literally only leave my house for work and even then im terrified. No one understands. They all just say to get over it. Therapists are all useless. 
So obviously I have no friends. I go to college online (I wanna be a teacher) but am so depressed I gave up a week ago, didn't do any of my midterms, so of course I'm failing all those classes. I have body dysmorphia and hate myself with a burning passion. I'm 5 foot 6, 103 pounds but still think I'm fat as fuck. I can see my ribs and hip bones, but I have a large bone structure so I'm still fat. I starve myself to lose weight (I wanna lose 15 more pounds) and mainly only consume calories in alcohol. It helps to numb my emotions. I may lose my job cuz I'm too scared to leave the house. Men always leave me cuz im fucking batshit and am often too scared to leave my house. I cant blame them. I am utterly unlovable and pathetic. I wanna die.",1

"The Dream Of A GhostTo whom it may concern

I sincerely apologize that my actions have hurt you so deeply and it was never ment to harm you, only the tortured soul that resides in my body. As I have gained more knowledge I equally have gained more problems, I thought they were phases every youth goes through but I severely mistaken. I struggle to keep eye contact with known associates and my heart rate accelerates when I say something I am not fond of, I have terrible and cruel body image and constantly judge myself unfairly every time I see my own reflection but this is only the ""physical"" aspect. mentally my emotions are....naive and sometimes it gets so crowded in my head I cant think or hear myself speak, so many different voices all yelling, screaming at me I need to change, I need to disappear, saying that maybe if I get a knife and skin myself alive it'll help me lose weight quicker so maybe I will be more appealing to the population. I dont belog here
I dont feel right in this human skin
I dont think like the rest of Them
I dont see like the rest of Them
for years I thought it was just ""hormones""
but it is the nature of what I am
I dont belong in this universe
this air is poisonous to my lungs
I fear I am being attacked every time I am looked upon
maybe I should be for housing such horrific and evil thoughts
I see dead people that havent died yet
They know it thats why they put me here
in another place I've done unspeakable evil
so I've been put here to suffer amongst the clueless
to live amongst livestock
I dont know how many times I've lived
but im tired
so so tired
constantly being overlooked and misinterprete
constantly being removed from an option
constantly taken advantage of
no person has condemned me to such suffering and sick twisted thoughts
it was all me and the Others
I did this to myself

I see the world for what it really is
where the skies are black
and colors do not exist

where human emotions are just folly's of the brain
and love is an illusion

where every human is born to suffer in society
but destined to die alone

we are we created to be destroyed
no matter how monumental your actions may be...you will always be forgotten, washed away forever by the unstoppable tsunami of time

all the Devils have left hell and are amongst us because the world we live in is worse

If you are reading this I am in a coma, dead or dying but most likely the former, I wish no malice or ill intent upon my family or friends as they did not guid me to this choice, but the opposite. I just want who ever is trying to kill me slowly to stop but they wont so I've taken the best choice of action, I just might wake up from this simulation.

"Holy crap I’m backIs that what this account will be? Pouring my heart out to strangers high on my latest fix, low on my latest failure, left to plateau with my head just above water? I’m breathing but barely, and too much. Breath caught in my throat in almost sobs, a deep breath in for that life saving smoke, that smothers all else, even at the cost on my conscious. Such expensive habits, only slightly more effective than nothing at all. But I cling to my vices for just on more step down and I may actually cry, whether I allow it or not. But the world doesn’t stop for misery, work isn’t canceled for the headache from long repressed tears. I only wish I had enough left of me to remember how I survived before my addictive indulgence. I push these feelings out by force, blasting my ear drums into an even sadder state, erasing and rewriting until the feelings come out just right, until I’ve run out of steam and lie helplessly in bed as though I’m in a coma waiting for someone to pull the plug. Even when nothing’s happened today to cause such a spike, my medications taken, my life unchanged. No worse for wear, but no better. Is this my lowest? A faceless stranger with a story so tragic only for you to see and wish you could help, and wishing for help yourself. I’m not sure why I’m writing here again. Perhaps I crave that level state, not feeling good but no longer feeling as though I could just will my soul to leave my body and for once, truly rest.

"I'm staying busy, but it doesn't feel like I'm going anywhere and I hate it.Hey, /r/suicidewatch.

I've been dealing with depression since highschool, but since I graduated May of 2014, it feels like it's gotten much, much worse, and I'm starting to just wish I was gone.

Part of this is because I still live with my parents, I'm sure. I had the grades to get into a university, but I opted out, choosing to go to community college because fuck debt, amiright? Anyways, living with my parents is a problem because they're religious, I'm not. That's just part of it - we don't see eye to eye on most things, but I'd never tell them that.

However, they did recently find out I smoke. Nothing too heavy, just a hookah pen with a small concentration of nicotine. Because of this, however, they decided they were going to ban me from using the Internet, because ""if they don't punish me, I won't learn."" It's like I'm a child to them.

I don't hate my parents by any means. If I'm being objective, they've been good to me, but living under their roof only adds onto what I consider my problem: I'm not going anywhere.

I've got excellent grades, I work often, and I'm working on getting my driver's license, but regardless, it feels like it's all for nothing. I have quite a few friends, but it doesn't feel like they really care, which I have discussed with them. They think I'm overreacting. 

I really just don't want to wake up tomorrow. ""I think I'm moving, but I go nowhere."" 

Perhaps the only reason I'm still alive is because I don't want anyone to mourn my death. I know how I'd end my life, and I really, really would if I didn't think about all the grieving that would follow.   I just wish I could fade away.

This might just sound silly, but it is how I feel.",1

I'm terrified of killing myself. I'd probably fuck that up and live the rest of my life with a serve disability or brain damage. I don't want to put people close to me through any bereavement either.

I have no fucking clue why I'm on reddit. It's coming up to midnight and I've spent my whole friday in my room, crying on and off and watching random shit on youtube and netflix.

I am sick of looking for a ""light at the end of the tunnel"" that never shows up, or if it does, turns out to be me just fooling myself.

The woman I think I love told me today that I should just go ahead, because I'm ""so pathetic"".   Last night she told me the only reason she is even my friend is because she ""feels sorry for me"".   She's got issues of her own and I think she is sick of my depression bringing her down.

I have been unemployed for over a year and a half, I've gotten a couple of jobs but was unable to keep them for very long, so I'm broke and collecting food stamps (unemployment ran out a long time ago).

I'm an ex-junkie, and lately I've been thinking about getting back on dope just for the psychic pain relief, but I couldn't afford it if I wanted to.

"What Have You Done to Not Kill Yourself Today?I've been on this subreddit for months under a lot of different accounts. I've been the one helping others sometimes, sometimes I'm getting help. This sub's seen a few posts from me directly before or after a suicide attempt and ones during and after hospitalization. It's a great form of support during those times when no one in real life seems to understand or know what you're going through or what you're feeling.

That said, this subreddit is missing something. I understand that the ""it gets better"" ideology is patronizing, but those at the end of their rope will gravitate towards a place like this where they can be heard and they need something to inspire them to take steps to live another day. I think we need a pinned thread, possibly a daily one, where people can acknowledge and be celebrated for the things they do to keep themselves alive each day. Something like the fatlogic sub having daily health achievement threads.

I got new friends, and they don't show interest in me whatsoever, only when its convenient. My last two relationships with girls, they just used me to get back at someone else. The worst thing is, at the end of it all, I've always been the problem. I haven't had anyone genuinely apologise to me for such a long fucking time, its been over a year now. Every conflict, argument or problem (school or social) I get in, Im always the one having to apologise. I don't think I was made for this world, 2021 will be the last.",1
"I’m gonna end it soon.Have you ever felt not good enough? Like everything you do someone is there to do it better, like everything everyone has expected for you you just can’t do it. That’s me.

My mum is highly disappointed in me for everything I do man. This post won’t make a lot of sense but that’s because my brain is so muddled up and confused idk how to say everything that’s on my brain, except for what I’m thinking at the time so just bear with me. All I want is to be able to die, like living is complete bullshit, only music and sleep keeps me somewhat sane to be fair. I wake up and I feel pain and it doesn’t ever go away. I feel like I’ve lost my mind and I need help but I can’t find help from anyone. I feel like I make no difference on this earth and in my pointless life. I remember being happy a long time ago but I feel like I’ve genuinely died on the inside. I feel so worthless like no one would even be at my funeral tbh. Every day is wasted in my life because there is no reason for me to be here, I do nothing right but I’m gonna do this shit right, I’m gonna finish it tonight. ",1
"In 2 years, or in 20 yearsI don't really feel like suicide is a matter of if, for me. More like a matter of when. I have a cut off point in mind. It might take 2 years or 20 to get to that point. Maybe more, or maybe less. But I will kill myself eventually. I think about methods I will use, how I will get things in order, and what I want to do before I go. I think about these things a lot.

I want to die most days of the week. I have for a while now. I think I have wanted to stop living from a young age. I've been in therapy, I'm taking antidepressants, I'm exercising and working and trying to eat healthy. All the things they say to do. And, it does help to an extent--not to help me feel better about life, but to get me doing more in the meantime. 

Normally, I have a big list of goals I want to accomplish before killing myself. That's my compromise, I guess. It's what I came up with in therapy as a lifeline to stop me from going through with a plan. That's why I haven't killed myself yet. But, the thing is: life is unbearable enough now as an able bodied working adult. I don't want to stick around through old age, the loss of my mental faculties, or the loss of freedom and agency. I don't want to stick around through painful or debilitating illnesses. I don't want to stick around til I get to the point where my life is hanging by a thread and I rely on family who resents the burden and waits for me to die to ease their burden. I don't want to live to get committed to a hospice where I can do nothing but sit in bed and wait to die.

So, I will kill myself, eventually. Unless a freak accident mercifully gets me first. Normally I try to convince myself to stick it out longer to pursue the goals... but a lot of times, I don't even want to see the end of the week. I kind of feel like I am holding on out of sheer spite.

Does anyone else feel this way?",1
"No motivation to commit suicideHello, i've never tought i'd get here. Wow.... Lot's of fucked up things had happened in my life (they r that fucked up that i dont want to mention them here) I have no friends i doubt that anyone cares about me. I still go to school (yeah sure laugh in the comments). Well actually my parents care about me and i don't know why but automatically i act normal when im with them im scared to tell them how i actually feel inside. I kinda wanted to visit a psychiatrist but i never convinced myself to do it. All of this shit was building up inside me and trust me i would do it but i just cant get over the tought of what would my parents feel or think like maybe they would blame it on themselves. Another reason is that my grandma passed away about a month ago so pretty much both financially and motionally my parents are fucked my death would completely destroy my mom and her wallet. But im no fucking better i dissapointed her everyway i could and theres still things she doesen't know about me. I just dont know where to put all of the shit thats inside of me i'm literally between nowhere and the feelings inside of me are destroying me. Would i be a dickhead if i just did it idk leave a note that it's not their fault or smthng? I tried so fucking hard but no one ever noticed it and fuck it im tired.",1

"Last night was a big revelation So I used to really like this girl,letâ€™s call her Sophie, and last night I think I never stopped liking her (itâ€™s been like 3 years), I just stopped trying and it happened because I was at a party for my band section and she was there and we were talking just about anything and everything and I just kept getting lost in her eyes and just her being there.

But for the past few months Iâ€™ve been liking this other girl, weâ€™ll call her Em, and Iâ€™ve been slowly losing feelings and realizing that sheâ€™s not worth it. 

So old feelings are resurfacing again and I think Iâ€™m gonna ask Sophie out soon, because something has to be right for me to fall back in love with her after one conversation right?

The main reason Iâ€™ve been losing feelings for Em is that sheâ€™s just been dry, leaving me on delivered for upwards of 6 hours, been distant and just seems uninterested. As far as I know sheâ€™s okay, but I dunno if shes worth all the effort Iâ€™ve been giving. 

So yeah last night was a big thing for me and I think itâ€™s good",0

In the past month or two, my Mum has been dating this man she knew 20+ years ago, a former work colleague of my passed away dad.

He's a violent thug, a criminal and appears in court like it's his job (it isnt, no idea what he does, if he does anything at all). He's a failure of a man and I don't know what she sees in him. He's also coming into the home, living here 80% of the time, paying fk all, eating the food I buy and being a complete twat to me, setting new rules for me, when he has nothing to fucking do with me and I'd rather him to fuck off.

I only yesterday joined a Gym to lose weight, but I can't get there myself without someone, such as my mum, to take me, but I can't go because the cunt is always here. He just infuriates me.

I’ve been trying so hard not to because as I religious or as far as I am from my religious background. For some reason when it comes to killing myself i can’t not believe in god no matter how hard I try. It’s the only thing that stops me because the idea of hell terrifies me. I want so badly to not believe it’s real. The pain I feel every single fucking day is agonizing. I wanted to do it today and drove in my car around town thinking I could crash it. I didn’t because I don’t have the guts to do something like that. I drove to the lookout in my nearby town and I’m crying in my car typing this.  I’m in so much pain right now.

"Just gets worse and worseIt's 8 am and not one sign of sleepiness. I know I wouldn't go through with it, I've tried before a couple of times and ended up in a psych ward for observation and a $15,000 dollar bill. I was released, not diagnosed with anything. I'm a completely normal person, with just too much on my mind. I still miss an ex girlfriend more than anything, and she's made it clear she doesn't want to speak to me. Life goes on right? I'm also an illegal immigrant in the u.s. brought over when I was 8 years old. 14 years later and nothing has changed. I love working, but haven't had many opportunities. When I was 18 I worked overnight at a store, I miss that feeling of clocking in, doing your job, having fun with coworkers, and getting a paycheck in the mail every week. After that, I worked a couple of odd jobs. Last year my cousin hooked me up with a job in Richmond. I stayed there for 8 months, until my boss got deported. Those 8 months were great, working, having enough money to be comfortable, finally moved out of my parent's house. When I lost that job I moved back to my parent's, wallet running dry again. Then my sister gets me a job at her company, back to work. I lasted three months with a boss that always payed extra late, bounced checks, unorganized schedule, overworking myself to rarely make minimum wage. After 4 days of getting forced to work 12 hour shifts and exhausted I quit. Back to this depressing, tiny room in my parent's basement. A month goes by and still no job. I look around and I only have 2 friends, Denny and Johnny, who I love them to death. I am so lonely, all I think about is my ex from 2 years ago. I tried going out, getting drunk (because that's the only way I can talk to strangers) and end up getting arrested. Oh what's this? Before being released they have to notify ICE. Great, now I'm on removal process. Great, I'm facing being sent to my home country which I haven't been to in fourteen years, don't know a single person there. On top of that my parent's spent the last of their money on a lawyer. I wrote a letter to the president two weeks before he announced the thing for children of illegals, I hope he read it and that I may have had an impact for everyone in my shoes. It's funny, my boss in Richmond, the one that got deported? His daughter was valedictorian of her class, but wasn't legal. Accepted into Princeton but didn't have the money for it, so off to brazil she goes. I never told anyone before that I was illegal. So here I am, unwanted in the country I grew up in, pledged to the flag every day in school, can't get a job(because who's going to hire someone that's dealing with ice problems?) can't get over my first love (yeah I'm pathetic, but this girl meant the world to me, and not my most recent one, my first love, my korean ex) I have nothing to offer. I'm as pathetic as I don't have the guts to do it, but hopefully one of these days these sleeping pills and these bottles let me dream of talking to her again, hugging her, holding her close, and telling her I love her. That I could have a normal job, and not be a burden to my family.",1

"My wife had a breakthrough thinking about suicideOur daughter took her life last summer, and it threw us borh into the crisis of your lives. Rachel's response was top read up on it. Mine was to find a story that made it make sense. (http://mfinley.com/pdf/zombie-girl.pdf, if you're interested)

Rachel's breakthrouh occurred reading a book called SUICIDE AND THE SOUL, by psychiatrist James Hillman. Hillman's idea is that we all freak out when we hear about suicidal wishes. Like a fire department we all rush to the scene, and seek at all costs to prevent it.

Hillman suggests that the psychiatrist might be wiser to walk with the suicide to the lip of the abyss and stare down into it with him/her.  We still don't want the person to jump, but more than that we want to honor their journey to the edge of nonexistence.

He's just talking about psychiatrists, not folks like us. But there is something to this. Depressed people are not usually helped with chucks to the chin, promises of a better day dawning, good times being just around the corner.

In a way it is better to be a real friend, and acknowledge the pain that has brought the person to the edge. In short, to love that person and his or her struggle.

Some people, Rachel and I decided, including our beloved daughter Daniele, are involved in a dance with death. In a sense, they have already lived their lives -- intensely, often miserably. 

This accounts for a small percentage of those of us with suicidal urges. I'm talking the hard core -- the death's head kids. Daniele was such. When she died there were literally over a hundred plastic and ceramic skulls surrounding her.

Could she be saved? She was saved, once. But she took pains not to be saved the second time. No note, no longing glances -- even though she adored us.

What is the lesson of a kid like that? That suicide is very profound, and deserving of our respect. Sure, we don;t want one another to die. But we all will die. The trick is to know one another, to respect one another, so that when we do die, we aren't entirely by ourselves.

If you see someone having a hard time, don't be too quick with the wise words. Buy 'em a coffee. give 'em a hug. Listen to their story.

I got off the topic of James Hillman toward the end here. It was me talking, not him. I don't recommend reading his book unless you are a real good reader! But you got the gist of it right here.",1

"Caught at a strange stand-stillI've been planning to die for as long as I can remember. Countless plans have fallen through, due to changes in other's schedules that would result in them possibly finding me, me not being to able to write down everything I wanted and get mt affairs in order in time..... things like that.

This time, I finally got everything in order, and I have a real opprotunity in front of me. I have my will, my belongings, everything set to go, all my appointments and autopay plans are canceled, I have a clear plan on how to get my money in order as well, and a plan on how to make sure mt roommates/friends don't find my body. Finally, I'm. Set. As set as I'll ever be.

Buf I think I made a mistake in staying up all night to write down as much as I could. I'm so horribly sleep deprived I've lost steam, all I can think about is sleep. And I'm *sick*, incredibly, painfully ill all of a sudden, probably a result of days of very little sleep or food.

My plan requires walking a long long way in the cold to take care of the money. I have to make sure my roommates are set with that before I can die. But i feel *horrifically* ill. I don't even know if I'll make it.

So I'm caught at this strange stand-still. The plan is already in motion. I may not have this kind of setup ever, evdr again. I'm so tired. But I suddenly feel lost. Should I get up and go now, should I go to work and play normal somehow, should I sleep and then hopefully be able to fulfill the plan when I wake up......? 

I can't do nothing. The plan is in motion. I can't go ""back to normal"". I can't keep going like this. But I can't get up, can't go anywhere, but I can't just lie here until reality comes to get me one way or another.

I don't know if any of that made sense. I don't know why I'm even telling you all this. I just don't have anyone or anywhere else to tell.

I'm going...... to sleep, I think. And figure out what to do when I wake. I don't know. I don't know.",1

"I've given up trying to be happy and I just need someone to listenI have nobody else I can say this to so I'm putting it here. I used to have someone who made every day better, I was happy then but they're gone now. They never really cared about me and now I know that the happiest period of my life was nothing but a lie. I loved her more than anything in the world and now I don't think I'll ever be able to feel the same way about anyone again.

I've wasted my life sitting alone, hunched over in front of a computer instead of getting out there and living my life. I've never been to a party, gotten drunk, hooked up with someone and it feels like if I don't soon I never will. But I don't know how, I don't know anyone who would let me tag along or make sure I'm doing it safely and I'll end up spending the rest of my life regretting having never had these experiences.

I've been in such a bad place these last few months hat I've fucked up the rest of my life too. My grades have all dropped and I've missed the deadline for my university applications anyway so I'm essentially just thrown my life away. My entire family is disappointed in me because they all believe I could've done so well for myself but none of them understand how badly I'm struggling with everything.

I have nothing to live for anymore. I can't fall in love anymore, I'll spend my life wishing I was someone else and any chances of getting my dream job are down the drain.

I just want all the pain and hopelessness to go away. I want to stop being miserable and the only way I know how is to stop living altogether. I'm planning on doing it next weekend, after I settle a few things first. Then I can finally be free.",1

"No matter much I distract myself, suicide seems to be the only answerNo matter how much I occupy my time, driving, studying, walking outside, watching a TV show, Youtube, etc, everything just leads back to suicide. It’s like my brain is wired to think that dying is the only ultimate way to end the pain and be free from suffering. It’s like something I keep avoiding because I somehow convince myself that I actually should hold on. But in fact, it’s only hurting me more by lying to myself. It’s masochistic to me to force myself to keep living. Even when I read the Bible and pray, I become suicidal again soon after I finish. I was looking forward to getting a dog after my parents said I could but they crushed my hopes again when they said it was too expensive. I should have known good things don’t happen in my life. They’re heartless bastards. Not being able to have a dog is seemingly making me more suicidal which is weird because I didn’t expect a dog to cheer me up. I’m thinking whether I should experiment cutting my wrist more to entertain myself. I know it’s fucked up but the pain distracts me more than forms of entertainment like TV shows or Youtube.",1

"How do I help my 'depressed' friend? I am scared for his life.My long term friend admitted today that he was going to see a councellor because he is afraid that his mind is going like his fathers. I am not sure if it's depression but that's all I can guess right now. He could just be sexually frustrated as he hasn't been with someone for a long long time. It's also possible that he's gay and is afraid to come out so has kept everything bottled up. I am open to other suggestions.

His father died years ago, but for more than a year before that, his father changed. There was not much difference at home except he was 'going out' more. They found out it was to the pub, so he was drinking regularly. 6 months after that he (the father) apparently exposed himself to a younger female neighbor in his front garden (no proof, but his strange behavior made it believable). The police came to 'sort' it out. He also seemed to be depressed and just sat around the house watching TV. The drinking got worse until his life savings ran out to which he kept drinking on pension money until he died. He died in his sleep because of a trauma wound from falling down while drunk.

Anyway, my friend told me his brain has been 'funny'. He has been cranky with people recently and hasn't been spending time with his friends/family as much as normal (but still quite a lot). He has admitted to looking at porn a lot, and saying that some of it he probably shouldn't be looking at.

I have known this guy for 30 years. I am 40, he is almost that. I would do anything to help him but I don't know what I can do. Please help me Reddit. We are both male (not partners, just friends). I have already told him that he can tell me anything and that if he needs anything to just give me a call to talk it over. I also told him if he needs a special 'holiday' somewhere that could help, I would go with him too (if he wanted). I have also told him that looking at porn a lot isn't weird or anything.

I could do with some advice. Thanks for any suggestions you can give me.",1
"I can't wait any longer4 Years ago. I attempted suicide by hanging, it failed. I did it Because I'm a failure. because I have been endlessly harassed and bullied for being so fucking worthless to society ever since the days of junior high. In the end, I was motivated purely by my hatred for the twisted irritating people in my life who aspired for me to do this, People who BEGGED me to kill myself. (Almost my entire grade in school) Because then I started thinking ""This is what they want.... If I do this they win""

So I stayed. And i told nobody what I was thinking. and I tried fighting. It went........ ok for a while. I figured if I pushed myself to the limit in school I can get a good enough education to escape this horrific place I live in. Thats all I wanted. To be free from this hell hole of a town in Canada. But the problem is that I literally am worthless and stupid. I studied non stop and obtained perfect attendance across all my years of high school. And it meant NOTHING. i barely passed most classes and all the teachers say I'm a lost cause at this point. I'm at the last year of high school and just failed the math course and I am once again being berated by every single student and teacher. How fucking pathetic of me. These last 4 years have been a  waste of my time. I should have done it long ago. I see now that it's not that they all win. Its that they were right. I'd rather be dead than to spend the rest of my life in this horrific town anyways. The only thing stopping me right now is that i don't know how I'm gonna do it.",1

Yesterday, I had enough. I packed up my belongings from my desk and walked out. I had a look at my finances and I can afford to be jobless for a while. I'm going to seek therapy from my GP on Monday and perhaps ask him to sign me off sick for my week's notice.

I don't know why I'm wasting my life, maybe the nonchalance and apathy while walkihg to the slaughterhiuse is my indication of how much I am disconnected from my life.
The means with I am destroying myseld is fenfanyl. A very strong opioid. I am bining on it. I'm not a drug addict, but I am a slave to my pain that I don't even know the source of anymore. I just don't want to feel myself living. I despatately want to numb every last vital cell in my organism.
I am a massively self-indulgent piece of shit. I used to pretend that my parents didn't care but I was just lying fo myself as usual. I devastate my parents because they love me so much. And here I am wasting under their rooftop, breaking my veins in the process.
It's kind of a catch-22: being a fiend makes me a terrible person, which makes me fiend for more and stronger narcotics to forget that I'm a subhuman creature.
I really feel nonchalant about suicide in terms of how badly I want to die, but I look at being dead as a positive good for my family and I. I doubt I have willpower to turn my life around in order to becomd a successful person I can live with being. Also if I am going to remain a pathetic excuse for a human beinh, at least I have the chemical means to go out blissfully.
I made this to guage how much I disgust people.

"She’s not even my best friend anymore...So this isn’t really one about how I’m depressed, but more about what my best friend did. We were best friends for 14 years. She moved states 3 years ago and never visited. We would always FaceTime, so I thought it was cool, until a few months ago. Out of nowhere, she stopped talking to me. 

I convinced my parents to let us visit her and I finally got to. I’m here finally getting to spend time with her,
but the thing is, she hardly talks to me. She on FaceTime with multiple boys throughout the days, and always texting them when she’s not on FaceTime. She doesn’t spend time with me. 

 (TW: Killing and cutting) What even worse is that I haven’t even told her what’s going on with me. She started panicking because one of her many guy friends told her he had a random thought about killing himself, and she freaked. But I haven’t told her that I’ve tried to kill myself twice already, I’m addicted to cutting myself, and I’ve been diagnosed with depression. I wonder if she would react to what I say or if she would just ignore me, like she has been. 

I haven’t seen her for three fucking years and I went through hell to convince my parents to let me go and visit her. This is what I get. I lost my best friend.",1

"I'm so sick of how society treats people with mental illness. ""Just take these pills and act normal, you idiot!""Our society (the west, I guess) is so fucked up and backwards it's disgusting, no wonder so many of us want to leave this planet.  

Yesterday in the news in England someone committed suicide by stepping in front of a train, and the fucking announcer made a shitty comment over the loud speaker about how the person who died 'couldn't be bothered to live.'

This is why I'm done with this planet.  I'm crippled by depression, anxiety and several other physical problems and you know what? I'm just a burden on the world, and the only person who cares is my husband.  My family doesn't give a shit, my child doesn't give a shit, and everyone hates me because I've had depression and anxiety for 15 years. Just try harder, just take more pills, just be normal,  just make money, just be part of the system, you're nothing, you're a failure, just take more pills that make you worse and cost tons of money.  

I can't even get medication in the country I live in now, and I don't want it anyway, it never fucking helped. All anyone ever does is throw pills at you and then tell you to get over it and be as miserable as everyone else.

I'm writing the letter to my son. I've decided to do it so it looks like an accident, there are ways to make it look like an accident, but I'm still gonna leave a not confirming that it was suicide, just so the police don't get confused.  I only want the police to know it was suicide, my son can find out the truth later.

I can't stand the hatred anymore.  I can't stand knowing that so many people have betrayed me and will betray me again in a heartbeat - because I'm useless and nothing to them.  I'm the lowest of the low. I'm a housewife with crippling depression and anxiety.  My husband deserves so much better. And our life has been so shitty for the last 4 years and it is not getting any better.

shit comes in buckets, not sprinkles.  It's been raining shit for the last 4+ years and I am broken by it.

Two people on the street I grew up on killed themselves.  and I have utter sympathy for both of them. One was a kid with behavioural problems who's parents just treated him like dirt, and another was a single mom with two girls my age.  I'm not mad at her for what she did.  I'm sorry that the world let her down.  She was a nice lady, never brought anything bad on herself. 

I have sympathy for all of them. That fashion designer, even.  she must have felt so alone, like the only thing that made anyone love her was her ""success.""

Well, take it from me, the scum of the earth - the world hates me.   No matter how hard I try, I'm still poor and useless and pathetic. No matter what I do, my son will always hate me and believe his father. He's autistic, he never had much affection for me anyway, and knowing he doesn't love me is a nightmare I can't survive.

His father won.  I'm scum, and I'm going to figure out a way to do it.  I want to wait until things are less stressful at my husband's job, though.  

Life is evil and horrible, and those of us who are mentally ill just see the truth clearer than everyone else. Fuck you I'm sick of your pills and your lies.  

I can't wait to die. I'm gonna do it in a way that it looks like an accident, and my son can find out the truth when he's older.

And fuck it was so wholesome listening to him cus he looked really happy when I asked my dad questions or was interested. I'm so happy for him because I know he struggled with depression and is often overworked like man.... I am really lucky to have parents like that and it makes me so proud of him

"Overwhelmed and LostI have a great wife, amazing friends, supportive family, yadda yadda yadda, but I feel awful regularly. At 29, I've dealt with this for longer than I can remember. Suicidal thoughts, hopelessness, and a general feeling that my world is slowly crashing around me run through my head, and they become self fulfilling. I shut myself away from my patient, caring wife and make her feel lonely and she deserves nothing of what I give her. It feels like I've trapped her in this shit life of mine and she can't get out for fear of me doing something foolish like end it all. I don't have plans, but I constantly think about death. I don't fear it. As some one who thinks about it as often as I do, I almost welcome it. A car crash or crazy fuck with an AK shooting up my place of work sound comforting.   

I've let my depression stop me from being a good person. My wife recently lost some one extremely close to her to cancer and during her grieving period I was distant and closed off. I can be an asshole a lot of the time, but as I look back on how I acted, I feel a sense of shame I have never felt before. I don't want to tell her about my suicidal thoughts, because I don't think she can handle losing some close to her so soon. I refrain from acting on my thoughts because the reality is that the people around me care so much that their lives would be seriously impacted. And I love them all so much that I couldn't do that to them. But I'm afraid that at some point I may reconsider and be selfish old me again. Seeking professional help is confusing, complicated, and downright expensive. 

One of these days I hope to get better. ",1

"I feel so aloneI feel so alone right now. I don't have any friends, my parents are abusive and my sister told me she doesn't care. But lately i've been wanting to change up my style and i wanted to talk to someone about it and about being gay but I didn't have anyone to text and my sisters been really mean.

Life is really hard right now. Its always been but anyways, i'm failing all of my classes, none of it makes any sense. I've been failing every grade since 4th grade and learning if hard. I could barely read until just this year. I'm in my junior year now and nothing is easier.

My mom ignores me, talks over me, tells me im boring and unlovable. My dad doesn't speak to me ever, and my sister tells me im boring and she doesn't care about my shit. I lost my last friend cuz she moved to california and now I have no one.

I've been emotionally abused, neglected and I cant take this anymore. I don't have anyone to talk to and i haven't for years. This isolation is driving me off the edge. I just want to be loved.

I just want someone to stay and care. I'm going crazy and I keep fighting back the urge to swallow all the pills in my house. My cat, she follows me everywhere I go. Sleeps in my bed. Crawls all over me when I cry. I'm scared what might happen to her if I die.

But I cant do this anymore. None of these typed words can describe how ignored and isolated ive felt my whole life. I mean i've been so neglected as a child i didn't feel any connection to my family and believed they were strangers. 

I listen and listen to my sister talk about everything that goes on in her life. Every little problem and all her stupid shit. But she cant listen back for 3 mins?? I give her good advice and i listen when I don't have to and I care so why cant she. Shes all I have and she hates me.

Im so alone. I cant do anything right and im so anxious that i feel like living as an adult is impossible. But my cat. I don't know what to do. I have no one what did i do wrong. 

why cant i be normal. Why cant i do anything right whats wrong with me? what do i do.",1

"It feels like I'm suffocatingI posted this in /r/depression but decided to post it here as well. This might be the worst I've ever felt, and life is starting to look less and less worthwhile. So many times now I've been completely alienated by those around me, and now this is really pushing me over the edge.

I've posted about this a few times but my girlfriend, the only person I've talked to about my depression, broke up with me a couple days ago. Yesterday, to distract myself from my thoughts, I hung out with a buddy and told him about my breakup. We had some beers and got high at his place—which was calming while it lasted. But after falling asleep at his place at around 1:00 AM, I woke up 2 hours later and couldn't get back to sleep. I've always had trouble sleeping, and this recent event has aggravated it. So I left his place at around 6, three hours later, and bussed home. Then I climbed into my own bed, trying to get some more sleep. I fell asleep at 7:45, and had a dream that I was with my ex-girlfriend. We were kissing, even though I was aware of our breakup within the dream, and pretty much knew it was a dream anyway. Then, as I was putting my hands over her body, I woke up again. When I checked the time it was just past 8:00. I was still so tired. And then I started crying again.",1
"I’m done.Life has no redeeming qualities anymore. I’m a recovering meth addict. I’ve been diagnosed with BPD, bipolar 2, major depression, dysthymia, ADHD, and generalized anxiety disorder and probably more that I can’t think of. I know that the suicide statistics for BPD alone are bad, but with everything else I have I feel hopeless. I’ve attempted before, and have a lengthy history of self harm. I’ve never been “happy” that I can remember. The closest I’ve had to happiness recently was a girlfriend I met in my last treatment center, but for no apparent reason she’s not even opening my messages anymore. It’s been three weeks since we last talked. And almost a week since she last sent me a message, or even opened one of mine. I don’t understand why, the last time we talked she said she was going to come see me when she got out. Then she went ghost. I need drugs to help me cope, but I get drug tested where I live now. Without her i have no reason to continue. She was my reason to be better. I just came off of a muddy road, I was flooring my car in hopes I’d crash into a tree and die. Now I’m sitting in my car outside of my room giving myself lighter smileys, I’ve got a pack of razor blades and a bag of pills inside, along with a bottle of liquor in my backseat. My roommate will be gone in a few hours. I could just drown this in alcohol, and maybe I will. But I’d be homeless if I got caught, I almost got kicked out already for relapsing on xanax. I’ll probably delete this, but I’ve got nobody to talk to anymore so I just wanted to get this out.",1

*I had waited for you


Tried detaining my breath


Begged and Waited for you


I only waited for death


Burst out tears time to time


Seemed I'll never forget


Holding thoughts in my rhyme


Fiction found this regret


I had tried letting go


But something confined me down


Must've fixed to my wrists


There was no fixing me now


Please get out of my head


Since you never had shown


How much you've meant to me


Something you should have known




How did this happen to me


I needed something to blame


Was the right time of day


But my train never came


You'd think that I hadn't tried


To forget and move on


I'm still struck in your eyes


You're still stuck in my song


To really hold you instead


Was a thought in my head


Or when the vision's red


Or the hope when I'm dead


It only shackles me now


The Feeling deeper than love.


The Shattered half that I lost



My one and only Jiya.*",0

"documentingJust trying to document this. I don't know.

-Recurring, repeating thoughts of ""i want to die"" and ""kill me"" over and over in my head for months. six months plus. I say these things out loud when I'm alone. google says that this isn't intrusive thoughts any more but suicidal ideation. I am working on a bank reconciliation and thinking I want to die. I am feeding my cat and wanting to die. i am out with friends and want to die. I am driving home from work and want to die. I am making a property repair and want to die. I am beating my fiance at videogames and wanting to die. Always in the back of my mind, kill me kill me kill me kill me.

-I had a plan. I moved house and now my plan wouldn't work. I've tried not to make a new plan.

-No one I've tried to talk to has understood. I think my grandma deliberately misheard when I said I was depressed, and said ""of course you're stressed"". The lady on the suicide line was really dismissive (""why would you want to live in a country that deported you?""). My fiance knows a little and is worried but I don't want to hurt him by telling him everything. Doctor just wants me in and out of her office as fast as possible. Trying to take my meds every day but they're not enough any more. If I told my mom I would just have to support *her* feeling bad about it.

-Sleeping about 4-6 hours a night. Working 40 hours a week at my day job. 20 hours or so at my business. 10 hours on political stuff. Phone with fiance 6-10 hours. More successful than any of my friends. Want to die the whole time.

-showering 3-4 times a week. brushing my teeth maybe every other day. mostly eating free bagels from work, microwave meals, pre packaged smoothies/protein shakes. self care is getting hard.

"It's Friday 13th my birthday, and my life hangs on the bannisterHonestly, I didn't expect to be at this moment, I just didn't. When I first started my suicide plan all the way in November, it was just so far away. Yet, even though I saved up the money and made the plans, it just never felt like it would become.

And now...

&amp;#x200B;

Today's my birthday, 20th birthday I'm spending alone. I'm in the Engineering Department at my university, and I'm pretty high up, right beside the bannister. I spent my birthday how I planned, I ate Chinese, I ate ice cream, dranks sodas. Played Minecraft, Halo 2. All while being alone. But now... It is at 7 pm at night. I'm right where I planned to be. Alone at the Engineering building, beside the bannister. It's an easy jump and a guaranteed death. If I survive, the place is empty enough for me to bleed to death before anyone noticed. It's the perfect opportunity.

&amp;#x200B;

But I don't want to die. More specifically I don't want to be without my girlfriend and I don't want to hurt her. I certainly don't want to experience antagonizing pain, screaming until death. And I haven't even eaten a slice of the birthday cake I brought myself. I don't want to die. Not when I haven't even hugged by girlfriend yet. We promised we'll eventually meet each other to do just that.

&amp;#x200B;

But, something inside me brought me to the bannister when I could have just gone home. It's like an urge that I have to get what I deserve. I'm a complete human failure, no friend, no acquaintances, I hate my family and I have no relationship with them. I try my best with my girlfriend, but she worries about me, and it makes me feel guilty. Admittedly, I don't have anything to live for, other than her.

&amp;#x200B;

So here I am, it's my birthday and I'm spending it on the old hard floor. The bannister is to my right, easy peasy to jump over and just die. No one may notice for some time and it would be over. I just jump and just do what should have been done years ago. I suppose I'm just waiting for the morning, or for the will to die...

A lot of people who suffer choose to suffer because they have faith that if they are patient and good the universe will reward them. The universe rewards no one, it's an indifferent system.

I was feeling like shit last month because I had to pass a bunch of subject to actually finish school, and when I did, I actually felt great, I'd finished and I had no more problems, but now, just a few days later I'm back to feeling like shit for absolutely no reason

It just doesn't get fucking better. I mean when I didn't have a girlfriend I always thought ""Well, when I manage to get a girlfriend I won't feel bad"". Then I got one and nothing changed. Then it was ""I feel bad because I'm stressed out from school, when I finish everything I'll feel better"". But a few days later and I'm back in square one. 

I'm not depressed, I can go about my day normally without even thinking about suicide, but all it takes is a sad song, a sad post, some guy being worse off than I am, some guy being better off than I am or just sitting in bed thinking about my life to make me lie in bed and be sad the rest of the day

"Repost from /r/depression: I'm only 16Yes I'm only a 16 year old guy. But before you start judging me, please just hear me out. I need to vent, but more than that - I need help. 

I'm not even sure this post goes here but I didn't find any other sub- that was even closely related to help me through this.

There are always going to be people with cases worse than mine but they stay strong and I'm just going to that I'm not them. I'm a weak, pathetic, lonely person who can't even decide his own gender. I realized long ago that men sexually appealed to me a lot too but just because of the stigma associated with being bi- or gay, I've never opened up to anyone. I've never even had a real friend in life. There's a ton of people around me everyday but not one of them I can trust. Not one person. The stories that I read about friendship and such, talked how important a friend, how they pull you up, etc. But now when I look at my life - I haven't had one friend like that. Ever. It has got to be me then, right? It isn't possible for everyone in my life, including my parents to push me away in such a manner, unless there is something wrong with me itself, right?

Till a few years ago I was great at school. My grades were high, I was a fantastic lawn tennis player, I even had someone to love. Yes, you'll now go ahead and call this 'just another teenage crush' and nothing more than puppy love. But have you ever felt love so strong for a person that you just know that she's your significant other? Don't say that I'm 16 and I have a life ahead of me and many other girls will come. I know that there won't be anyone else. It was only after her that my life came crashing down. My views on my gender changed, my grades went lower than the Mariana Trench and I started becoming really philosophical. Even today, 2 years after her, I think about her everyday. But you know what I spend more time thinking about? The futility of life. How each one of us tries to pretend that we're supreme and live life like we are the Kings of everything that has existed, everything that exists and everything that shall. And then Death just swoops in and vanquishes us from the face of Earth. How we care about things that have no value at all and how we've deeply we've tumbled into the pits of stupidity. How today, we care more about appearances. And don't give a shit about the real people behind the faces that we see everyday. How emotion has lost all value and something as sacred and spiritual as love is treated as a common plaything. And that's what gets to me. I hate humans. And everything that we stand for today. There was once a time when humans used to strive for excellence, look for new things, discover ourselves. But now? It's all just farce. Money is what drives everything. Looks are what run everything. It just hurts me to see how low the standard of humanity has dropped so low. Kings? We are the Kings of Nothing.

You'll probably be thinking about what my parents think of me now. They are amazing people and I have nothing against them. In fact, they had difficulties worse than mine but they never stopped loving me. But they just aren't capable of thinking emotionally or otherwise to such an extent. They don't understand me anymore and I too have stopped trying to make them understand. Our relationship now is merely like a symbiotic one where I'm living off them for the time-being. Other than my parents too, no one around me respects emotions to such an extent.  Whenever I open up to anyone they just go ahead and say ""Don't take life so seriously"" and ""Just live life and be happy"". I am reminded each time that this happens, how blissful ignorance is.

I've always wanted to be astronaut, you know. In my opinion, there is no other thing that humans can do that is even significant. We were meant to be explorers. Wanderers. Curious travelers. I bet you can't look me in the eye and tell me that we stand for even half of that today. And being an astronaut has always meant doing the work of humanity for me. But then recently, with the futility of life playing through my mind again and again, my love for exploring waned and almost died.

A few months ago, I tried to rid myself of all emotions itself. And the best part is that I've been successful to a great extent too. Today, at this very moment, if half the people I know are to die - it won't affect me. Yes, it'll be a pity that some of them had to go so soon. But it won't hurt me anymore, you know. That's who I am today. I've made myself like this because I know that they would feel the same if I were to go. I don't matter, ergo, they don't either.

Today I had an outburst which is what made me decide that I needed to talk to someone. We had to prepare a speech and the topic I chose was friendship. We had to talk about true friendship with reference to the Merchant of Venice. I didn't have much time and I didn't take the assignment too seriously and ended up scouring the internet at 2am for a paragraph on true friendship and then one on the emotion of friendship in the play. I wanted to write a speech myself but had to just go ahead with the internet one simply because I didn't have enough time. And you know what? I fucking hated what I was going to say. Why? Because I didn't agree with even one sentence of what I was about to say. I don't even believe in true friendship. It's just a figment of our imagination, an ideal that we can only strive to achieve but never even come close to. And something snapped in me three sentences into the speech. I suddenly said ""You know what? True friendship? It's non-existent"". I went on to say how people had quantified real friendship as being gay. How people had ripped out emotions completely from their lives. It ended up being more creepy and weird than thought-provoking. It wasn't what I wanted to tell everyone. But it was close. This ended up spreading like wildfire, and everyone thinks I'm a weirdo now. But if you've properly read this post - it should be kind of obvious. It doesn't matter to me what other people think of me. I'm beyond that.

I've reached a point where my grades are insignificant for me. In fact, there is nothing that I find myself aiming for. Nothing I find myself hoping for.

"I’m scared to live and I’m scared to diei... don’t know where to start but i’m Basically my family's servant. They expect me to do things no one else in the family does, on top of performing extreme emotional labor and pseudo marriage counseling on a daily basis.

 I get told I’m not allowed to cry and I’ve been beat or belittled for showing any emotions, but I have to listen to my parent’s suicidal ideation and try to coax them out of it. When I am my mom told me to go ahead and do it. In fact when I was three I kept telling my mom “I Love you!!!” Over and over bc i thought it was fun and she told me I was being annoying haha.... she beat me every day until i was big enough to hit her back around age 14....

They’ve never shown interest in me or what I like. They expect me to be grateful for food and shelter, and I am but.... I wish once in my life I would get a hug and an I love you. I know that’s sad coming from a 19-soon-to-be-20 year old but they’ve never shown me affection and it really hurts. Its not like I can get it elsewhere, they’ve kept me socially isolated my entire life. I have a 6th grade education. And before that I taught myself for 3rd and fourth.

 I’ve never really had friends, online or off. I know its kind of sick but I fantasize about being more well off stable and a successful writer, artist and musician and my favorite musicians and writers and artists being friends with me because it helps numb the pain to pretend there’s someone there even if they aren’t really.... because being alone is literally the worst feeling in the world... [also i know this is a run off sentence and I’m sorry most of these are I don’t Want to keep going over this post.... my writing is way better than this sorry I’m just really upset]

 My parents were/are drug addicts and I had to sell all my gaming systems and expensive electronics. I don’t know how to escape any of this without going to a shelter and I’d rather take all my dad’s blood pressure pills and go into a stroke. I just want to be happy for once. No one has ever loved me, and I mean that. My extended family tells me how much of a burden I am too. I'm numb now to everything. 

All i do everyday is listen to sad songs and watch anime buzzfeed unsolved or speedpaints. I draw but I’m nowhere near where i want to be. I call myself a writer but i never write...I want to learn music but i cant even afford a used guitar....

 I just want this to be over but I still have a sliver of hope that someone will save me, or I can find some way to save myself. The worst part is I’m trans and gnc and in the closet and my mom tells me every day how trans people and ESPECIALLY GNC people are the cause of the worlds problems and we’re a sign of end times. I don’t want to be. I just want to be loved. Not even in a clingy way, I just want someone to take an interest in me and be happy i;m alive... it hurts a lot to keep breathing and i want the pain to stop but mostly i just want to be ok
Like i said the void scares me but so does never getting out......
Sorry for this and sorry in general. I feel like I’m manipulating everyone....haha....",1

"I can't take the pain anymoreI've been struggling with major depressive disorder since I was about 13. Maybe before. My eldest sister physically abused my middle sister and I; my parents did nothing. They were stressed and focused on their own little things. I was overweight and bullied for various reasons throughout my academic career from k-12.

The depression was really bad at 15. I wanted to see a therapist, but my mom didn't believe in therapy. She refused to see what was right in front of her. My middle sister had to convince her something was wrong. The ""therapist"" was my mom's best friend... yeah...

Anywayz, college was the best years of my life. Made friends, lost mad weight, got hot, found a life philosophy I could subscribe too. Did well in school, decided to go to grad school.

Grad school isn't working out well for me, the career path I chose isn't right. Every time I try to talk to my parents about it, they refuse to hear that this isn't right for me. I've thought about suicide on and off since I was a kid. Today, I just feel worthless, helpless, and low. Sorry the prose in this isn't more beautiful or detailed. I was suppose to have my therapy appt today. my therapist's office is in a few cities over. That's usually ok, since my business off (23F here) is in the same city, a 5 minute walk away from my office, but a long drive from my apt.. I couldn't sleep last night and I felt uber-tired when I ""woke up"". As I walked out the door, the office secretary called to tell me all my appointments were cancelled. I decided I could move my paperwork to tomorrow... I've been feeling anxious, depressed, and the lack of sleep has not been helping. I did what I thought was best for me... usually sleeping, at this stage of my life, when I'm anxious and/or depressed is like a spoon full of sugar. I cancelled my therapy appt and laid down.

I woke up, sometimes after my appt, and still felt like shit. I called my parents, who were basically like... ""Well... I don't know what to tell you..."" that was my dad at least. I called my best friend from college, and a whole slew of people who were busy. 

I don't like talking to my problems with my parents, as they see it their way or the highway. I called my therapist multiple times saying I made a mistake in missing and can you PLEASE reschedule with me, I need to talk. I tried talking to my parents, but all I got was shouted at for dare suggesting something that they wouldn't want for me (in regards to my grad school issues). When I tried to talk to them how I felt depressed and anxious, they stated that I need to get over it and stop crying.

Luckily, my therapist said he'd call at 9:30 tonight... maybe we can talk on the phone for 15 minutes.

Why not suicide though? Not because my external life is going to crap... that happens. I mean because of the pyschological pain my family constantly puts me through. So what if I die? Idk y, I honestly don't buy that they won't get over it, especially after the way I was treated tonight. My life will never be ""right""... I'll never not be depressed... I'll always be anxious. My outside life, though it has it's ups and downs, is overall fine. It's this inner-torture I can't take anymore. Why not suicide? Cause it's illegal? Cause it'll hurt my family? well they certainly give a damn enough about me...

The only real reasons I can think of not doing that is because 1) it may not work and I don't wanna be fucked up for life. Nowadays, more or less, I have an overall healthy body and I enjoy having a healthy body. 2) My roommate is the sweetest person in the world * she's away on a business trip right now*, I don't wanna have her have to deal with my corpse. 

I think I may delete all the numbers out of my cell phone book. Why? They don't give a damn... My parents would figure I'm being ""emotional"" again and that's the reason I'm not talking to them. My roommate likes clean things, maybe I should clean up my room for her.

My therapist is suppose to call in 2 hours. I wanna tell him how I feel but I don't wanna be 5150'ed. What would be the point of that? If I decide not to it'll just fuck up my school work and office work. Will the 5150 take away my pain? No...

I'm just tired of this pain.

I'm going to try to do little things to distract myself until my therapist calls...

**EDIT: I feel a little better since writing this out... maybe something in me wants to live. I'm going to do little things...**

**EDIT 2: Just eating some dinner and feeling revitalized =)... still wondering if it's worth it and thinking of asking my therapist if I should go on antidepressants...**

**Edit 3: Just checked facebook and found out this guy I liked blocked me... super... sent him a txt saying ""Hey, see you blocked me on facebook. I hope you have a nice life."" feel really low again...**

**EDIT 4: feel that depressive sleep coming on...**

**EDIT 5: My therapist called last night. He didn't 5150 me but he wants to check in with me tomorrow. My girlfriend in the city I live in called around 11PM, we had a long chat and she made me feel better. She stayed on until she knew I was ok and she told me not to traumatize my roommate by letting her find my dead body and that she'd honestly miss me and be upset. Another friend from college called super early in the morning. I picked up the phone and said I'd call him back. It's 9:17 now, I'll call and leave a message. I guess I'm going to make it...**",1

"I'm sad.So, earlier this week I wanted to die. I REALLY wanted to die. People tried to talk me down but it ended up not working. The day after, I felt well enough to finally confess to my crush but I got rejected because he was already with someone. It crushed me. I was only staying alive this long because I thought I had a chance. Somewhere in my mind, I really, actually thought I had a chance. I'm stupid. This wasn't the first time this has happened. I keep falling in love with people 100 times better than me and then get hurt by the inevitable rejection. It's happened my entire life. I've never really been with someone. I ran from my family to get away from an abusive household when I was 18 so there's no comfort there, and nobody ever wants to be near me. There's no future for me, so I'm going to make a note for whoever find my body in the car in my garage and do it. I'm sorry that I'm letting everyone here down but, you guys are just the last in a long chain of disappointed friends and family. Goodbye.",1

I’ve seen many attractive girls but never loved someone like a loved her, I would have done anything in the world for her I loved her that much. I dreamed every night spending the rest of my life with her.. but she cheated on me with one of my best friends. I fell into a deep depression after that and started failing school, then this COVID happened and I’ve been numb ever since. I really don’t wanna spend more time in this earth I know there is nobody out there for me.. she was like my soulmate the only girl I felt a real connection with I still can’t believe she fucking cheated on me i would have rather never met her because of the pain she made me endure.

"Starting to think I should just set up a shop here.What is this now? The 5th time I've been here? 7th? Lost count.

It largely hasn't gone well. Hit a dip, start to question the point of my continued existence in the face of endless suffering, and get patronized, or accused of being selfish, or - one of my favorites - browbeaten while hiding behind the guise of being ""helpful"". That pretty well sums up how one human being sees the worth of another.

That's the thing though. We're all wrapped up in our own little worlds, our own problems. Why exactly do my problems matter? They don't. To any other person, they are background noise, a mark on the sheet that notes a person being alive, and little else. No one really stops to think, ""My life is a rich tapestry of experiences, feelings, and relationships. So is that person."" More often, the other person is just rolled into their narrative.

I'm not exempt from this, obviously. This tangent pretty well shows that. Being aware of it only heightens the irony.

"I don't fit in anywhere and I just want to leaveBurner account. 

I've always felt like this. Ever since I was a kid, I just wanted to observe or be old and casually watch people have fun. When we played ball, I always was someone who preferred to watch and cheer others on. 

When I worked as a grocery store bagger, I enjoyed it to an extent because I just kinda glided through the store and observing shoppers. 

Freshman year of college was painful. New city, new people. I just couldn't connect with people (although it's a bit easier now since everyone is desperate for human connection). 

Even when I'm with super good friends, at the end of a hangout I always feel empty. Like there's something missing. Even if we talk about deep topics and bond about life, at the end I just feel so removed from the situation and I don't know why. Like an observer of the situation. 

Hobbies I love, I can get along w people a lot easier but at the end there's a wall somehow. 

Somehow I just don't know anymore. I've wanted to leave earth and just observe it from above ever since I was young (but it really hit high school). 

I can't shake it. I wish I could just be a spirit flying around through the air doing my thing. I don't want to be here, even if some memories were good. 

I know the whole points 
""Life is meaningless, but that means it's endless""
""It takes time to outgrow bad habits"" 
""You'll find groups of people that love you for you"". 

I know life is sick and disgusting but full of wonder and beauty. I know I have to keep fighting. I had to pull myself away from multiple suicide attempts earlier this year. I know I should try to live in the moment and enjoy life. 

But somehow the feeling always comes back. I just want to leave and gaze at the world. 

I have interests and hobbies and goals but at the end of the day it all just seems worthless. I guess that's the beauty of life but I can't help it.

"My boyfriend killed himself three months agoWe were planning to do it together, up until the last few days. I chickened out. He didn't. The second I decided not to, I absolutely knew I would always regret it. And I really, really do. 
I had already had the person who was basically the love of my life, who I was with for about five years, die a little over a year ago of an overdose. I have been struggling hardcore with depression for years, and these deaths of people I deeply love are adding up. 
I don't believe in an afterlife, but I want so badly to believe that I will see them again. Even if I don't...I'm so tired of being in this world. It's not at all fair that they left me here alone. I'm so tired. Of being sad, and lonely, and feeling like there is absolutely no purpose to my existence. I really don't want to exist anymore.",1

I have so much to be grateful for but I just hate myself and can't seem to see beyond my depression, and anymore I feel like my mind is a prison. I feel like I'm trapped in a body that isn't mine and I just can't believe what I have become.

"No job, no friends, and family that sees me as a disappointment.I know these type of posts are seen all the time so I don’t expect a lot of interaction with mine. I just need a place to vent since I really have no one else to go to. I’ve felt like a loner for years now but I’m at my absolute lowest at the moment. The one companion of mine that I had for almost 8 years, my dog, passed away last month. I always said I wouldn’t kill myself as long as he was here with me and now that he’s gone I see no other reason to keep going. I graduated from college this past December and haven’t been able to land a job since. Most days I just sit and play video games because I just get so angry at all the rejection from employers who say they’re hiring for entry level but require 2+ years of experience. I don’t have any skills. I tried to learn programming but honestly I’m just not very tech savy and I just don’t have enough time to learn before my situation gets worse. I feel like I’ve let my family down, especially my grandma and mom who sacrificed so much to get me to college. Killing myself would just be doing them a favor. At least I would no longer be a burden. The people I thought were my friends grew up and got lives and just abandoned me in the process. Only things that seems to keep me somewhat happy are sex and alcohol. I don’t see myself being the type of person to commit suicide by hanging or an overdose but honestly if the rampant sex with strangers won’t kill me, the alcohol poisoning sure will. 🙃",1

"I feel like I don't deserve to kill myself, but I still want to.All in all, my life, from an outsiders perspective, is extremely good. I am 16, have a house, food, parents who are still in love, I go to a top of the notch public school, and I am in good physical condition. 

But I still do not feel that my life is worth continuing. I am ashamed of myself for not completing two separate items in different classes. I have a tiny circle of friends, most of whom I think don't truly like me. I have an ugly, unlovable face, no artistic talent to speak of, I am unorganized, lazy, messy and annoying. I have been bullied through middle school, moved countries for high school. My grandmother died today, and I don't feel sad *in the slightest*, which makes me think that I am a selfish, stupid girl who is inconsiderate of others.

But all of these reasons don't sound good enough for me to kill myself. But I still hate myself at my core. I'll never be good enough, or wanted, or happy. I cannot see myself becoming a productive member of society. I can never see myself achieving my dream of having done something notable. So what is the point of living?",1

"Trying to find another reason to liveHello everyone.  

I want to start off by complimenting all the angels who troll this forum, spewing support and advice all over the place like a cat that ate too much Fancy Feast™.  I also want to say, to any who have been crying into their cheerios so often they don't bother using milk anymore, that there is always hope.

There are two kinds of suicidal people, far as I can tell: those who became suicidal because they feel sad, and those who feel sad because they became suicidal.  I am the latter.

I have been betrayed in horrible ways by those closest to me all my life.  Family, friends, girlfriends, etc.  Ways so heinous, so undeniably evil, that I cut them off with an ultimate quickness and found new friends/girlfriends, etc (obviously not family).  Then it happened again, in a different way.  Cut 'em off, move on, new friends, lather, rinse, repeat.  

Basically, my mother is the only person I care about and I don't want to hurt her with my suicide.  But I am SO tired of living.  My job is not exactly legal, but I am DAMN good at it.  I have spent the last 11 years building an empire that has supported me, paid my rent, even sent me back to school.  I have met thousands of people from all different walks of life, took walks on the wild side, dabbled on the dark side, traveled, changed lives, talked people out of suicide, helped people in need, had relationships with dozens upon dozens of beautiful and wonderful women, been in car chases, had near-death experiences, learned new languages, taken down heroin dealers, founded a gang, built a flamethrower, and many, many other crazy awesome things; long story short I've lived more in my 30 years on this planet than most people get to all their lives.  And for all this, no criminal record. No joke.

I threw away society and legality when I got screwed over by ""good"" people (""legal"" does not mean ""moral"").  I decided if the world was going to screw me over, I was going to become a monster.  And I did.  I became one of the most infamous and feared dealers in my neck of the woods.  With the fear and money came respect and power.  Because I didn't go down this path till after high school and a bit of college, I was a highly-educated, strategic, business-oriented, healthy (never did drugs, didn't smoke weed till I was 23) martial artist.  It was easy to rip the market out of the hands of the ones who used to be in charge.  Don't worry, I'm the good kind of darksider; I never hurt anyone I didn't have to unless to defend myself or my property.

Well, here's the problem.  I spent so long in the game that it's not only what I'm best at, but it's all anyone will trust me to do.

I tried to finish college, but after wasting tens of thousands of dollars and changing my degree literally five times (Computer Science -&gt; Business admin -&gt; music theory -&gt; Business Law -&gt; Chemical engineering), I got sick of paying to jump through hoops just to prove I could to a bunch of clucks and then ultimately finding myself disinterested, so I just stuck with my incredibly lucrative activities.  Well, part of staying out of trouble is having a day job, and I finally got a company to offer me an engineering job without having a degree, but the insurance company made it far too expensive to ensure the work I'd be doing (even though all those assholes at the company walked into their jobs without a degree straight out of high school and the head of engineering wanted to hire me).

Around this time, I contracted HIV.  Suddenly, even those I had remained friends with for 20+ years decided I wasn't worth anything anymore and betrayed me in various ways and started treating me like a leper.  Of course, going to war with me was stupid and they essentially exiled themselves from our town when they decided to make me their enemy.  But nonetheless, lost all my friends again because people are shit.

Dating isn't so easy anymore.  People sabotage my relationships with their ignorance (I am undetectable and cannot spread the disease), as if I would give some poor gal a death sentence just so I could sleep with her.  I had even found someone, and 4 months in, when we were thinking about telling her family about my diagnosis (Yes, of course she knew, I *told* her before we slept together, as with every partner), my best friend in the world went and told my girlfriend's family before we had a chance to, saying things like ""She will DIE"".  It caused so much stress and tension between us it ruined our relationship because the family wanted me gone all of a sudden. My friend even did it to me again 9 months later, keeping tabs on me so he could sabotage whatever he felt like.  Why did he or any of my other ""friends"" decide this was ok to do? I have NO F*CKING CLUE.  He also is exiled, though, so if he's reading this I just wanna say good job, moron, I better never see you again.

My family was destroyed as well (not by my diagnosis, something completely different), hence why it's just my mother and I.

So, college isn't for me.  Apparently the American workforce isn't for me either.  Family?  Nope, don't get one.  Love, (my goal in life) isn't for me either (I've already fallen in love twice, doubt it will happen again anyway).  

Basically all I do now is run the remnants of my empire, play video games, drink, and waste away.  

I'm tired.  I'm tired of trusting people just to get screwed, I'm tired of having to defend myself from rumormongers and false friends, I'm tired of everything.  All the things I cared about or wanted I cannot have.  The things in this life that made it seem worthwhile are no longer feasible, and every day I get a little older and further away from my prime.  I'm not even sure I'm capable of falling in love anymore, or trusting another human being.  If I don't continue down my ""career path"" (hahaha) then my last 11 years of experience in the game are for naught and I have to start over at entry-level doing some bullshit job for the man, or try school AGAIN.  But blah blah blah, the candle that burns twice as bright, whatever.  I've lived PLENTY of life.  TONS of life.  I might even have an admirer or two out of the people that have read my little novel here.

I'm not here for anyone's ""all life is sacred"" garbage rhetoric (it's not, good luck dealing with overpopulation with that logic, btw), I'm not here for a phone number to your best psychiatrist, or to get your sister's email address because ""you swear she's a sweet gal and we'd get along"".  I view life as such: ""There is no good, there is no bad, things just are.""

I'm here because if I disappear (jail, murder, suicide, doesn't matter), my mother would be devastated.  

She has tried so hard to create a life for us and to be as much of a family to me as she can.  She did everything she could to help me get healthy again, she held my hand growing up, she is EVERYTHING someone could have asked for in a mother.  She does hundreds of things for me, both small and big.  She is my LAST reason to live.  When I first decided I was going into a line of work that could take my life or imprison me, I made a promise to protect her son (me) at ALL costs, and have gone to great lengths to ensure my survival no matter what dangers I might come across, and even greater lengths to make sure I don't get locked up, either.  

But now it's getting hard to keep my promise.  Life is so BORING now.  Everyday is a reminder of what garbage most people are.  I don't think it's in my future to get married.  I am too late to change my career.  I'll ice myself after she passes away, but until then I need to be strong and find another reason to live.  She's no idiot, she knows about my job, my diagnosis, my belief that the rest of my life is hardly worth the time compared to my last thirty years, etc.  But, I don't want her to spend the rest of her life with what I can only imagine would be an unbearable pain that her son feels this way.

Please.  I need to find another reason to live.  So that I can at least appear happy, because these days that's nearly impossible for me.  Help me do this for her.

Anyway.... thanks for reading, I know it was a lot.  And I hope, in some weird way, the responses here, or even my story, help those of you out there who have absolutely *no* business contemplating suicide.

With love,
Your friendly neighborhood Dingo",1
"They want gender equality Sorry if this offends you I need to say this.


Can we please take a minute to realise that there is nearly nothing on sexism towards men. It is always protecting women saying men are sexist and all that. Yeah we are sometimes but it goes both ways.
Even after the Jonny Depp situation nothing changed it is just infuriating that nothing is said.

"please help ASAP This post is more about my mom than me; I've had thoughts but would never go through with it.

Recently my mom found out about my dad having an affair with a prostitute, this has exacerbated marital problems that they already had.  They constantly fight at night and I end up in the middle, but because of school my mom always tells me to just go to sleep- but how am I supposed to sleep while this is going on?  

Anyway, my mom left the house after one of the arguments got particularly bad, and after yelling at me and my sister accusing us of siding with our dad.  (Admittedly, we're a little selfish in that we both want our mom to take him back so things can go back to normal, but there's certainly no bias.)  She called my dad and threatened suicide a couple of times before hanging up.  She certainly has been going through a lot, even besides this particular situation, and she's talked about suicide before.

I can't reach her at all, and I'm worried about her...but I I do finally get to her or somehow get ahold of someone who can help she'll just be upset with me for still being awake at what is now nearly half past four in the morning.  What can I do to make sure she's okay?",1

"It's overI am tired of living. My life has been shit since I was a child losing my parents when I was 5 then living with family who kept me in the crawl space and beat me daily. After 18 I was away from them and things seemed to be getting better but the depression was always there and still nightmares of the past. Everyone on the outside had no clue what I been through or that I was down. I faked being happy almost my whole life. Now I'm 27 and tired of it. Always was living paycheck to paycheck until I was about 24 and started making good money and had over 30k in the bank which was satisfying to me and in the best spot of my life. But then life happened again and with no family I was staying in hotels for nearly half a year straight the past year and blew through all my savings. Back to being as broke as I was before all the depression just came back and hit me hard. I feel lifeless like nothing in my life matters. I have to pay 700 in rent at the end of the month and have no way to pay it. Told my roommate I would pay 500 but have no way of even doing that. Basically a situating where I will be out on the street and I feel the sense of urgency beating on me strong.  I literally have no family or friends to help me. The thing is I helped people a lot when I had money and was doing good and those so called friends disappeared when the money was running out. Last friend I thought I had a few weeks ago blocked me and disappeared after helping with 500 he needed. I only had 1000 to my name and thought he would pay back but nope blocked me right after that and was gone. I feel like an idiot and really don't wanna go on with this kind of stress any longer. I'm too embarrassed at this point to tell my roommate I can't come up with the money since I was already warned I would have to leave if I didn't have it, so I think I will off myself sometime before May. I know it sounds petty but the thought of failing anymore and even saying I don't have the money makes me want to die. Call me weak minded but I been through so much in my life I feel like I lived forever. Guess I just wanted someone to know my story.",1

"I am not cut out for this worldI dont know where else to go. I thought I was doing so well. I have been seeing a therapist and taking Zoloft, but it doesn't seem to have worked. I recently got a very easy job while in school, but I just do not feel like I can do it.

I have terrible which in turn, causes my depression. Yesterday, not only was I called out in my class for ding something stupid, but right after class I was screamed at someone my friend buys weed from for being a fucking idiot. He's right.

I know I am an idiot. It doesn't bring me any peace knowing I am not the only one dealing with these issues because I still feel like shit. Yesterday night I wrote a suicide note and grabbed a knife to slit my wrist, but I couldn't do it. I was sobbing the whole time. Knowing I have a way out if life becomes too much to handle comforts me. I think it has finally become too hard.

I don't know why I was born like this. I don't know why I'm still alive.

"Very LonelyHey everyone. I'm not sure why I'm writing this. I guess I just wanted to reach out to someone since I don't actually have anyone.

I'm a 26 year old gay male who feels extraordinarily lonely. For some reason, making friends is extremely difficult for me. And I know the perpetual mental state I'm in now only harms my chances. But I feel like I make genuine efforts to engage with people, where in kind it feels like people make genuine efforts to disengage me. Being best friends with myself has become really stale and I've ran out of ways to distract my thoughts. I understand some people enjoy their own company, but I particularly prefer to be social.

I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong. I don't actually go through my day trying to read human relationships with a perfect blueprint, but I can't help but wonder why my coworkers won't even invite me to golf or game night, for example. I'm amazingly well at keeping thoughts like these private (and I often don't have a choice) so I feel like I'm just like any other chill dude ready to have a good time. I don't feel like I'm desperate or overwhelming people by asking for more out of them than they can give.

I reach out to people.. ask them to see a movie.. go for a hike.. but it never happens. Why doesn't a person ever reach out to me for a movie? Man, I am really trying to imagine how another person feels when someone thinks of them to be their choice of fun. I really hope no one takes that for granted. Anyways, I'm really starting to ramble, and I guess my point is that I feel like I've been as sincere and patient as possible, and don't really understand what else to do.

I am in serious emotional pain lately, particularly knowing I have no one to lean on when feeling this way, so it's just an impossible feedback loop. I think often of suicide, because my life just feels like I'm drifting without any purpose or reason to go through the next day. My job is ridiculously stressful and I have no real way to relieve that stress. And now I'm becoming a cynical person who doesn't really feel interested in trying to make things work anymore. And because of this I become more lonely because the forced social contact I created by talking to people, now withdrawn, has literally left me chronically untouched for the past month.

Thanks for reading.. sorry for the negative energy.",1
"Suicidal girlfriend. Need adviceHi there, and thanks for clicking on my post. I'll try to make this as short as possible. First of all, I am not suicidal and I do not need any help. It is my girlfriend who has recently been very suicidal and is in need of the help. She doesn't go on reddit or anything so I figured I'd post here to get some advice for her.
 




We live in different cities, approximately 6 hours apart, and sometimes due to outside factors I am unable to drive over and visit her. Anyways, she has been increasingly moody and depressed for the past few weeks. (She has always been, but never as much as now.) Basically, she says some things that contribute to her misery are her loneliness, as well as recent arguments with me. I ask her to expand on those issues so that I may offer her advice or look for a solution, but she refuses to talk and just threatens to kill herself. Sometimes she says she even does it just to have my attention, which she has ALL the time, anyways. Obviously this worries me a lot since I cannot be there with her at this time, so I do my best to care for her from a distance.





Last night she tried to OD on I have no idea what kind of meds. I did my best to talk some sense into her but she just ignored me. She woke up and threw up, feeling really sick, however now she says it is not so bad anymore. Even now I am talking to her about it, and I keep urging her to see a doctor and a therapist, but she declines all form of help I offer her, with no reasoning or explanation; just a simple ""no."" When I keep talking to her, she says I'm too insensitive to her problems... Which does not make sense to me at all because I am extremely stressed over this and worrying constantly, doing my best to help her. This is where I need your help, Reddit. I have no idea what I can do for her from such a distance. She won't listen to reason and instead constantly wallows in her own misery. She refuses any help or advice I offer her as well. What can I do? I figured I could contact her cousin who lives near her to maybe help out, but I was thinking I'd save that for a bit later, probably after I get some advice over here. (My girlfriend is alright for the time being.)





I love her very much, Reddit. I want to help her so bad, but I need some advice on how I can communicate to her some form of advice... Something she will consider and understand. Or anything I can do that would prove effective in helping her.",1
Nobody cares about me 🥺I just feel like if I died tonight then people will forget about me. I’m so useless. I really don’t want to do this anymore. I feel like dying.,1
"I just need someone to hear my story...I’ve been having suicidal thoughts for a long time. They started when I was 13 and I was raped by my big brother. It happened a few times before I got the courage to tell my parents. I thought that would help, but it didn’t. They did nothing, but I don’t blame them. I wouldn’t know what to do if my son raped my daughter. I don’t know if they ever talked to him, but I know they never talked to me about it. Never asked how I felt, never took me to a see a psychologist or anything. It was like it never happened. One time my mom found me crying so bad and she asked what was wrong, I told her I wasn’t comfortable been near my brother and all she said was “if it hasn’t happened again you should just let it go”. Yeah, like it’s that simple. I was forced to live with my rapist and pretend like it never happened while everyone else continued living our “perfect life , with our perfect family”.  Sometimes I just stopped talking to everyone and my parents said I should stop being so rude and “be a part of this family”.
My younger brother knows nothing about this, and he asks me why I am the way I am (distant, rude, indifferent) with my older brother (he admires his big brother so much). But I can’t tell him the truth, it will break his heart. 
Sometimes I want to talk to my parents and brother and tell them they should be ashamed of what they did. My parents for ignoring the problem, not giving me a hand in my healing process, not being able to protect their little girl from a monster they raised. To my brother I wish I could say “go fuck your self “, but I’m a coward and I just can’t do it. I don’t really blame them, it’s a weird/difficult thing that happened I’m sure no one can handle the right way.

But I just wish I could help myself, I can’t stop feeling insecure, worthless. I know no one except me can drag me out of this dark place I’m in, but I have no strength. I’ve tried talking to people, friends, boyfriend, shrinks, but no one really understands my pain. They just give me a sad look feeling sorry for me, but there’s not much they can do. My best friend says I’m so brave for going through this all by myself, and still be able to greet everyone with a smile, treat people nicely, be supportive when friends need it. She says I’m a loving person, always going the extra mile when it comes to helping others, always doing whatever I can to put a smile on someone else’s face. You could say I’m a really kind person, and I know it’s true, but i just wished this helped me put a REAL smile on my face. 
I’m tired of pretending I’m happy. Getting out of bed every morning asking God why I’m still alive. I’m tired of thinking about driving my car off the road on purpose, tired of crying my self to sleep every night, tired of feeling like shit knowing no one really understands what I’m feeling and specially tired of not knowing how to help myself heal. 
I need healing and I need it so bad. I’m afraid one day I will give up. I don’t want to, but there’s not much strength left in me.
 I want to kill myself, but I’m a coward. I can’t do it and leave all the people I care about deal with that pain. I can’t let them feel that they could have done more. I can’t hurt them, I don’t wanna cause them pain.
That’s the only reason I’m still alive. I would rather let pain kill me that inflict it on some one else. I guess I know what it feels like to be broken and I would never wish that on anyone.

I’ve never said this to anyone, but writing it makes feel a bit better. I know this will only last a few minutes, but it feels good to let it all out.",1

"I'm dreading college graduationCollege graduation is just around the corner. Yet I dread graduating because I still have not locked down an engineering job. I grew up in a small town that doesn't have a ton of opportunity, and thus it would be hard to ""network"" or make new friends who could help me land something. People tell me to not worry I have experience but it isn't enough. Everyone these days has had at least one summer internship. A friend of mine told me a friend of his may get me an interview for a position starting January but that isn't a guarentee. I have a bad habit of not keeping in touch. 

I just turned 27 a month ago and if getting a real career at 27 isn't bad enough already I can't imagine how pathetic it would be to not start a career until 28 or 30. There is nothing positive about being a late bloomer, it's  just another word for loser.

With girls it's even worse. Most people my age or younger are already in serious relationships and about to get married. I only had 1 girlfriend in my life so I have no where near enough experience for a wife. 

""Everyone moves at their own pace"" was something my mom always said. Yet the guys who move faster get better everything and are liked more by everyone. 

I don't want to marry a former slut who had sex with more than 10 guys. Yet the only girls over 25 who arent sluts are either in serious relationships or fat. I don't want the table scraps of early bloomers. 

I decided if I don't get a job 2 months after graduation I'm going end my life. It will hurt my parents but 10 years from now they will forget I even existed. ",1

"I flunked out of college and my mother sabotages my social life. I feel hopeless.I couldn't stay focused long enough to complete my assignments and the university I went to lacks support services, so my parents decided to stop paying for me to go to college. Since then, I've applied to jobs at every store, every fast food place, every Starbucks, every restaraunt, every mall, etc. but haven't had any luck. My friends are too ""busy"" to spend any time with me. I started have some luck talking to some girls at Starbucks, but my mom suddenly showed up, told me to get in her car to ""talk to her,"" and then drove me home. I Ubered back to Starbucks, but the girls I was talking to were gone. I feel so hopeless.

"Rarely ever feel happy &amp; afraid to get help,I'm just tiredSo tonight has not felt very good. I shouldn't have a reason to even been feeling this way considering that the stress I feel right now is so minor I shouldn't even be discussing it. I feel like my behavior is bothering others and has been for a while dispite whether or not they tell me it's fine. I don't feel like it's fine. I have felt off since June of 2018 when my emotions just spilled out and I never regained my old self. Instead a newer person emerged and has taken over. Compete with a new mindset that tells me I need to die. And I believe it. I've self harmed very little,but haven't done that in a long time because I just don't have the energy for it. Minor problems and even just the thought or discussion of my future such as looking for a job or studying for a drivers permit/taking the test just drives me away further. Fuck social anxiety. If I don't get my shit together soon,I have no other choice but to at least try and leave. It's to a point where if I even see anybody look like they are enjoying themselves I just think to myself ""where did I go wrong?"" ""Why do I feel this way"" ""why can't I join them?"" Because I don't work hard enough and I'm lazy as fuck.I don't know how it got this bad to where I feel the only way to ever feel satisfied and not annoyed or just exhausted and broken feeling is to die. I always think of negative scenarios where my life is in danger,because if I feel this way all the time then why not life dangerously? I just hope someone reads this and understands. Also I haven't reached out for help from a therapist or called/texted any hotlines because I'm scared of the outcome. I feel like it will go wrong. I'm just wasting my time here. ",1

"HSP, Depression and Aspergers*Chapter 1: The Beginnings* 

When I was a child I was easily overwhelmed by sensory perception. For my parents this was slightly difficult, I mean, what to do with a child, that is sick almost every second day and doesn't want to play soccer with others or anything. However, as I got older I got used to it, knew how to handle it. Now the overwhelming of my senses is no problem anymore but I struggle another side effect of HSP. To be honest, I experience feelings and emotions more or, to be more precisly, in another way than others. All my life, people never understood me. Never knew why I felt so sad and depressed. Today it's still the same, I talked to my peers and comrades a lot about my problems and way of perceiving stuff, they however never understood it, talked to me like I have a chance of controlling it. ""Ignore it and focus on yourself"" - gotta vomit if I have to hear that type of shit ever again. 

But what bugs me off so much you may ask? Well, it is a long story, you don't know me so I try to bring it in a short way. 

*Chapter 2: Isolation and loneliness*

I never got loved my whole life. It's not that my parents were the worst but they still never truly understood me, especially my father. Ever since I hit puberty or so I had that enormous urge for interhuman closeness because I never had that my life. I can't even explain it properly, I'm sorry, but it hasn't to do with sex or something, I don't care about that at all. All I need is like... warmness, hugs, a girlfriend - that type of stuff. But sadly, all my approaches to girls, I thought were not hoes or bitches but rather friendly and loving humans, went a bad way. Everyone, as soon as I got slightly closer to them, treated me a bad way. Ignoring. Rejecting. Those things. One important thing is, I only approached girls when I already developed feelings for them, so it wasn't a huge amount of girls but you see, I am old and grown up now, over the years it wasn't just one, even though I was always stuck with one for a long time.

*Chapter 3: Therapy &amp; Medication*

I could never explain why me? Why I am destined for chronic isolation and loneliness. You see, the first years of rejection weren't that bad. I mean, it happens, but as I got older, and it never changed, like an endless cycle, those add up to a mixture of major depression. I went to see psychiatrists, therapy, even medication. Nothing helped me. I tried like 6 different antidepressants, none with success, my doctor told me - well the chances that some will help you after those are rather low, so I stopped taking another one. After this pointless trial and error, I decided to not do those goddamn drugs anymore, anyways, this only changes what you truly are. Makes you slow, alters your personality, but helps? Not at all. Therapy - 2 years now, first a counsellor for my own, then group therapy - no changing to the better. I am done.

*Chapter 4: Source of my pain*

Of course, I tried to find out the source of all this. Why my life is so shit. Why I am a burden to everyone around me. Why I am trash for everyone. Why no one likes me. My reasoning told me, maybe it was because of looks, but no it can't be looks, then it wouldn't always turn that way, even when I am older. It must be something more complex. (Also one girl I liked told me directly ""and btw you are good looking (y)"".) ... Maybe it was because I have some Asperger type of personality? You see, I never got diagnosed with Asperger Syndrome, but I do feel like it. I have troubles interpreting the words and statements of others. I feel a huge derealization, can't connect with others, especially with the opposite gender, and everything I do for others feels like I am just adjusting for them. I also have an IQ of 125-130 (not meant to flex though, tested that three times at three different psychologists :/), which is another common trait for Aspergers, isn't it? After all, this might explain it, you see, I went out with girls I had emotions for but I always felt so detached. I do always feel that type of feeling anyways but in those situations even more intensified. It is not about the butterfly-in-my-stomach effect or something. It is something sad and depressing. I like to use the phrase ""Wrong Planet"" because this is what it feels like. What I feel like for a long time now.  

*Chapter 5: Future?*

I am sorry for the long text and probably edgy way of presenting it but this probably sums up why I am the way I am. For the tl;dr, I am on the edge of suicide. Didn't figure out the method yet but I live in a country where there are little ways (no guns and stuff), so maybe via jumping off a building or slicing the veins. I am not in the phase where I say, I am going to do it just after posting this but I am definitely planning it. However, I do give myself a few weeks to do some stuff for the last time and also to celebrate my birthday in May -&gt; I will see if no one cares for me again and no one wants to do something with me then, like always. You see, it sounds stereotypical but it is a hundred percent true, I actually don't want to die, I loved life when I was a child and stuff, always only wanted love, inner harmony and peace, sadly, I am the result of yearlong bad experiences and mental health issues that were untreatable, shaping my mentality and person in a way that is unrecognizable and in the end, I am tired of life, tired of Earth, tired of people, tired of waking up every morning in this prison I call my daily routine and never changing life, tired of this never-ending cycle of depression, tired of everything.",1

"SodudbiwbI've suffered from depression, and a few other mental ailments, for years but I've never been closer to killing myself than I am now. My work schedule is fucked up (work nights, and weekends) and I never realized until recently the full effects of social isolation. Newborns die from lack of social contact, and I now understand why. It's not just being lonely though. My brain chemistry is all messed up for a multitude of reasons, and I feel like a piece of shit in general. I can't afford therapy or drugs of any kind. I honestly don't even know why I'm writing this, other than some slight comfort in knowing there's company in misery. I'm just afraid one of these days I'm gonna swing by the armory to pick up a box of slugs and then go buy a bottle of whiskey, and that'll be that. Has anyone been super close to suicide?

Why do you think you deserve that? Your parents treated you like garbage because that's what you are. Just do the world a favor and get hit by a train.,1

"Tonight was the last one I could handle.A few months ago my (M22) boyfriend decide to open up our relationship without considering how it would affect (F23) me but I went along because he promised to be honest, open and share everything with me, it's not that way at all. He came home covered in hickies, when he was just going to a ""friend's house"" I have put everything into this relationship, I left my home, family, friends etc for him. Now I have no place to go and nothing but to suffer because I built my life around someone who's done with me five years and this is what I have to show for it. 

Tonight is my last, I can no longer live like this, all I wanted was a normal life. I just can't.",1

"I just want to be loved...more.  By strangers.  I am loved by a ton of people.  But I am selfish, and I want to be loved MORE.  From newer DIFFERENT people.  I can't stop it.  So in my 20's, I used to fill that void on the internet, meeting girls and having these fake online relationships where they would ""fall in love with me"", and it was the biggest ego boost ever blah blah blah. One of those girls I fell madly in love with and she broke my heart and I haven't been the same since.  Oh by the way, I was (and am) married with children during this entire time.  Now, in my 30's, I don't have the desire, drive or even ability to facilitate those types of ego boosts anymore.  I've lost it.  My mating dances don't work anymore, I'm used goods.  So now I don't have the influx of love and admiration and affection and desire from NEW people who DIDN'T already know me who were STRICKEN by something about me that they really liked.  And it really helped.  Waahhh wahhh, I know poooooor me.  Trust me, from the outside looking in, I'm like wahh wahh poor me too - it's all RIDICULOUS!  It's immoral, it's selfish, it's everything bad.  It's dishonest, I'm a liar, I am a cheater, I am a self-centered hedonistic PLEASE ME AND PLEASE ME NOW OR I WONT BE HAPPY piece of shit.  And so it's beCAUSE of this that now, more than ever before, the thought of taking my 12-gauge out to...I don't even know where..somewhere with meaning...is appealing with increasing and alarming frequency.  Why don't I do it?  Mainly the kids.  And I'm a pussy.

"I'm losing my ability to handle this.I've suffered from massive depression ever since I was a little child. I never remember ever actually being happy. I used to hurt myself when I was younger, hoping that something would happened to me. That I wouldn't be able to recover somehow. As I grew up, I started to fight the thoughts of self-harm. The thoughts that told me I should just quit and end it. I was always a lonely person. I even managed to get myself something or a girlfriend by age 26! And then, she screwed me over. Absolutely tore out my heart and gleefully laughed at it it seems. It's the worst feeling I've ever had. It's been a while and when I think I'm getting better, I break down again. I broke down at work and cried in front of customers, which is never actually fun. The Thoughts are back and stronger than ever.

I’ve tried antidepressants and my doctor had tried 4 different options and we kept having to change prescriptions because I was at the highest allowable dosage. I’ve gone to 5 different therapists and felt like I was wasting my money because they didn’t seem to acknowledge things I was talking about (I would talk about x and how it upset me then they would change the subject to y). I’ve tried and tried for 8 years to get help and get better and I feel like I’m done trying. 

I’m not scared to die but scared for what’s after. If I could end it without hurting my parents, friends, etc I would do it.

"I'm hating my existence.So, I've finally decided to share what I'm feeling with someone and that's why, here I am. Trying to write out the story of my life. Things have been really hard for me lately. I don't even know where to start so pardon me if it's all messy. So, I don't really hate my parents, but I'm really angry. I can't even explain this feeling. My parents want me to join their family business which I'm not really interested in. If I try telling them I wanna do something else, they tell me I'm not a good daughter and they might kill themselves someday if I continue behaving this way. The fact that they never even asked me what I want in my life and think that my life is theirs to decide, is what makes it worse. I'm basically feeling trapped. It's like I've got no way out of here. They won't even let me go out for my higher studies. And the worst part? They never saved any money for my higher studies. I don't want to hurt my parents by just running away or something. And let's get real, no matter what, you always need support. I don't even want to be a puppet to my parents, listening to every single order. I feel suffocated sometimes. Thinking there's no way out. It's like I'll be trapped here for forever. I seriously feel like this life is not worth living after all. I don't know what to do.

i hate my personalityI feel like im very weak. I hardly talk about normal things. I only come on Reddit to moan about my problems. I haven't got the ability to even make a comment about other stuff. Or at least it feels forced. Being whiney just comes naturally to me. IRL i whine to family. I cant force myself on dates so i will never get a girlfriend. I have very few friends. I once had an outgoing personality with many friends and i had a normal if not great life. Now i feel like a total loser. I feel like there's no one i can relate to. Even other depressed people have more going for them than i do. I've never had a decent job im 27 now. I will never accomplish anything good. Im too shy to do so many things. I dont have the confidence to do projects such as starting a business. I cant even force myself to go to places by myself sometimes. I won't even have a funeral because the only person that would come is my sister. If were talking hypothetically and i die at 75. Because my friends aren't close anymore. We only made friends when i was really outgoing buy im a shadow of my former self and as a result were drifting apart. I haven't made new friends for 10 years. A girlfriend is just unfeasible. I need to change my whole self. Im overweight with very little career prospects. There's nothing about myself i can genuinely take pride in. I have no good personal qualities that i can think of. I used to be funny etc but now im quite the opposite. I get on with most people but i have no social status and im not likable enough for people to take a shine to me. Im seen as unattractive to women now. Im just not normal. I was the cool type but I've changed on the inside. It's like someone took my personality and smashed it with a sledgehammer. I will not return to normal as its been 10 years and I've hardly shown glimpses of my former self. Not many people can say they definitely won't get a girlfriend but im one of them. I  could go on and on tbh,1

"I don’t know.Hello. I don’t know how to describe what I feel, my head is a complete mess these last days. I don’t know what to do with my life. Don’t know what do do and think. Sorry if this writing is a little long, you don’t have to read it all, but thanks if you do. It’s just a relief for my self to write something down and share, I don’t know hopefully I’ll feel a little better then. English isn’t my first language as well so sorry for that too. 

I just feel completely empty and lonely. Even though I have people around me who ‘care’. I don’t know where to start but let me say, I have been feeling different for as long as I can remember. As a young girl is was afraid of others, crowded places and to be judged. I can remember a moment where I was like 5: there was some kind of a celebration at school I didn’t wanted to attend to because I was afraid of other people (?). Mom let me stay at home. My childhood and teenage years are a blur, but this is what I remember where it all started. If I was afraid of something, my parent let me decide what to do. That caused that I am always on the background, even for now. I was thinking about suicide when I was probably 17/18. Wrote many notes. At that moment I didn’t even wanted to turn 18 and just wanna die. Leave the world, because no one will miss me anyways. I went to collage, didn’t felt at home. Had to go with the bus everyday, feeling so damn insecure and wanted to die so bad. Cried myself to sleep so many times. I couldn’t compare myself to others. Still don’t. I (somehow) finished school. Haven’t got a driver license bc I thought I wouldn’t be here for long so it wasn’t needed. I didn’t had the money as well.

I’m 27, and still here. Nothing changed in those years. I feel ashamed. Old school friends are getting married and having children .. this voice in my head says I don’t deserve this so why comparing myself to others. It’s the only thing I know. I went to a psychiatrist a few years ago, didn’t helped at all. They kinda forced me to be in this group with other people I didn’t feel comfortable with at all, I had nothing in common with them. I was mad. Still taking medication which also doesn’t help imo. I’m so disappointed in my self. Why didn’t I take my life away when I was 18!? Ten years later: I’m not living but surviving life. Escaping reality.

I absolutely never know why I felt this way. Those talks with the psychiatrist didn’t help because I myself even didn’t know what happened in life that make me feel so disgusted about myself. About a week or two ago I came across an article about emotional abuse/neglect. I felt like my heart was sinking and at the same moment everything felt in place. My parent didn’t support the things I did, never took me serious when I was afraid of things that seemed to be normal, or the things I was excited about. Never focused on the things I found difficult at school or helped me with that. This has lead to so many things as an adult, I feel stupid and unneeded. We never went on vacation as a family, they were always focusing with their own business. I still love them, don’t get me wrong. I’m just disappointed and wish I could do this all over again.

There are so many more things I wanted to write down, but I feel like a burden and don’t want to bother you all with my stupid words. I’m sorry. I just hope I’m not the only one. I hope there’s one person who reads this and thinks: finally, I’m not the only one. Who experienced the same, and I want to tell you that I love you and I’m proud you’re still here. Because living this life when you feel you don’t belong, I can’t tell you, it’s not easy.

After a lifetime of trauma without any consecutive breaks, I have a strong inner voice telling me to end my life. 

I was on meds for ten years after a serious breakdown. A lot of painful things occurred during that decade, and the resulting scenarios are causing much pain to this day. 

I've overcome a lot of traumatic experiences, pushed myself to the limits of desperation, and anger. The last thing I would ever want to do is cause pain to the small group of people who are still a part of my life. 

For the last year I haven't had health insurance. So I've been on and off of the meds that allowed me to function. My best friend has died during this time. He inspired me and held me in an esteem that nobody else ever will. His love made me feel so much more safety and value and now he is gone forever.

After a couple of attempts and some self injuring behaviors, I'm afraid of losing control. The loneliness has taken hold and once the walls are up it is very hard to bring them back down. Not sure what to expect by posting here, just really need to vent. 

My artistic  has disappeared with much more of my identity. Fun and joyful experiences have faded. It feels like I have nothing to look forward to. Life has just become something far from what I've expected and I've let myself down in so many ways.

I have reached out for help many times. Nothing has really panned out recently which is an additional challenge. This week I've finally got insurance so I can get some treatment but even the idea of revisiting the pain is very intimidating.",1
"I’ve never been so close. Looking after my friends cat, fucking thing tried to jump ahead of me little cunt. Dont know what to dohttps://ibb.co/pX1rG78",1
"I really need to know... what are the steps that would follow after my death?Who would be called? What would happen to my body? Where would I be taken? What would happen to my possessions? How long would it take for it to go public? I don't want to scar people with finding me, would it be better to not be found? Anything else you can think of",1
"I’ve never felt suicidal until recentlyProbably dropping out of uni for the 2nd time and the shame of telling my parents is so much, it was the first time I really considered killing myself. 

I’m not super close with anyone, including my family, and this was all I had. 

It’s something that’s been in the back of my mind the past couple of days. ",1
"When I was 16, I almost killed myself. I'm starting to feel the same wayAnd I told my best friend at the time that I was about to do it. I guess she thought I was saying all of this for attention, because she responded my telling me that if I did it then people would get over it, that my death would just brush off in a couple weeks. All I ever wanted was to prove her wrong. And now, two years later, I'm beginning to feel the same way I felt back tw years ago when I was ready to die",1
"I am worthless...I admit it, i am worthless... I am a waste of oxygen, nothing good will ever come from me and i admit it, that i am just not worth of being in this world
I am a ninth grader who has always clinged to a fragment of hope to pass the class since seventh and now, i can barelly find any hope of passing 9 class. School has always been the main reason why i feel despair when i go to sleep, when i wake up and when i even think about life. I am stupid, i can't learn some things, i am just not worth it. I want to study alone with a private teacher because that worked out fine for me during eight grade and actually got positive grades, now the teachers that had free time to give me private lessons have their own classes to teach and i have to join the rest of my class and try to learn with teachers that  i cant learn from...
I hate my life, i really wish i could love it, but school overall is just hurting my insides.
This has gone to the point where i even hear weird noises in my mind, whispering me ""suicide, kill yourself etc"" and i am starting to go crazy from it.
I really could use some motivation to cure this madness that has plagued my mind for a long time now.
I don't have many friends, i don't like to go outside a lot and i definitely am not sociable.

"HopelessI just spent the last 45 minutes on the phone with the national suicide prevention hotline. Aside from asking a few questions (are you alone, are you planning on hurting yourself, etc), the person I talked to really only repeated what I said. I’d say my health issues/living situations/relationship were affecting me drastically, and all he said back was, “so it sounds like you’re having health/financial/relationship issues” and then ask me to repeat what I literally had just said. Then afterwards not offering any words or advice or even a, “it’ll get better.” He just kept asking me to repeat myself. Towards the end of the call, he essentially said, “I don’t think there’s much I can do for you. Are you okay enough right now to get off the phone?” 

I don’t know what to do. I feel so stuck, in almost every way I can be. I’m trying so hard to get my license and get a job and help myself, but I keep having uncontrolled seizures and I’m so scared I’ll never be able to help myself. My anxiety crippled me to the point where I don’t think I’ll be able to get a job and handle it appropriately, no matter how badly I want to. My boyfriend says he’s going to break up with me because of finances, though he doesn’t pay for anything for me and the few dollars I scrape together I give to him so he can continue to have a home. I’m homeless, trying to pay for my insulin, food, meds for my seizures, HSV medication, I’m trying not to break down every second of the day or disappoint my dad by ending it. I just feel so fucking hopeless and scared and I don’t think I can keep doing this. I feel my brain deteriorating from this constant stress and sadness and anger and anxiety, my memory is so bad I can’t even remember key parts of a conversation I had this morning or even who it was with. I’m breaking down over the smallest things. I’ve lost about 40 pounds in a month and a half. I don’t know what to do. I don’t want to keep living like this",1
"No one understands how I could be a parent and also suicidal
The first time I tried to kill myself I was 11 years old. From that moment on I have been dealing with unrelenting depression. For almost 20 years since that first attempt, I have tried almost everything to cure or alleviate my symptoms:

I’ve been on antidepressants,
I’ve completed inpatient and outpatient therapy, 
I tried to find God, join a church, volunteer 
I studied Buddhism/meditation/mindfulness, 
I’ve tried introspection while on psychedelics,
I’ve tried fasting,
I’ve tried lifting weights/daily running,
I’ve tried to get more sleep,
I’ve tried so many things...

But the biggest mistake of my life was trying to manufacture a stereotypically “happy” life by getting married and having children. Like an idiot, I thought I could mend the trauma of a shitty childhood by giving my own children a happy life. Thinking back I realize what a selfish and irresponsible decision this was, but obviously I cannot change this now. 

I love my children, and for a few years they were literally the ONLY reasons for staying alive and going through the motions. They do bring me joy and give me purpose, but my brain has a way of stealing my happiness. Over the past year or so, I have convinced myself that I should kill myself soon, while they’re too young to remember me. Now they look at me with unconditional love—I am beautiful and kind and capable in their eyes. But I know that over the years, they will see me as the fat sack of useless shit I actually am. I’m starting to feel that I should leave while they are still happy, functioning kids. My spouse will easily find another partner who will hopefully accept them as their own. Don’t get me wrong, I know that there may be some residual pain leftover from losing a parent, but consider the alternative: impressionable young kids watching me having panic attacks at the wheel (driving anxiety), crying for days on end, gaining and losing 50 lbs each year as I spend days too sad to eat or too sad to stop eating, going to inpatient therapy for a week every 3 years because I said the wrong thing to my counselor. Surely that is a recipe for disaster.

I’ve told people this but no one seems to understand how I could be so selfish to bring my children into this world just to leave them behind. My therapist told me once “think of your children.” Yes, I am ALWAYS thinking of my children. As I said before, this strategy worked in the past. But now I know that my death is better than my existence. 

Are there any parents here that understand what I mean? Anyone who lost a parent while they were too young to remember, can you tell me how it has affected you today?",1
"I Wasn't Meant To Live (M, 16)If there is a god out there, then he is a cruel god. When I was born I had a physical disability which included me being born with a crooked neck, and I had to wear a brace to even survive. That's right, less than a couple of hours of life and I already was biologically meant to die. The brace itself gave me another curse, for it had rubbed off the hair on the back of my head, leaving permanent bald spots that people see when I cut my hair. Heck, I tried getting a mohawk and it is still there.

Anyways, I always have been subject to adapting to differing customs and cultures multiple times now, and everytime I had to leave a country, lose all my friends that I had, and start over and learn a new language, be forever deemed a foreigner. (My family kept moving because my dad would always find a better place that pays more money for him to work with lasers and physics and whatnot) People might think it's nice moving to places, it's not, especially when you have to adapt to their customs. When I moved to America I spent my entire 5th grade year only accompanied by some ADHD kid that has now done more good for society than I have. The entire class was against me, I was subject to harassment and people ignoring me, and even the principal did not stop the onslaught. If I had known what suicide was, I would have done it now.

I moved to a new town, and at first, it was decent. At first. I feel like a complete loser now. All my friends do sports/extracurricular activities, have girlfriends, and have social lives. All that I have is myself, my parents who get mad at me for getting Bs on small assignment, and the internet. It's all I do, play videogames when I get home. I don't do sports because it's not worth it. I've tried before with Basketball (Twice, Basketball is my home countries' sport.) and failed my dad and was a weight on the team that didn't need it. Out of two season I only scored two points, and was almost always behind my competitive teammates.

I did compulsory HS Gym and felt a bit better, cause I started to get good at running, but not track-material. In fact, I'm nothing material. There's no point in me trying for any sports because I'm just a drag and don't exercise. Now I'm getting fat and have stretchmarks on my belly (Pretty sure those marks will be permanent) and all I want to do is play videogames, cause that's the only thing I'm good at. Don't give me that whole 'looks aren't really important' crap, because no girl would like to hang out with someone who plays videogames all day like me.

I mean, I can play the violin but I suck at it, planning to quit next year. Somehow managed to get to 1st violin section (2nd violins are infamous for being utter crap, and 1sts are the actual good players) but I was last chair. Yay. The only reason people know me is because my name is goddarn difficult to say.

I wish I could end it all, but I can't because I don't want to leave a scar on people's lives. Yet, I'm always thinking what would truly happen if I just dropped dead, and how to do it. Anyways, I know these generations before me wasted their time and energy on a creation like me, because I'm pretty much certain that I'm the end of the legacy.

I guess this is all I will say. For now. Hoping this 'blue' period doesn't turn into anything worse.",1

"Would like to be in the ground.Not feeling life right now. Everything has been incredibly disappointing. Both relationships I thought I had over the past 2 weeks or so have been bullshit and I feel so let down. I struggle with self harm as well and haven’t done it for a decent few days until tonight. I cannot stand my family as it is plagued by my parents narcissism and favouritising towards my younger siblings. I don’t really know if I want to go on. But the most painful thing for me is that my friend hasn’t been talking to me tonight because of a few reasons. 
Quite recently she got a girlfriend and I was really happy for her, she said don’t go looking for her Instagram. I looked for a laugh and found it really quickly, I then said it to my friend and she got really upset. I told her I was sorry and that I was an asshole numerous times. This evening I saw her art accounts story saying that she had lost a lot of motivation for things. Then around a few hours ago I sent her a slightly disturbing meme I found on here and she said no. I am going to block you now. And now I cannot help but think that this is my fault and that I am incredibly annoying and nobody wants to be around me. 
I don’t know if I am able to do this shit anymore. I’d like to be pushing up daisies by my next birthday. I don’t know how I will do it or when I will do it. But I don’t want to ruin everyone’s Christmas by me killing myself, if they would even care.",1

"I'm so ready to end this.The last year has not been kind to me. I've lost best friends, done horribly in school, and am on a fast track to relying on pot to get me through the night in one piece. I don't know what I'm doing and at this point I don't particularly care. Who says every soul is compatible with this life? Why should they have to be? What's the point in living if you can't enjoy it? I don't see what's so great about this. No one cares about me, all I do is fuck things up. I've already been hospitalized, so it's not like this would come as a shock to anyone. Probably a relief to most, honestly. My boyfriend would be so much happier if he could follow his dreams without the burden of my dependence. My mother could leave town, start again somewhere she'll actually enjoy. My best friend... well, she'll find someone new. She's wonderful enough that she'll have no problem moving on. My dad would be thrilled to not be disappointed in me anymore. How dare the daughter of an engineer long to be an artist? My point is, there's nothing keeping me tethered but others' expectations.

"What to do?Ok so I knew this woman for 11 years through work, so 1/3rd my life! never really thought about her that way except that she was hot! and really nice and cool to be around. She quit the job because management did not give her respect that she was looking for and she can't work somewhere where she can't be respected. They talked about her behind her back a lot apparently.

She had a talk with her family what she was going to do, she end up quitting at the end of July! once I found out she was quitting I literally became depressed...I've known her for 11 years! we threw her a goodbye party, she said she was feeling the love from everyone (everyone loved her there). I wrote her a note and dedicated my first drink to her, she needed time to herself for a second or she was going to cry. Got drunk, drove her home, we hugged, I asked her for her phone number but she said to ask her on facebook. Once she was gone I stopped talking to everyone...depressed, crying, etc.

Then a week later I asked her if she was getting her high school, she was getting it online (not anymore though), so I told her you get your HS and i'll drop my weight and she agreed. I'm no longer depressed! working my ass off for a month trying to lose weight and manage to lose 35 pounds in that month! finally hit under 200 for the first time since my early 20's!

Start getting depressed again, she's not talking to me much on FB either...take off FB for a month, come back and a week later one of the coolest guys I know quits and the people at my work don't invite me to his goodbye party, I get REALLY depressed and i'm ready to end my life now..announce on my FB i'm thinking of killing myself! then that woman messages me to message her ASAP and wants my phone number to chat on the phone or meet for a coffee! told her not right now, just to text so we text 2 times a day every day for a few weeks.

We meet up for a coffee and talk for 4 hours! our texting drops to once every 3 days, we meet up again later for another coffee for an hour and a doctors visit to talk about my problem! then for a walk along the water and sit at a rock, she does some yoga and sits next to me looking at me but i'm staring at the water, but I can see her staring at me from the corner of my eye. We walk some more, then drives me home. An hour later I write ""it's a great day"" on my FB, she writes ""it's a good day"" and didn't realize what I wrote and that she NEVER posts updates on her facebook! It's Sept 9th at the time, she already knows how much I appreciate her and we had our arms around eachother a few times as we walked as we are just friends. I got my anti depressants the next day at work...

A week later she comes back to the docs with me, but no coffee...she wanted to know if we would meet up or not but I was overdosing on the anti depressants and felt like SHIIIIT so I said to just meet at the docs. She gets to the docs, I tell him I took all 30 anti depressants in the 6 days I had them, even though I only took 15, but I wanted another 30 so I can overdose on 45 and hopefully die. He takes my blood pressure and it's 200/99 so he calls for an ambulance to pick me up and I spend 5 hrs in the hospital! She came with me but she was not sure if she should come or not, so I told her only if you want to come then come so she did. She stayed for 45 minutes, her birthday was the next day (37) and her family planned a supper for her the day I was in the hospital but that was 3 hours from the time she left. I told her a few days later my REAL motive for getting more pills...so I can overdose and die! she tells me to tell the doc the truth! and we are friends for life as I was asking if she was mad and didn't wanna continue the friendship anymore.

Now she's texting me once a week! and only for like 5 minutes to check in quickly? I visit her the beginning of Oct at her new job, she wants to meet up a few weeks after when I visit the doctor by myself next and I talked to her when I could for a few hrs at her job, so I visit the doc and tell him the truth that I wanted to overdose and die and tell him I wont do it again! so he gives me the paper to get another 30 pills, but once again I have lied...my new plan was to get 4 months worth of pills and take a fatal dose, but I'll explain later.

Like I said, she only texts once a week now...I made her cry when she found out I saved someones life by donating 5 grand to someone I have not seen since I was a kid and that she told me I have a sweet soul and an angel. Told her I would do the same for her if she ever needed help anytime and that I meant it, always. Told her I would come back with a few guys from work in a few weeks but that was 3 weeks ago...I literally can't stand life anymore and I've been more depressed NOW that I have ever been! can't stop thinking about her for one...also life stuff I wont get into.

Thursday the 13th I felt like I had a MAJOR meltdown. Also was on the phone with these mental health people and I was all drunk and crying and I kid you not, even the woman on the other end was crying...I got so drunk after the phone call and was ready to ovderdose on my 30 pills I still have. We were supposed to meet for our 3rd coffee that Saturday but her phone got wet and died and because I deleted my facebook she had no way to reach me. 

Last Saturday I was about to end my life in my room with a knife to my throat but I got a text from her to tell me her sister did not give birth yet and a buddy text me what happened to him and I got a thank you card for saving that womans life, so as much as I wanted to I could not do it...I tried! I really tried...could not do it, but maybe soon? I text the woman back the next day, she still wants to meet up but I told her when she's not busy! I REALLY wanna help her reach a goal of hers but it's a lot of money and I don't think she will let me, but I don't care about money, I make plenty...i'll work to make her happy! just don't give a shit about myself...

I feel so alone...no matter what people say to me, even that girl back in Sept said she will help me if I need it but It seems she was only around to help me with the doctors part back in Sept. Now I feel like we are drifted apart as our texting is pretty much done it seems like. But I still feel so alone and disconnected, even after all these months. I'm in tears writing this....I just wish my life was over and i'm not worth anything to anybody! I spend 99% of my day sitting infront of my PC wishing people would text me or want to hang out, but it never happens. I also wish I was closer with that woman and she wanted me around...she has no idea of how I feel except that I feel bad. Wish I had the strength and guts to just just end it all, even if nothing happens when you die...better then this.",1
"Feeling like shitI'm 28 years old and have done essentially nothing with myself since I was about 15. I haven't been able to hold a good job for very long, and have been unemployed for about a year now. I was just denied the best job opportunity of my life because I failed the drug screen, (smoking pot now and then helps me deal with depression) and I'm just about at the end of my rope.

I don't know how to face my friends and family anymore. Putting on a smile and lying about how I'm feeling to everyone isn't fun at this point, but I also can't bring myself to tell anyone how I'm actually feeling. How much I hate myself. How much I'm tired of being a fucking waste. So I'll post it anonymously on the internet.

I've had suicidal thoughts before, but never acted on them, mostly because I do love the people in my life and don't want to make them upset over it: mostly my parents. My younger brother already thinks I'm a piece of shit, and that fucking kills me too.

Anyway, as I was driving home from the lab I was crying in my car telling myself over and over that ""When I get home, I'm going to kill myself."" I got home, went to the basement, made a noose out of an extension cord, stood on a chair, and put it around my neck. Then I broke down crying again and went to my computer to try to cool off. That's what brings me here.

This is the only time I ever came close to harming myself in any way, and that scared the shit out of me. I don't WANT to do it, but being a lazy piece of shit nobody for so long is really fucking my mind up. I'm in a long rut, and I feel that it's not so simple as picking myself up by the bootstraps and getting my shit together.",1
"Am I justified in killing my aggressors?[**PREFACE**: /eatingdisorders is dead and empty. This post has the tone of an /offmychest entry, but I'm putting it here. If any of you have a problem with that, I will stab you in the face.]

Hi. This is my actual account. Yeah. I'm that serious. Things are bad.

I will state how, so that readers may know what the fucking deal is.

From 2005 to 2009 I dedicated myself to fitness. [1][Progress](http://i.imgur.com/szhKD.png) [2][was](http://i.imgur.com/c524L.jpeg) [3][made](http://i.imgur.com/NPTmJ.png).

Then, I had digestive issues, or I blamed my relationship issues on my digestion so I could avoid meals with my father. Wouldn't you know it, [weight loss] (No Pics). The trend continued as I worked like a 19 to 13 hour days &amp; maintained a strict diet of foods that would stay down. 

A good night's sleep was rare. I lost my job, but I looked like [4][this](http://i.imgur.com/FNgLe.png). 

My life got tougher. I [5][reinvested](http://i.imgur.com/zPdSu.png) [6][in](http://i.imgur.com/zPdSu.png) [7][exercise](http://i.imgur.com/HqN5g.png). [8][Too thin](http://i.imgur.com/bfog2.png), not enough mass at 132 lbs, 5' 5."" How much body fat? Not enough. 

""Gee,"" I thought. ""If exercises are getting harder with all this extra cardio, obviously *I'm just not lifting enough weight*."" So I increased the weight I lifted. While sleeping less, exercising more, and eating less.

Against my better judgement, I then went on a major bike ride that drained all of my body's glycogen reserves for the next week. Since I bonked very hard. Very, hard. As I was accompanying my father on his ""recovery ride,"" I wondered why I couldn't move my body. Why didn't it work? All I understood was that I was very, very, very sad and frustrated. */sadface*

A rider picked me up; a fellow cyclist. Hallelujah!* I was dropped off at the car. I needed food. I asked for it, but my father just got angry. He could not understand why I was so obsessed with food. [BTW, I'm crying right now].

But, eventually after much persistence and begging on my part, he agreed to pay for a trip to the doctor's office, all $74 of it (as I lay dying. hahahaha, weepweepweep).

A few days later, I lay on the bed of - get this - a medical doctor who just so happened to specialize in eating disorders. 

* She weighed me: 126.1 lbs. I had lost five or six pounds (glycogen and water, I'm betting) in a few days. 

* She measured my resting pulse at 37 beats per minute. ""Hey!"" I thought, ""just like the endurance athletes."" I knew I was a bad ass.

Then she ran an EKG &amp; told me I had [Bradycardia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradycardia)[wiki]. I did not know what that meant. I still do not. 

She strongly suggested that I see a nutritionist, and that I add more fat to my diet. ""Okay!"" I thought, ""Finally I will be able to eat fatty foods without criticism from my father. Finally. Finally. :(

It took me almost an hour to decide what to eat after our meeting. I regretted the decision I had made over thinking it. Vietnamese was not what the doctor ordered. *yuck, yuck, yuck*

With doctor's writ in hand, I approached my father. With proof that I should be able to eat the foods I wanted to eat, he could not mock me or deny me. **FINALLY!**

Rather than consuming the 1300 Calories + exercise/activity expenditure, I ate about 3600 calories. It was great. I had pizza. 

First thing the next day, I had a full panel of tests drawn at a Quest Diagnostics lab. The results arrived in under a week.
- - - 
The results showed that everything was normal except for:

* white cell count (low)
* mean platelet volume (low)
* absolute monocytes (low)
* testosterone (*way the fuck* low)
* Mg (high)
* cholesterol (high)
* transferrin saturation (low)
* iron (low)
- - - 

I understood very little of the results at that time, but it was obvious that if my testosterone was low, then I could not put on muscle, which explained why my workouts had gotten so hard. 

- - - 

. *I'm non-theist.


*Pre-edit* I have to go now. This wi-fi shop is about to close down. I have wi-fi at my current ""residence"" so I will update in about two hours. I will finish my telling before I finish everything.

**EDIT 1 20110822 22:46:46 PT**

I've been up for four days in a row. I will finish posting this tomorrow. Not dead yet. Also, I will not name names, so no charges can be filed, or ISPs requested so long as I do not threaten general or specific individuals.

"Ashamed of what I am.I don't even want to write this, I just feel shame and guilt.  I can't be bothered to put in the effort to live.  I thought going to college would help me, get an education; get a better job, or so I thought.  Here it is, the middle of summer and I'm working part-time at Wendy's, unable to keep up on rent.  Student loans up to my eyeballs, nothing and no-one to fall back on.  The only person I speak to on a regular basis is my counsellor at the college, but between that and anti-depressants they don't seem to have any affect.  The only way I can get though the day is to get high, or drunk and space out on the internet/games.  And now my landlord has let me know that he has a friend that could move into where I'm living as early as Tuesday.  


I actually tried cutting myself for the first time.  Only welts as I was to chicken-shit to actually end it.  It's not so much that I want to die, I just don't want to keep living this life.  I wish I could just lay down and fall asleep and not wake up.  I'm sure my parents would look after my cat, lol.",1
"I’m tiredThis is it, one last cherry on top, one last failure.

I worked so hard, for nothing and I can’t do this anymore. This life fucking sucks and I’m sorry for the rest of y’all that will have to suffer for however much longer y’all are here. I’m a disappointment alive or not, to my self and everyone around me, but life goes on, good bye",1

"When the feather weighs a ton.The final straw, the last laugh, and the deciding factor are not always extremely significant or greatly impactful things. They are simply the culmination of a burden that one can bear no longer. All the small things add up. The demon that has been fought for years or decades has grown beyond the capacity for defeat. Am I to blame for this? Does it even matter? 

My life has been a myriad of mental wars. Childhood abuse (sexual, physical, and emotional) were buried so I could face the world and try to make a better life for myself. A marriage plagued by mistreatment and mental abuse bore the fruit of two wonderful children. They are grown now and since I finally found the courage to leave their mother I completely lost communication with one and the other is a few words a day if I am lucky. 

The hopefully me allowed myself to fall in love again. I love my wife, but the little white lies, veiled intentions, and twists of fault never seem to cease. I feel as though no matter how much good I do or how hard I try to make everything the best it can be, I am a failure. Opening doors, treating her like a queen, cooking and cleaning, working multiple jobs, and doing all within my ability to make our home amazing seems to not be enough. I am not enough. My heart is shattered because she knows my past and is undeterred in doing the things she knows hurt me the most. I am a great husband, but it is never enough. 

Again I find myself staring into the depths of the demon’s eyes. Back to the beckoning call of each moment showing a way out of this meaningless existence. Back to knowing that it wouldn’t matter if the semi slammed into me, if I fell from the cliff, if I took the bullet, if the pills all disappeared, or if my wrists cried as I do. Last night, while she took a bath (lots of those as of late), after yet another failure on my part I took a walk. I’m so unnoticed in my own home that a 10pm wall on a rainy night doesn’t even register. I stared at the ocean and thought about who would miss me if I were able to walk out and never return. Sadly, the ocean roared back with the same empty answer that I have always known. When I cease this existence nothing will change. My phone will still be silent, my funeral will be as big a lie as my life, and every false tear shed will be an attempt that was never made to be a friend. 

I have all of the options , means, and will. Now I simply have to make my decision. I can no longer fight my demon because he is the only one that has never left me or changed.",1
"I can’t stop feeling this way but i WANT to so badlyI moved for work. Got a great job with nice coworkers right out of college. I have a great apartment in a great community. I have little student debt, I have my own personal vehicle with no payments and I can afford the essentials and quite a lot of entertainment on the side. 

If you saw my life from the outside you’d think how the hell is this guy slipping down the slope, and the answer is i don’t know and I don’t want to but I am.

I lost most of my friends when I moved, the girl I loved as a friend and a little more. I’ve been here for months and I don’t have a single friend. My job has prevented me from being able to have any free time during the week. I hate this part of my job. I just lost my voice screaming fuck this shit at the top of my lungs and I have to get up and do it again tomorrow. My family doesn’t understand how I could possibly be upset given my circumstances. 

I feel like I’m drowning and every day I get a little closer to going under. Today I got to the point where actually having everything turn off sounded so relaxing and calm and I just don’t know what to do anymore.",1
"it's hard to start overi was doing really well. I was getting healthy, i was talking to friends and actually doing work. It's always the same thing. I manage to be healthy and productive for a week or so, and then i meet my social worker to tell them the great news. Afterwards, i usually fall back into a deep hole of despair where i wind up bingeing (or purging) for several days before eventually trying to take my life. I've only had two almost successful attempts - i always try to up the pills (had to go to ER once, however) or walking back home and trying to fix myself because dying would ruin my family's lives.

To give a bit of insight i started having an ed when i was around 12 or 13, and the stress quickly spiralled into me bunking off school &amp; using my eating disorder to forget about the work i had to catch up on. I gained a couple of pounds and i stopped going out as much because i felt too big. So on top of me missing school &amp; work, i was closing myself off from my friends, eating like shit and not exercising enough.

I'm 15 now, and i was doing well these past few months but now I can't do anything. I'm so stressed and scared all the time &amp; spend most of my time sleeping, when i can't even do that i binge drink or eat until i'm too tired to stay awake. I'm too scared to leave my home &amp; too scared to open messages. So I'm basically accomplishing nothing.

I've gained serious weight over the past two weeks. The only time i ever feel safe &amp; comfortable is in the shower, but I can't stay in there all day. I don't know what's wrong with me, if I let myself think for too long I get really wound up, i suddenly want to die. I'm not interested in going through with dying anymore, but the only reason i wake up each morning is so that my mum and brother think I'm okay. I don't talk to them anymore either, i'm too tired.

I guess what im looking for is how i can get back to being a productive person and stay that way, when i can't leave my home and can't say anything to anyone. The walls are closing in - if i stay like this any longer, I'll probably be kicked out of my school and be put into a care home by my fuck-all-knows social worker, and then I'll really have to die",1

"I can’t deal with this anymore. I just want to leave this. All of itI don’t know how this stupid Reddit thing goes but I’m rushing this down because i still have a shit ton of homework to do and several projects. I’m in the 10th grade, currently enrolled into a prestigious private college-prep lab school, taking exclusive honors classes and several AP classes which take up my whole schedule-including my free period and my electives. I thought I could handle this. I didn’t just waltz in and just carelessly chooses rigorous classes on the fly. I’ve been planning and scheduling the majority of my high school life since middle school. Starting right at the Climax-my parents are in the middle of getting their things situated for a divorce and every single day they screaming and go for each other’s throat-hearing your name being dropped by your own dad who’s supposed to love you but hates your guts and your mother who hates you because you look like him. I thought I could keep up with my school life but I find it hard to concentrate these first few weeks of 2nd semester and now I’m failing every single class. Even though I force myself to sleep 8 hours I still wake up in the middle of the nights and still find myself extremely tired. I’m fucking done trying to overachieve  when everyone who should be caring about me and loving me-friends and family-are the ones who are hurting me. Not to mention my fucking teachers could care less or in their words,”Suck it up, this is life. If you can’t handle it then opt out of it.” At this point I’m honestly looking forward to end all of this. Suicide is the only thing that I’m working towards now. But hopefully I wait until my last volleyball season. Then I’ll execute my plan to leave this shithole",1

"Regimental Schooling This week for me was going great. I came home Saturday evening after a 5 hour drive South from my home feeling confident after taking my SAT. I had a somewhat relaxed Sunday and finished all the work I had to and prepared for a somewhat busy week. 

However i didn't know that Monday would be probably the worst Monday of my life. 

Of course, Mondays are bad. The feeling of going to work, to school, stating 5 days of &lt;insert something negative&gt;. However a grade came in for me, a 65% on an exam for my AP US History class. To give context on this, I go to a pretty competitive public highschool and I am currently a Junior. We had written an in-class DBQ (a special kind of US History essay format) as a test finishing our unit and as a kind of prep for the AP exam this year. I was kinda cruising at a 89.98, and the next minor assignment would have pushed my grade to a borderline A-, and I was kinda pumped.

The grade came in before my period started, and I guess u could say I was a little shocked. I am not an extremely over-performing top 0.1% student, but I manage to get good grades. As literally everyone else in my class, I took to the group chat with everyone in the class. From the conversation, everyone was getting somewhere in the range 50-75%. Nobody got over an 85.

When class started, our fatass of a teacher explained her reasoning behind the grading, as she was using the AP grading scale. If you are not familiar with the AP grading scale, you only need like a 70% raw score in the multiple choice, free-response, essay section etc. combined to get a 5/5 on the exam. So basically she graded without partial credit, no mercy. Everyone in the class was shocked. By everyone, I mean everyone, even the teacher's kissass pet. Her justification behind this was **""It is a realization and a wakeup call to prepare for the AP Exam. If you got over a 70% you will do great (5/5) on the AP Exam!""** If I was this close to a 5/5, why didn't I get the 100/100, or even the 80/100 (4/5)? This was the frustration for many other students. the teacher might think our overall grades are amazing, but literally nobody else on the planet would consider an 84% reasonable.

I talked with the boys on the discord VC after school, and those in APUSH said their grades dropped by 5%, as did mine. Now it is barely recoverable, and the teacher probably screwed over everyone else and their future GPA's as well. Everyone I knew to have As in the class (pretty much everyone) no longer had it. Not only is this a significant drop in a statistic, it is a huge drop in morale. HUGE. I worked my ass off so far to have one unfairly graded exam drop it to a grade I have never observed to be so low in my life. My grade is so low, and it can barely be recovered, what is the point of even trying in the class anymore? Is there a purpose at all? In anything?

If you think that the 84% is actually not bad, I respect that, but I would also like to reiterate that I live i an extremely competitive, stressful area where A's are nearly mandated by parents and Colleges.

TLDR: The teacher's irreversible and regimental grading policy for this one exam has quite literally screwed over every student in APUSH this year, and everyone's future with a trashy GPA. The system is pretty fucked NGL.

We argued and yelled all the way from her moms house till we got out of the col de sac. She kept saying things like I hope I die and I hope we crash and didn't put her seatbelts on until later. Then when she was fiddling with the a/c the windows fogged up and she exclaimed that they should just fog up the whole windshield... I snapped and slammed on the breaks. In that moment I ruined 3 months of progress on her back healing up.. she's in the worst pain of get life and it's my fault. I want to kill myself so she can collect my insurance and get back to healing up. She deserves better. She didn't have these issues until I came into her life. Everyone I meet ends up hating me.,1

"I'm so scaredI'm not even sure what to write. Suicide has been on my mind again. Today I cut myself. I carved the word ""loser"" onto my thigh. That's what my ""parents"" called me this morning. I have actively tried to kill myself before, but ended up in the hospital instead. Right now I just feel apathy. I'm so apathetic that I really don't care if I walk out in front of a moving car and get hit. The thought of that actually calms me down, because I'm scared to attempt actively again. But the other way seems selfish to strangers involved. I just wish someone hated me as much as I hate myself, so enough to do something about it. I'm too scared. Luckily, I suppose. I'm considering going to the hospital and asking for help, but I'm also scared of these things forever being on my back once they write it all down in my journal. And I'm scared of being medicated again because it just fucked me up before. The problem lies in my circumstances and not the chemical composition of my brain. I was happy when I was away, but the stuff I hear at home is starting to stain me to the point where it alters my behaviour and gives me thoughts like this. I don't know what to do, I just want it to be over fast. 
I'm sorry if it doesn't make much sense, I just don't feel like I have anyone to talk to and therefore posted here. I'm battling whether or not to go to the hospital or just let it continue until I break completely. I don't fucking know what to do and I'm sorry for my existence",1

"The closest I’ve ever been.It feels like I’m doing everything that I’m supposed to be doing. I moved out of my parent’s place, I’m seeing a therapist, I’m being more open with friends and family. I’m eating better, I’m losing weight, I’m doing stuff that I want to do. Most days, I’m ok. 
But then it also feels like those days I’m just ignoring the problem. And then there’s the days, like today, when it becomes too much and I can’t ignore it anymore. My friends have been nothing but supportive and understanding, but I fear the day when their patience runs out. I don’t get over stuff easily or normally or in any reasonable amount of time, I never have. 

I have my therapist but every time I have a session, things are fine. It’s like my mind knows when a session is coming up and makes me feel great around then so that when she asks how I’ve been doing, I just focus on that and say “I’ve been great”. I get this weird anxiety about mentioning the times I haven’t been great because I’m like “oh that was last week, it doesn’t make sense to bug her about it now”. 

I just don’t actually know what I’m doing anymore, or why. I’ve spent most of the last decade focusing on the wrong person and things and now that I don’t have that focus, I don’t know what I’m supposed to do. I don’t have a goal. It feels like everyone my age is already way ahead of me, and I have so much catching up to do that it almost feels pointless.

I have a thing with someone new and he’s wonderful but every sweet and kind thing he does scares me because I’m not used to it. It feels like my last relationship left me too broken to ever really succeed in another one, and sometimes I find myself wondering when his patience will run out and he’ll decide I’m not worth it either. 

Because I just moved I have about a year before I can think about going to school. There’s already this pressure that once that year is up, I HAVE to go to school and do something and I just don’t know what that is supposed to be, and I don’t think I’m gonna figure it out by then. I’m just treading water, and I’m getting tired, and the more I think about just stopping and letting myself sink, the more soothing that idea sounds. I’ve never really fantasized about it, and now I am, and it’s scaring me. I don’t know what else to do.

I initially posted this a bit ago and deleted it after because I felt silly doing it. But it’s still a problem, and I still don’t know what to do about it. So I guess it doesn’t matter if it’s silly or not.",1

Every night I think about doing it again. University is making me anxious and I feel really terrible because I am not catching up on my classes and I am not attending my labs anymore. I feel bad because my dad pays for my study and I wasted everything. I am thinking of jumping from the 8th floor of our research building but that would be really selfish for other students seeing me dead on my pool of blood or even my parents seeing me dead in my bedroom closet with a rope. 

I am losing my mind, even reaching a therapist makes me anxious. :( 
I constantly lie that I am doing well in my studies but itâ€™s the complete opposite. Maybe Iâ€™ll do the rope method again and drink a lot of alcohol with lots of analgesic.",1
"This is it.After dinner, Im heading into the woods. I have a rope ready, it will be very dark so no one will notice.   It should be nice and quick. I guess this is the end. If I don't commit, ill die anyway but why wait that long? Why wait till I'm old, weak, ugly and disabled. Why go through all those years of pain for nothing.

"I hold no purpose in this life.I made the worst mistake of my life in February 2018. At the time, it was the middle of my junior year of high school, and I suffered a mental breakdown and had to leave school. I was #1 in my class at the time and possibly could’ve been valedictorian if I stayed. 

I started doing online school after that, but I’m just now starting my senior year while my friends are going to college. I’m so behind. I hate myself so much for leaving. I’m such a fucking idiot. I went from being the best in my class to nearly a high school drop out. 

I don’t have the energy to keep going. I wish I had had a true senior experience with my friends but I gave that up. Now my life is set for failure. Everyone is curious asking me when I’ll go to college, what I’m doing with my life... etc. Being a fucking failure is what I’m doing. 

I just don’t know what to do anymore. I hate this life.",1
"Its my 18th birthday and I am feeling suicidalHey guys, I am turning 18 tomorrow and I feel horrible. I've been struggling with depression for 5 years . I recently started taking meds , but instead of helping me feel better I think I feel worse. I used to be so social and outgoing and for 1 year everything is going downhill.. I treat my family and my closest friends like shit and I cant help myself ignoring them and saying things i dont want to and it hurts me more than it hurts them.. I barely survive school, I am tired all the time and I lay in bed most of the day.. I feel alone as fuck all the time and Ive never had a one ""true love"". I think I have noone to talk to and share my pain with.. In school I have a group of ""friends"" with whom I only hang out to pass time and cant relate at all and they only talk to me if they want something... And there it is ,tomorrow is my birthday and instead of thinking of throwing a party and having a good time , I am thinking of how I am wasting my time , how worthless and insignificant I am, how I will fail in life and in univerity and how I want to die..
My brother's best friend killed himself when he was just 19 or 20 and I remember the pain he went through and I dont know if I can do this to him again...I feel like everyone know that I am feeling awful and there are trying to help me and I just keep rejecting them even tho I need their support, I feel horrible for that..

"Broken tin soldier laying down his rifle.I am drowning, I am not a normal human being. I am so completely overcome with anxiety that I barely am able to function. I have a wonderful girlfriend that I have destroyed by being the way I am. There is absolutely no hope for me after trying therapy for over 5 years and only being told that there is no hope for me anymore.  I seem unable to fight the fear, the pain and the misery and therefore I am here. It probably won't help much as I have already come to an agreement with myself that if I am not any better when I hit 30, then I am not going to be here. 

I have realized these last 6 months that there is no beauty, safety, happiness, joy or anything good left in the world. There is only waking up in the mornings drenched in sweat and trying your best to feel a little less scared, a little more brave. I am rambling, the only thing I want is to not be a drain on society and my loved ones. Even here I am a drain to whoever bothers to read this. Nothing will ever change.",1

"I don't know anymoreI just needed somewhere to write something...

I sit there in the tub. The warm water surrounds my hips and legs, a slight contrast to the cold metal in the blade of my hand. I don't know how long I sat there looking at my left wrist asking myself, *""Are you gonna do it?""* The thought of death fascinated me more than scared me. I wasn't fascinated by the pain or anything, just by the blood, the way your heart rose and eventually fell, the way it would feel when I gave in and let my droopy eyelids fall for the last time. The eternal sleep. The freedom. The riddance of everyday's burdens. I lifted my right hand to my left arm and held the blade in place. *""Cut. Cut. Cut.""* My mind chanted over and over. I pushed the blade into my skin; this alone made a little drop pool around the edge of my blade. I **smiled** slightly. The pain felt good in a way. It was letting me know what was to come. I slowly and firmly pulled the blade along my skin. I repeated in the same spot a couple times. Then, I lowered my wrist into the water, Watching the blood fall from my wrist to the bottom of the tub was simply fascinating. I loved how... *peaceful* ... it looked. It drove me further, I made a few more cuts into into my arms and went over them a couple times as well. Each time the blade went across my skin more and more blood would come out. I couldn't keep track of how much blood I had lost because there was a steady inflow of water as there was draining. I had mastered the technique at a younger age to keep the water warm, it came in great handy now. Keeping my left wrist under the water, near the drain, I set the blade down on the ledge of the tub and rest my head on my knee. I could already feel the drowsiness coming on and it made me happy. I'd leave all this pain behind, once and for all. I shut my eyes and was done. It kinda was exactly like sleep. No dreaming or anything. When I woke up with bright fluorescent lights over my head and the smell of death and latex gloves all around me I realized it was only sleep. I closed my eyes and slept more. I was running away from the guilt I'd feel when I would see the sorrow in my parent's eyes... One day, I would have to put them through this again except I wouldn't wake up then.

"My life is improving and I'm happier and it makes me want to die moreMoved out from abusive home months ago, landed a good job, made amazing friends, experienced intimacy, vacationed and saw great things... but it's too foreign.

I'm happy but I'm not used to this. At the end of the day I feel strange and get extreme pangs of depression over these unfamiliar feelings. I keep feeling that I don't deserve it. I CRAVE the horrid lifestyle that I had before. I don't want to but I also want to be abused and neglected and constantly in a state of chaos. 

Went out in the city with one of my closest friends today, someone whom I still consider genuine, and even with we were together, eating, she and I laughing, I still felt the same way.

Ive romanticized the things in life I've wanted to experience and now I'm just disappointed I guess. I'm bored. There's nothing I want to stay for. Hobbies lose my interest quickly. I don't know. I don't think I could ever live normally. I just want to sleep forever.",1

"Ruining my family.So. I've been diagnosed with major depression, PTSD, and have been told that I may have Dissociative Identity Disorder. Yesterday, I told my single mum that I wanted to go meet my idols in Birmingham, UK. I live in Singapore. I wanted to go there on the 27th of February. They disagreed (which is sensible). I initially said I was ok with not going. But then I sensed something change within me, and I flipped out. I lost my shit, I went berserk. Started cutting myself, almost cut vertically. Blood was dripping. Argued with my mum, she broke down. Then I felt something change again, and I broke down crying as well. Then I felt something change AGAIN and I went all stone-faced. I didn't give a shit that she was crying. I just left the room. And then I fell asleep and woke up the next day feeling terrible. I don't know what's happening. I wanna die.",1

"My friend tried to kill himself. Details below.Alright I'm in alternative school for marijuana and I'm 15, my friend got caught with synthetic K2 and was supposed to be sent to alternative with me. Now he was molested at the age of about 6 and has been the main cause for most of his depression, which I think initially led him to smoking (we all have our reasons) but instead of coming to alternative school his parents sent him to a local drug rehab and mental health facility. A few days ago he tried to kill himself by hanging himself with his bedsheets. Luckily he was stopped but now he is going to stay there for the rest of school most likely. He has no contact with anyone outside. I was just wondering if there is anything I can do while he is in or after he gets out to help? Thanks.

"Where did all my friends go?2 years of isolation is all it took. Before that I was the big(tm) d e p r e s s o but had a loving support network. My best friend was always there for me. No matter what, it was unconditional, dropping anything in the world to be with me and make sure I was ok. One relationship later and I have cut off all connections with the people that were the closest to me, that took years to build connections with.

I feel that I was more loved and in love with my best friend than I ever was with my Ex. A love that was so pure, like a mother's love, that never let me fall too low -- low enough to want to die like I do now. Never did I have to impress them or make sure I was their favourite person. I just cared so much for them that no matter what happened I would be there for them.

There was no jealousy. No demands. No economic ties. No battles about having the same life goals. It was just a pure.

Why couldn't have that been my Ex? Why must love corrupt?

"Iâ€™m out of time to get better.At the beginning of June I was admitted to the hospital with suicidal thoughts, severe depression and anxiety. I came back to work after a week and a half and have missed several more days of work sense then. Iâ€™m now out of vacation/sick time and management is upset with me.  

This morning my depression is at an all-time high and all I can think about is how I am out of time to get better.   

Things have gone downhill. Today I withdrew from my classes (something Iâ€™ve never done before) and most of my assignments at work got reassigned to others because I was taking too long to complete them due to the excessive absences. People are upset over having to pick up the slack for me and Iâ€™ve never been able to handle others being angry with me.  

This kind of things has happened to me many times before. Iâ€™ve been diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder and have been on so many more medications over the years than I care to remember. Iâ€™ll go for years feeling healthy then, without warning, I crash and burn.  

This time I canâ€™t seem to pull myself out of this terrible rut. Iâ€™ve run out of my as needed anxiety meds a week early because I took them more than I should have. I canâ€™t get any work done at the office because Iâ€™m too busy crying and wondering if I have enough pills to put me to sleep so that Iâ€™ll never wake up.  

My boyfriend wants to take me back to the hospital but that wonâ€™t do any good. I canâ€™t miss more work and people are fed up with me because Iâ€™ve had more than enough time to get better.  

Iâ€™m not better though. And I have no one that I can go to for help. My boyfriend has too many other concerns and I would just needlessly worry my family who arenâ€™t really doing any better than I am.  

Iâ€™m worried that if I took every single pill in my possession, it still might not be enough. And I wouldnâ€™t want to live through it. I have no access to a gun. I feel so low and I donâ€™t see how anything will ever get better. I will always be unstable. Always just barely able to take care of myself.  

If I was gone, my boyfriend could find someone better. They could find someone else to do a better job at the office. I wouldnâ€™t bring everyone down any more. And I wouldnâ€™t hurt any more. I have nothing left to offer the world.  

But I donâ€™t know if I have enough pills. I donâ€™t want to wake up back in the hospital.",1

"End of my ropeHi, I’m eighteen and I just wanna start off by saying I have diagnosed depression. I’ve been taking meds for months now and lately it feels like they aren’t doing anything and I’ve felt like I’ve wanted to kill myself for a week now. I’ve attempted before, and I’ve done self harm a few times. Today I lost my only three friends, I got angry over something stupid at one of them and lashed out at the other two for it, now we’re beyond the point of kissing and making up. 

When I first started my meds I kept telling myself that my life can’t be given to anyone else now even if I don’t think I deserve it and even if I want to throw it away, but as of late I’ve stopped caring about that. I feel so burnt out and so worthless that it doesn’t matter to me anymore. I’ve also been stressed as hell for weeks, my brain is full of irrational thoughts and I’m constantly scared there are people going against me. I’ve been thinking things might just be easier if I slit both my arms open and let myself bleed out",1

I'm new to reddit, but I've been lurking for the past few months, but I wanted to post here because I just don't know anymore. I want people, even if strangers, to know my story.

My whole life has just been a lieu of pain. Childhood emotional abuse and mental abuse was at ever corner. Cops constantly visited my school to get me to go home with my mother at the end of day when I didn't want to. Middle school, high school, you name it. Left alone all the time so my social life was fucked from the beginning. Even after my parents divorce and my dad finally getting custody of me, the pain still didn't end. I was constantly put in a position of ridicule for not being into sports or something ""normal"". 

The one time I showed and displayed suicidal ideation, my father chucked my personal computer, that I paid for on my own, against the wall telling me I'm stupid and that I belong with all the other ""retarded"" patients in a mental hospital. I didn't want to go to hospital. So I've never been hospitalized.

I wish I was. I hate myself. I hate myself. I'm not good enough for anyone. I'm not great.

Recently my ""best"" friend pushed me out, and now she's just mean to me. I've done nothing to her. Now she's my ""ex"" friend. I feel forsaken. I don't know what I'm doing wrong. I don't have many friends at all. 

I just want to end it all today. I don't care anymore. The consequences I couldn't care less about. I'm just a college student with nothing going for them. My grades are falling. My love life is going to shit. My friends are leaving me. I want to isolate and die. 

I want to END it. I want this pain to go away. I want my friends to leave. I want my parents out. I don't care about funeral costs, I don't care about how other people feel. I don't really care. I won't ever get into medical school. I'll never be a psychiatrist. I'll never be a counselor. I'm nothing. I'm fucking ugly. All I fucking do is play Overwatch all day and hope I feel something. I play and main widowmaker. How ironic as that. 

Fuck my life. I just... should go away. I have nothing to contribute anyway to this fucking place.",1

"My family is probably the only reason why I haven’t kms yetI need to vent this somewhere, I can’t seem to find any other communities where this might fit into, and I sure as hell ain’t gonna talk to my family about it

I’m currently an RA in university and honestly I just don’t see the point anymore. I thought I would want to be a teacher maybe but I’ve found the only thing that I like to do is play video games — it’s the only thing that gives me true enjoyment. I hate everything else- I don’t like academics, I feel as if I died most of my friends wouldn’t care they feel fake as fuck to me, I haven’t had a single real relationship w a s/o my whole life, and I feel that ultimately everything won’t matter anyway because I’m gonna die alone anyway. Oh and because WW3 is about to start. 

The only reason I haven’t done anything drastic is because the only people that will miss me probably is my family. I have two moms, grandparents, and an aunt/two uncles that will miss me. I don’t have any siblings. 

If I didn’t have a supportive family, I almost certainly would be dead now. Every day gets harder and harder to keep pushing through. I don’t know how much longer I can do this. 

If u read this, thanks, I just needed to post this somewhere and let my feelings out somehow",1
"Tonight I will kill myselfAs of 2:45 AM on February 22nd i've started my first dose of tylenol with codeine I'm going to enjoy the ""buzz"" for an hourish before I up the doses. I wanted to post on here and let out everything because I cannot in my personal life kind of like a last message sort of thing. I decided to end it last night after my safe was broken into at my office and emptied with literally every piece of money I have to my name on wednesday (was switching banks and I dont have insurance on the money). In there was my rent, car payment, hydro, water phone everything so instead of being homeless and fucked I've came to the conclusion of ending it. I tried to contact my father for help but he hung up the phone on me ( we never had a relationship ) and I will not call my mother she's broke anyways but I was molested as a child by my older brother and she would never believe me and still treats him like a trophy its sickening and I was in the process of rebuilding my credit so a loan isnt an option totally fucked. I go to therapy for all my personal issues including that but other then my therapist I've never told anyone that. I'm 21 years old btw if anyone's wondering, I moved out on my own when I was 17 and have been on my own ever since. I had a beautiful caring girlfriend of 3 years but I ended it cause of my mental health. I suffer from depression, minor bi-polar, anxiety the whole shabang I've been handling it very well with meds but this just did it. I would like to say to the world thank you for the stay its been a wild ride and to my ex I hope this wont hurt you that much but if it does I will always love you and take care. To my brother ( not the bad one ) I know you will be the one that finds me I just want you to know I appreciate everything you've done for me and hope you can move on in life I know you will never forget me but just so you know I love you and take care of my cat or I will haunt you and sell all my stuff for the funeral.

"HELPIve been extremely depressed for nearly three years. I almost dropped out of highschool, but I managed to get into an alternative program, and I'm supposed to graduate this winter, 'only' a semester later than I should have. I had intelligence and so much potential, but it's all gone now. Just someone talk to me please, because I don't really want to die",1
"Scared of dying, tired of livingI'm fifteen, graduating from highschool in less than a month. The thing is, I'm not sure if I'll make it to my graduation day.

Everyday, it's always the same thing. It's all I can hear. ""You're fat."" ""You don't try hard enough."" ""Worthless."" ""Ugly.""

I've been staying in the same school since I was in preschool, so I'm a bit more sheltered than most teenagers. All my life, I have been hearing these words again and again on repeat. It hurts even more when my own flesh and blood says it to me.

My little brother is three years younger than me, so I try to understand it from his point of view. But no matter how I try, I can't fathom why he feels so happy when he calls me degrading names and makes me cry. He has even told me to kill myself a few times. I try to keep the tears in, but it only drowns me inside.

So I turn to cutting. At first, I didn't understand why people would cut themselves. Then I realized that when I cut, the physical pain blocks my emotional pain and for awhile, I forget. I let go. But it's only for awhile and then it comes crashing down to me again. Why did I do that? Now I will forever have these scars. Then I vow to myself never to cut again.

Except I did.

And now I can't even turn to my friends, because everytime I even try to talk to them, they're talking about something that I can't relate to, and I feel so out of place.

My dad and his lover don't really care. They'll scold my brother when he antagonizes me, but that's it. Now he's got the idea that it's okay to abuse me, since that's what my dad used to do to mom when they were still together.

Day by day, my cuts get deeper. One day, I might cut too deep. And sometimes, I wish I do. Then I get scared of dying.

But would it be really such a bad thing to die when it would only bring me out of my misery?",1

"Looking for some adviceEugh so not sure if this really belongs here but to be honest I dont really care that much, I just need to ask somebody (even if it is some random strangers on the internet :P ). So basically alot of my friends want to die. Some have tried, some just want to, and well some just cut (although its not a just but its got so bad that cutting is a lesser of the evils?( oh god....( I like brackets :P ) ) ) 3 of my friends have tried to kill themselves multiple times, one 3 times, one 7 times, and the other well I dont think even she knows how many times she has tried. And its getting really fucking tiring. I myself feel shit alot but if you have heard of the stages of change I am at pre contemplation at the moment (even if I do infact see a psychologist) and I am just shit at letting people know I feel like crap, so I try to be cheery and such and smile and I like to think I am good at it :) anyway I am getting side tracked, a few of my other friends help out with the people who feel bad but its simply too much to manage and cope with school life and all that (my grades dropping and such). Basically everyone we have turned to for help has provided fuck all. We managed to convince pretty much everyone to see the school psychologist at some point or other and all the school did was tell them it was a phase or inform the parents who were more often than not part of the problem (sure it could be a stage just convinently these people had been diagnosed with depression and had cut for a year so I am pretty certain its a bit more serious than that). I am convinced that most parents dont give a fuck about their kids, or just does no one actually care? What do I do? I cant cope with the fear that someone will try again and this time be successful. Even worse I worry if one person goes it will all collapse and I will just see all of my friends die around me. Haha I just cant cope with it, I am 15 for fucks sake and I thought the adults were supposed to help with this? But we are on our own, and its so hard to balance it all and not die myself. Where can I find help? What do I do?",1

"I'm tied of being unwanted.Really it's just bullshit to wake up everyday and face another day alone. No one is in your corner really, they are just looking out for themselves. I hate volunteering, working and doing stuff. Everywhere you go it's just users. I've never really been wanted. After my dad died my mom walked out on me. She never really spoke to me again until the day she died. I've never been able to get a good job because I'm always rejected by them. It's always a job that barely pays enough to live on. I never have the ability to save up to go do something fun. Even if I did I wouldn't have anyone to do it with. I've always been rejected by women too. Every girl I've asked out has rejected me. It's just bullshit. I'm tired of life going nowhere and I'm tired of being alone all the time. All I wanted was to start another family. That's impossible with as little money as I make and the fact that I've been rejected by every woman I've asked out. 

So fuck it, I'm going to hang myself. People won't tell you that you're not wanted here, they will even lie to you and tell you they want you here but in reality, I know I'm unwanted. It's time to die and get out of everyone else's way. I'm sick of the attitudes I get anyway. ",1

I have no motivation to move out of my parents' house and do something. I have no motivation at all. So I might as well make everyone's life easier by eliminating a problem.

I don't feel depressed right now, I'm just starting to think it's in the best interest. Like I've never had sex and I probably never will. I'm wasting everyone's fucking time right now. I just wish suicide wasn't so difficult to reach because of regulations.",1

All i know for a fact is that no one will care when i'm gone. Most of my ""friends"" no longer talk to me or help me when i need them. My family doesn't care about my wellbeing either, always leaving me to fend for myself, no matter how miserable i feel.

"What’s wrong with me why does he treat me this way? It’s because I’m so ugly?[what I look like](https://imgur.com/a/V1JQN91)

I feel like no one will ever want me. I was teased in high school told I look forty and that I have wrinkles. When I was 16 some older guys took me to a party. I got drunk and blacked out one of them had sex with me and I’ve talked to him five years since on and off . Him and his friends said I was a sl*t after the first time because I think they did other things but I blacked out.


He’s older he sleeps with a lot of other girls. He’s cheated on almost all of his girlfriends. He says I’m not attracted enough to date. When I was 16 after having sex with me he told people I was the grossest women he’s been with. He said he will never want to date me he wants me for sex and nothing more


He wouldn’t really hang out with me or talk with me he would get what he wants and leave. Then ignore me for a few days. He told me not to tell people we hookup. He makes comments about my weight constantly. I have no self  esteem I think I’m the ugliest person I know . My eyes are too close. I have fat cheeks. I look 40 years old.

He dates other girls and says super nice stuff about them online introduces them to his mom and friends. Ever since what happened when I was 16 I’m not welcome with his friends they say I’m weird. He’ll get a girlfriend and either text me after a month or wait six then blow up my phone.

He keeps photos he took of me some years ago that are sexual. I think to make fun of me because I look like a monster I’m so horrid looking. He’ll send them to me saying don’t you miss this. He’ll get really upset when I ignore him then when I talk to him he rubs his girlfriend in my face. Does this guys use me for sex because I’m ugly? I know it’s true

If only I wasn't such a fucking failure of a human being, huh. If only I knew how to keep a conversation going. If only I knew how to talk to new people. If only I could get enough sleep to actually listen in school. If only I didn't basically have panic attacks in the middle of the hallway because there are too many people around. If only I wasn't constantly anxious about having all the possible mental and physical illnesses in the book. If only I wasn't bi and trans. If only I had a relationship with my dad whom I live with. If only the one person who I feel like actually gives a shit about me in this world didn't live 700km away.

"What's the pointWhen I was 16 my girlfriend convinced me that if I really wanted to end my life so badly to wait a year and if in a years time I still wanted to then do it because its clearly what I really do want, i took an entire bottle of sleeping pills on my birthday a year later and woke up in the hospital and had to spend weeks in pretty much a mental institution. 4 years later I feel the same way. My life has completely fallen apart, In highschool I was ""the guy who could get the best blow, extacy , weed whatever, my friends where pretty much return customers who would come over and get high at my place because they couldn't at home. But anyways a year ago I'd say I hit rock bottom, I moved out and went off to college, I spent the entire year so fucked up I barley remember what happened. I started missing school to stay home and get wasted I hardly saw anyone accept my violent acholic roommates who would only try to start fistfights with me. My girlfriend started coming around less and less and eventually left me telling me she would have left me earlier if she wasnt so terrified of me because of the violent pyscopath i had aparently become. These where the people I grew up with and I thought where my best friends treating me like shit day after day. I guess something in me snapped because I sold off the last of my blow and what have you and bought a motorcycle thinking id meet new people, it would take my mind off things and I could kind of... Start over. So I bought a motorcycle decided to take a year off and ""find myself"" or whatever. Since then I've just been scraping along the bottom of the barrel. Its been over a year since Ive spoken to anyone I consider a ""friend"" I didn't meet anyone on my motorcycle going to meets or whatever I'm like only one even close to 20 who seems to own one in all of Canada. I've pretty much been sitting in the same room playing the same video games alone without a single person to talk to for over a year now. I can't take it anymore I'm losing my mind. I rather end it all then know I have to wake up to another day of this. I just feel so fucking pathetic I don't know what to do, I'm not looking for sympathy or a reply and I'm sure this won't even make sense this is just the closest I've come to being able to talk to someone in a long time and I just needed to let it out. And no I can't ""talk to someone"" because my degree involves heavy machinery and I was told if I ""ever did anything like this again"" the first time I tried to kill myself I'd be blacklisted from working around anything I could hurt myself or others while operating. I'm just so fucking fed up I can't even talk to people anymore, whenever I do talk to someone its like an instinct to just push them away because their only trying to use me for something.

"I feel like its not gonna changeI am a 16 year old guy.

my whole story starts years ago when i was brought to my friends youth group, it was awesome i met a few really cool people and i decided to keep going there. a few years go by and i still attend this youth group. i became really close with who i consider the biggest role model of my whole life, the intern speaker. 

before i was 15 my life was great. me and all my friends were super close and it was great. then i made the stupidest decision of my life i changed schools. i became really anti social not having a familiar face in my school, i even skipped some of my classes which i have never done.

the intern speaker who i looked up to so much was getting married which was amazing news, then he said he got a full time job as a youth speaker... 6 hours away. 

thats when i realized all my friends and everyone i knew was moving forward in their lives and im still me from 2 years before. not even changed, i got in a fistfight with my bestfriend of 12 years cause i need to grow up.

i also saw that all my friends had a girl in there lives and i still had no one.

lets fastforward to now, ive had the best weekend me and my friends went up to the old intern speakers house and we all agree it was the bes tweekend of our lives. then i got home and now everything has hit me at once, everyone is moving forward with their lives and im still 14. everything in m life has changed but me, my dog has died and i still go about my day as if she were still here.

i cant even get my point across to you through words im just confused.",1

"Feeling of being done, ready to endI don't know why I'm posting here. Maybe I'm trying to avoid the hospital again, maybe I want to be convinced somehow. I just feel like I'm done with life. Things aren't getting better for me. Moreover, I'm bored. I'm bored of the normal stuff: jobs, eating, sleeping. I'm bored of specialized activities: computers, sports, etc. I feel as though no one wants to be my friend and I don't blame them, I feel like even if I had friends I would still feel like this, which is sad, not too long ago I thought loneliness was the problem and that I would feel better if I just reconnected with people, but now I don't feel like that at all. What use is there? Why do I feel like people are kidding themselves when they have stuff to look forward to, or aren't suicidal in general? I think there is just something fundamentally different in my brain that wants to go away forever. Normal people don't feel like this. Death seems peaceful. Who knows though.",1

* **Prevent hot flashes:** Some women find wearing socks helpful for cooling their core body temperature.
* **Improve cracked heels:** Wearing cotton socks after you moisturize can help keep your heels from drying out.
* **Increase potential orgasms: According to the** [**BBC**](https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/4111360.stm)**, researchers accidentally discovered that wearing socks increased participantsâ€™ ability to achieve an orgasm by 30 percent.**
* **Decrease chance of Raynaudâ€™s attack:** Raynaudâ€™s disease is when affected areas of the skin, usually the toes and fingers, lose circulation and start to throb or swell. Wearing socks at night can help prevent an attack by keeping your feet warm and blood circulating.",0

"Dreams are stupid Can we talk about how dreams are unbelievably stupid? A few days ago, I had a dream where me and the more athletic version of my sisterâ€™s boyfriend from two years ago were in the street in front of my house. It was dark outside and the only light was a dim street light thatâ€™s on the corner of my house. We were confronted by a mixed race Michael Cera, wearing a basketball jersey, holding up a sign saying,â€Iâ€™m not racistâ€. He then rips part of the sign that says â€œnotâ€, and as you guessed it reads out,â€Iâ€™m racistâ€. He then runs towards us and we start fighting back. Except in my dream, I jumped onto his back to sorta disable him and my sisterâ€™s boyfriend is the one beating him up. We then beat him up to the point where heâ€™s a tiny person, and we poke his eyes out. Then all of a sudden, weâ€™re inside holding a tiny, frail baby that looks like it was boiled in water. So of course, I didnâ€™t go back to sleep after that. Needles to say, I donâ€™t know wtf my dreams are anymore.",0

"ConfessionI just want to let people know. Especially those over 25. I never wanted to grow up and it never has and never will appeal to me. With that, I want y'all to know that some of us just want to be 18 forever. I don't want to be like you. I don't like you. Not everyone wants to suck their boss' cock for the rest of their life. Some of us just want to have fun and be young that is it. I'm saying this cause I'm sick of people wanting me to be mature. I'm a 22 year old freshmen and I just want the experience of an 18 year old. That's all I'm asking. I don't want my college experience to be different. Just respect my wishes. I like my 18 year old freshmen roommates and you know what, lying about my age has done wonders and if you have an issue with it, that's your problem. Lying about my age has allowed me to be a kid again; I don't want to be an adult. I want to be a normal college kid. There's a reason why I hate being around older college students even though I'm technically am one. I hate people and definately those who are ""mature"". So to sum it all off, I don't live to get a job. I live to be youthful and fun. So to those especially who have surrendered to adulthood to simply fuck off. ",1

"I have never felt more suicidalLast week my dog nearly died and was in and out of the animal hospital costing me $1000 I don’t have. I am behind on school work because I was taking care of her so I am stressed to the max. Then this week my bf broke up with me. And I have been so stressed out I can’t eat or sleep or breathe. I have been vomiting to the point of passing out and hospitalization.

Every object I see is a way to kill myself. I walk into the bathroom and I want to hang myself with the shower curtain. I walk into the kitchen. And I want to stab myself. I walk to my car and I want to jump into in coming traffic. Any heavy object I want to pick up and smash my head in. Every medication I debate dumping the whole bottle down my throat. When I’m not hyperventilating while doing homework I’m crying.

I have no one. I was in the hospital alone and the doctors insisted someone drive me home so I pretended I had a ride so I could leave. They told me someone needs to monitor my condition so I told them that someone would. But I lay here alone shaking on the ground hoping and praying to any deity that might exist that I may die. 

I have never wanted to die this bad not even when I attempted suicide before. It hurts too bad and I am utterly alone.",1
"People don't understandI'm a teen mom. I get it im stupid for keeping my son who I love. I get help from his father and his family. But not from mine. I ask my roommates and my own mother to help me, they say I can do it myself. My son is a squirmed and it takes about ten minutes to put one diaper on. To get him dressed about 20 minutes. All I am asking for is a little help so he doesn't get poop everywhere or squirms out my hands and falls. Is that so hard to ask for?! I recently discovered I'm depressed again, they see it. But do nothing to make it easier. There suppose to be my friends and my own mother, but it feels like there not even there. I lost my best friend 4 months ago to suicide and it still hurts. She was the one who always knew how to help me. I have no one to help me emotionally. And it sucks.

"I don't feel betterIf anything I feel worse. I want so much to die that it is unbelievable. I've been doing a lot of research on how painful it would be to OD on my sleeping meds. (Diphenhydramine for those interested) I just miss her so much and I'm never going to get her back and I just can't take that. I can see my funeral better then I can see my college life. She broke me and I can't put myself back together. Any time I do I just look at myself and realize how wrong it is. She was my everything she made me so happy and now thinking of her only fills me with dread. I just wish that I would never have existed. So many people's lives would be better. My only reason for not doing anything is because my mom is pressuring me not to by saying that if I kill myself then she will follow leaving my sister alone. But why do I have to live for others? Everyone says suicide is selfish but I'd say that forcing someone to live a life they don't want to live for your own reasons is equally selfish.

"It’s all becoming too much.I’m not necessarily the most suicidal person, but shit’s been getting worse and worse, I’m not sure how long I’m gonna last. I really just need a place to let it all out. This is gonna be a long one.

One of my closest friends goes through a lot, and he has a lot of mental disorders. I know it’s really hard for him, and I really feel bad and wish I could help more. I try, I really do, but I always end up feeling worthless. I know I can’t fix it, but I want to try and at least distract him from the pain. He talks about suicide and self-harm a lot, and I have a really hard time talking about stuff like that because of my own personal shit. I try and take it anyways because I wanna be there for him if he needs to vent. I’m so scared of losing him, I don’t know what to do. I’ve considered killing myself to avoid the pain when he eventually commits suicide, because at this point, I feel like I’m a burden to him. I’m so anxious to ask him if anything’s wrong, and I feel completely worthless because of it. I can’t stand the thought of losing him, he’s literally made me so damn happy and I feel so bad I can’t do the same for him. Im so selfish trying to prevent him from killing himself because he’s in a ton of mental pain. I don’t want to leave him and abandon him, and I feel like if I tell him this myself, he’ll cut himself. I don’t want him to hurt himself or worry about me, but everything is becoming too much for me to take in. I tell him I care for him, but it probably doesn’t mean much to him. Every day, I fucking pray that he’s alive and didn’t kill himself at night. I’m so scared what’ll happen when he’s finally gone. I just wish i were better. I want to be there for him, but I’ll never be enough.

I decided to kill myself when he does, because I literally have nothing left to live for once he’s gone. I know it’s gonna happen one day, may be tonight, may be in a couple years, but I know it’s gonna happen.",1

I’ve been struggling w depression and sleep deprivation for weeks ever since my girlfriend left me for a job in a different state. I think I might’ve aggravated the situation by trying my hardest to find a compromise. I couldnt pull it off. Nothing works. I’m too scared to be alone again. People like me dont get many chances at happiness and I feel like that was my last shot. My friends left me because they feel like im prioritising saving this relationship more than their feelings. People keep leaving me and hurting me and im so sick of it. I just wish i could forget about literally everything and start anew. On some days i just wish my heart would just stop in my sleep. I dont want to live anymore.,1
"Why are you still around?I asked this another sub but didn’t really get anything, so I’m trying again here. I’m looking for reasons to stick around, at least for a little while. I originally planned to commit this month, but im not sure if I’m totally ready yet despite how badly I want to go. I know I’ll do it eventually, unless my depression and anxiety and ptsd somehow gets cured and I actually start enjoying being around. But until then, I’m looking for things to do to make me want to live.

Some songs make me want to go on adventures or sit on a roof and watch the stars or dance with a partner, but those things will never happen. I’m just sixteen and have overprotective parents so I’d have to wait until I move out to do anything worth while, for now it’s just school and homework and hating myself and being alive. Some books make me want to stick around, too.

I’m sorry I sound so whiney and crappy and stuff in this post, just feeling pretty bad today and want to figure out how to enjoy my existence a bit more. What keep you guys around? I can’t really think of many good reasons to stay, except for the obvious “my family/friends will be sad and angry” and “my dog will be sad” but I want solutions, things to make my life more livable.

"I'm just really fatigued and want/need some way to move onI feel like my whole life I've been unhappy with who I am and what I can do. Of all the things I know I can do, I know I can write music, but I just don't show it off, and I don't feel proud of what I'm able to write/create. I want to create something meaningful but its just so nasty. I'm close to graduating with a bachelors in philosophy, and it's useless in a practical sense. A lot of the time I consider buying a gun and blowing my brains out, but I just wish I wasn't such a coward. I want to play my music. It's really pathetic to complain about this shit on the internet, none of my heroes would do this.

I would never kill myself as far as I know, but then again, I really don't love or respect myself. I think the real reason I express my fear and discontent is because I don't think I'll really be happy unless I'm successful musically, which is statistically ridiculous.

EDIT: Just realized this post may not be suited to this subreddit in particular, but in my drunkenness, I really don't know any other subreddits to post to, so forgive me and point me in the right direction. Again, I apologize and my position towards suicide is much more complicated than ""I am or I'm not."" I'm really more scared and self-hateful than I am personally able to let on, so again I apologize if my post draws from others' needs and attention.",1

"Need Help for my friendHello everyone. So I have a friend who is gay, and he is really going through a tough time. I am also gay, and unfortunately I am one of the few people he is close with that he can talk to about his sexuality that will understand him. He is constantly having to deal with his homophobic family, as not only is his relationship with his parents rough, but his mother and father seem to be (at least by what he's told me) on the edge of divorce. Another big issue is he is very depressed and he seems to have certain days where he is really... upset to say the least. [Messages like these](http://imgur.com/kqIhoAI) and talks of self harm have become more frequent and he just seems to be getting worse each time. We tend to skype a lot, and I can tell just by his voice that he's having more troubles. I myself have never had depression, and I can't really relate to anything that he is going through. This makes it particularly hard for me, as it seems he tends to come to me when he needs to talk to someone and most of the time, I just don't know what to respond with. And this kills me on the inside, as he is coming to me for help, someone he trusts, and I'm sure for him it just appears that I don't want to talk about it. I was wondering if anyone had any advice for me or him, because I hate to see him like this. Any advice would be greatly appreciated :)",1

Absolutely, positively, fucking, done.I can’t sleep at night because I get RLS whenever I try and then wake up 10 times because of night terrors if I do manage to fall asleep so I’m tired literally all the time. I have zero goals in life, nothing I enjoy doing besides going home and playing video games, nothing I wanna go to college for, no job that I want, my grades are terrible and my parents called me a disappointment, everyone nonstop shit talks me, I might have gotten hacked recently, the few friends I have are overshadowed by the literal dozens of people who hate me and think I’m a toxic piece of shit, I’ve driven so many people away, Im a shitty boyfriend because my girlfriend always wants to go out and do stuff with me but I just want to stay at home and have her come over (or go to her house), one of my long distance friends committed suicide, I’m a shitty friend and usually take excruciatingly long amounts of time to respond to anyone who texts me, I’m even getting sick of playing video games and am slowly being overcome entirely by boredom and spend all day in bed because I have nothing to do, can’t hang out with friends in groups outside of school because I feel like such an unnecessary faggot that isn’t important to the group because they’d be having just as much fun without my pathetic ass, ex gf molested and cheated on me and lied to all of her fitness so now all of her friends think I’m a false rape claimer and I get shit talked for it, slowly yet surely disassociating myself with the world around me and I’m passing through everyday life in a trance feeling nothing but an overwhelming sadness, crippling self harm addiction out of a desire to feel something other than sadness so I can know I’m still alive while also wanting to punish myself as severely as possible for being such an annoying toxic piece of shit, hear voices and hallucinate extremely often to the point I think I might need to go to a psychiatrist but I’m too scared to tell my parents, I’ve tried to kill myself by hanging but failed because the shitty door mounted pull up bar I was using broke, etc etc.

I want to die. I want nothing but to die. I want everyone around me to hate me because the only reason I’m still alive is because I know they’d be sad if I died, but there’s no coming back from this. There’s no getting better. I’m in too deep, I already know it’s only going to get worse. I can’t talk to therapists or anyone like that because I don’t trust them and talking about my issues only seems to make them worse. I’m getting worse and worse by the day and I’m 15 pounds underweight because I can’t even be bothered to eat food half the time anymore. My literal only hobby brings me almost no enjoyment anymore and I don’t get to see my girlfriend as often as I’d like. I just want it to be over. So so so fucking bad. I haven’t been able to stop crying for like a full ass half hour and it’s not stopping. This is my life. I’m miserable all the time and have nothing I want to do with my life and it’s getting worse and worse by the day, and I can’t even pussy out of it because it would destroy my family and few friends beyond repair, so I just have to live with it.

"my life is great but I'd rather dieI'm a 16 year old female. My life is good, I am doing amazingly at school, I have a couple of close friends I can talk to, I go out and do usual teenagery things. I feel so privileged compared to most people on this sub. I'm so excited for my future, to go to uni and get a good job. My family life isn't good- disabled mum and borderline abusive sister (she used to be much worse) but I can deal with that now, my sister could be trashing my room and I can just sit with a straight face and let it not bother me. Despite my life being good and not being more sad than a usual person- i can't shake off these suicidal thoughts I've been having since I was a child. A couple of months ago, I attempted suicide, ended up in ICU for a few days, got discharged and got seen by the children's mental health service. Okay cool- had a few appointments, opened up about everything and virtually told that there was nothing wrong with me despite saying that I thought I was still at risk.


Everyday, I always think of killing myself no matter what mood i'm in, I could be ecstatic and just think 'wouldn't this be a great moment to end it'. It's a record player in my head, every few days or so i'll fantasize about a different method I could use. Despite looking forward to the future i'm more excited to die. Now I know that I am capable of attempting, it gives me more strength to do it again and hopefully succeed. ",1

My god my god I want to die from so much colic that I feel this merfda,0
"I feel as if I was always a lost cause.It’s the very early morning, I’ve been up because of how volatile my emotions are tonight. 

First off, I admit that I never was in an average environment. I was born and raised in the Jehovah’s Witnesses, a high control religious group, every aspect of my life was decided from the start. Everything from length of hair, to no holidays, to willingly following the organizations orders, no matter how peculiar. While I witnessed the damaging effects that a strict religion that values conformity has on others, I never saw what it had on me.

I developed a severe paranoia from many of the practices in the group. I was constantly told the world can end any second, leading to a sense of dread and worry. I was also told that I could be deemed “not good enough” once Armageddon came, leading to extreme guilt for anything deemed “worldly” and a belief I was never enough. Alienation was another factor, given I couldn’t participate in holiday or birthday events with other children.

At the same time, I was often beat up by my older cousins, for little to no reason.  Being young, I was afraid of admitting I was the target of bullying. My cousins would often threaten me if I spoke ill of them or their actions. Given the tight-knit nature of their immediate family, I was always outnumbered in terms of placing my word against theirs. 

Both of these problems were eventually removed from my life. I left the Witnesses, despite how strict rules regarding apostates are.  I graduated early, distancing myself from any unnecessary social conflict such as my cousins. Despite the fact these problems are in the past, I know they affect me to this day. 

Concern for my mental health was first expressed during middle school, and up until 10th grade, cultivated. Soon, I was required to see a professional before returning, due to multiple counselors diagnosing me with severe depression. I always felt a little more serious and cold than my peers, but I never knew it was that serious.  I decided to pursue homeschool and graduated within 6 months. 

Regardless, I see how damaging I was to others before I left school. I was unpleasant, I was depressing and still am cynical. I did make mistakes, such as rushing into relationships, and dismantling friendships out of a fear of betrayal.

After years of being taught to not trust anyone outside of my religion, years of being a punching bag for my cousins, and earning myself a bad reputation for having a shaky mental health; I can safely say I’ve retreated into a sunken place. My compulsions are relentless, my suicidal thoughts are often fueled by paranoid thoughts and I can’t even drive or get a job, I’m too damn anxious. All of this makes it hard to maintain any friendships, due to my own imperfections. While I wish to become a musician, I’ve always seen myself dying a young death. I feel as if I’m running out of time, before my past and mind get the best of me. It almost feels as if there’s no chance of having a pleasant life due to my mental health.",1
"Contemplating suicideNot going to try and make things poetic. 

I'm a massive cunt and I'm sick of hitting the people around me 

I just want it to stop. 

This has been something I have thought long and hard over the last few months and hasn’t been a decision I made lightly. 

I have come to terms with the fact that while my death may cause some pain in the short term, overall, I will save everyone the long-term pain of dealing with my future grievances. 

Mum, I love you so much. You have always been a kind and supportive voice no matter how hard the circumstances, please understand there was nothing you could have done to help me and I will love you forever. 

Dad, you are my biggest role model. I have always looked up to you and I never want you to blame yourself for my failure. I will always love you.

Sam, while I may of had difficulty expressing it while we lived together, I truly do love you and wish you all the luck in the world. My estate should be left to you, I trust you will do right by Rowan but then feel free to use any capital I have acquired to the best of your ability. 

Rowan, you are my soul mate. I can feel that you are the one I was meant to be with and I am so grateful for the years we have spent together. I only wish i could of treated you better, you deserved it. I will always love you. 

Sean, Pat, Sam Joe &amp; Dom. In sorry, I love you all. Live good lives and be better men than me. 

To whoever’s finds my body, I am so sorry.

"DoneLife is too hard. Living is just too hard to keep going.  And after 32 years of pain and suffering, I feel like it’s time to just end it.
 
I really wish someone could convince me that life is worth living, but its not really possible to convince me, because life is just not.  

Let’s call it like it is. Let’s call a spade a spade. I’m an ugly, worthless, fat ass piece of shit loser.

I’m not worth dating. My ex wouldn’t even put in the effort to hang out with me and started dating someone before we even broke up. I continue to let myself be manipulated by him, and waiting for him to pay me back the $3k he owes me, making me keep in contact with him while I see him dating other people. Killing myself will end that debt and end me having to see my money go to him spending it on dates. 

Before that my only relationship of 10 years really consisted of someone who was sexually aggressive, would constantly pressure me to have sex, and while we broke up, he still manipulated me so I wouldn’t date other people.  Now he’s happy and successful and I’m shit. 

I’m just so fucking ugly and fat that no one else would want to date me, or people go on one fucking date with me and ghost me, because I’m so much of a loser. Every gay dating app there is, reminds me that no one wants me. I’m a fucking piece of ugly shit.

The thing is I don’t want to do anything. I’m a lazy piece of shit and don’t really care to lose weight. I’d rather just end it. It’s too much work to go to the gym and try to lose weight.  It’s too much work to change my eating habits. I’d rather just die already.   

I’m in so much debt and bad with credit cards. I have no desire to learn how to pay them back. So much so I know I will never be able to get a house or other big loans.

I hate my job right now, and have never really enjoyed any work that I do.  My coworkers don’t do fucking shit, and are fucking lazy as well, and I’m having to take on their work because I’m more efficient than they are. I don’t want to work. I just wanna lie in bed til I die to be honest. 

I’m honestly just tired of hearing that things will get better, because that’s a fucking lie. 32 years of living on this earth have proved to me that things don’t get better. Yes, there may be moments of happiness, but those are few and far between for me.  And honestly, they are not worth the pain I have to deal with every. Single. Fucking. Day.  Pain of having to be alive, while just constantly thinking about killing myself.  I have physical pain and stress on my body. 

Now really is the best time. My family is in another state, and have two other great sons. I have a couple friends, but they are happily coupled and deservedly so, they plan on moving on, and we are drifting apart. So really the fewest people in my life would be affected. While I’m sorry to those that are, I feel like this is what is best for me. 

I’ve tried to be happy, and it just doesn’t work. I am taking medications, talking to therapists. It hasn’t helped. Or maybe at one point in my life it did, but now I see the truth that my life is fucking shit. 

I am hoping to kill myself this weekend, or at the very least take some steps to put this plan in motion

"I don't know how much longer I can go, but I hope my posting history will help someoneI'm that cliche trans story about being ""a girl in a boy's body"" as long as I can remember, as young as 4. At night I used to pray for god to let me ""come back as a girl"" in another life. While I was never explicit about it, as if I knew it wasn't normal, through little things I said or did I think my parents could tell there was something wrong with me, and so they always pushed me to anything more masculine. 

It didn't affected me much through my childhood. At a certain point I even forgot about this wish, and when asked why I was so shy I didn't even know the answer myself. It wasn't until I was 14 that I begun to make sense of these feelings, figuring out at that age that I was different and doomed for a life of suffering was overwhelming and it's not a time I like to remember. Ever since, 10 years later, my life has been a mess. I have had no friends since, I never participated in any normal activities teenagers or young adults do like hanging out with friends, partying, going to the movies by themselves. I was always the perfect child to my parents, I had great grades and never gave them any reason to complain, but during the time I needed them the most they failed me. Back then, had I started hormone therapy, maybe I would've had a chance at life. 

Despite all of this, I still went to college because my parents wanted it. I choose a course I love, but due to depression I never could enjoy it. It was an extension of high school for me, I was the weirdo who barely talked. I saw normal girls experimenting with their styles, having fun, getting coveted internships while I had to keep still in my cocoon. I was so miserable, I didn't bothered getting connections or doing the most on each assignment. Despite graduating, it all felt like a waste, another experience I could not live to the fullest because I was disgusted with myself, because I wasn't the girl I saw myself as. 

On the final year of college I still had hopes and dreams. I thought for sure my parents would appreciate my effort, and maybe they would help me transition, and maybe a year later I would be able to finally start living my life. I remember looking at the Royal College of Arts website, imagining continuing my studies there as a girl, being able to be myself for the first time. I would also look at this famous office in my area based in the same city, can you imagine how amazing it would be to intern there while I studied? I had online friends who studied abroad and lived exciting lives, I thought I could finally be like them.

I did everything my parents wanted. I behaved, I never gave them trouble, I had good grades, I was respectful. Then I went to college and graduated. And again, when I needed them the most they failed me. That magical year filled with transformations before a daring move abroad never happened. It's been almost 4 years now, and those years are a blur, I have not worked, studied or did anything since. I gave up and did absolutely nothing during them, because I know that my life is over. 

By now my body and face have been ruined by puberty, if I tried to transition now I would never look like a woman, it would ruin my relationship with my parents, if not outright kill them with sorrow and disgust, and it would be like having a target on my back. I don't want to be trans, I want to be a normal woman. I want to be myself, have my own style and preferences, to have friends, experience love, have a beautiful wedding, start a family with children of my own.  

The guilt and shame of the wasted past 4 years kill me everyday. My parents are so worried I will not be able to take care of myself when they pass. I really wanted to make them proud, I really fucking did and I tried to get them to help me achieve that, but they wouldn't hear me. My father found me a therapist almost two years ago, but that didn't helped. He even sent me to this woman who does some kind of regression therapy with massages, which unsurprisingly didn't helped (though the massage felt really good). He just needs to put on a show so he can say he tried everything.

Right now I feel frozen with fear, as each path I follow will only lead me and my family into tragedy and suffering. I can suck it up, get a shitty job and be independent while accepting I'll never get to be myself, I'll always be an alien at the sidelines and leading a depressing unfulfilling life, which in turn will make my parents miserable and would likely end with me killing myself. Or I can transition and as I described be a failure, ruin my family and my life and either killing myself or being a victim of violence. Or I can just kill myself now, which would also destroy my family. What would you do? 

The more I think about it, the more I realize I was doomed from the start. Even if I transitioned early I would still not be normal like other girls, dating would be difficult and I would never be able to have children, which was always my dream. Why does anyone has to be born like this? I just hope the last few years of my posting history won't be completely to waste. I hope they can help someone who's going through a similar situation and help them get help before it's too late.",1

&amp;#x200B;

She sauntered into the room, her enormous breasts swaying from side-to-side like a great grandfather clock, glistening enticingly, her massive nipples clinging to the underside of the latex bra she just happened to be wearing at 2 PM on a Monday evening.

The throbbing mounds that adorned her colossal melons seemed as if to emit a high-pitched grown. A dog whistle of sorts. A siren call that made my 18-inch penis immediately stand at attention like a marine in the dog house.

I stumbled over to her, my massive shaft swaying from side-to-side, rocking the whole house with it. Upon closer inspection, her giant conkers were even more impressive that I'd first thought. Sprinkled lightly with freckles, like a perfectly peppered biscuit, she had the most beautiful bongos I'd ever gazed upon.

I let out a primal yell and immediately entered her, causing her to spout cum violently before completing the first thrust. We were still clothed. Such was the power of my immense man meat that I penetrated her clothing and simultaneously found entrance to her clitoris. Like climbing some massive mossy meat mountain, I erected my shaft at the top and declared victory. This wasn't my first sexual encounter. I've had sex with at least 9 other women. Still, something about this one was special.

Still inside her, I could feel her ovaries trembling. My gigantic cock had curled inside her like fruit by the foot, now spurting from her mouth as if a great cum-fountain. 

""You like that bebe?"" I grumbled.

Her nipples gazed at me with lust and thirst.

I spent the rest of the afternoon tenderizing her meat oven with my man hook.",0
"How do I open up to a friend?Hey everyone!

I’m an 18 year old guy who has been dealing with depression and suicidal thoughts for several years now, and have finally decided I want to do something about it. A lot of people have said you need to ‘open up’ to people about it, and that this is the first step in getting better. However, I have a couple questions about this:

1. What does ‘opening up’, or telling others about your issues actually do? What benefits does it bring?

2. How do you have this conversation? I’d feel uncomfortable just bringing up that I’m suicidal with my friends.

3. What should I expect my friend to provide? I can just imagine telling my friend about my problems, and him just not knowing what to do

So, as you can probably tell from my username, I'm depressed and want to die. My mother hates me but I can't move out as I'm unemployed and can't afford rent. She takes everything out on me and kicked me out of the house for a while earlier, threatening to call the police on me. I have one person in life who I can rely on and that's my boyfriend, he's the only reason I hadn't killed myself yet.

But tonight was the straw that broke the camel's back, I had a shit day, I went up to a bridge that's quite well known for suicides in my city (I'm in the UK) and there's a help point for the Samaritans charity, I pressed it and there was no answer (I think it was disconnected or broken).

I stood at the very top of this bridge and thought ""what if"", what if I actually phoned my boyfriend, said goodbye and did it, I overcame the urge and came home.

Then it all kicked off with my mum, I just want to end it but I don't want to hurt the guy I love with all my heart. I'm torn.

It probably won't be happening tonight. I hate myself for it but I don't think I can do it a month sooner than I expected",1
"To the one quietly contemplating what he would miss.I was like you once. 
I had no vision of any overseable future. I was blind to life and what it presented me with. I was depressed and apathic, nihilisticly searching for a way out.
I went through the motions every day. I forced myself out of bed in the morning. Usually i overslept with a few hours but luckily very few people could step into my shoes at work, so it was tolerated. I went to work and collapsed on the bed when i got home. I saw no point in the totality of my neverchanging excistence and i wanted to die. I wanted cancer, i wanted it to end.
And at the strangest times, your wish is often granted.

A day at the doctor reveiled an abnormality in a lymphenode.
I was admitted to the cancer treatment hospital for an operation and released a few days later. 
Nothing to write home about really, but my belief in a pointless existence had been rocked as i started to realize id be dead at the age of 25 if this was a hundred, maybe even 50 years ago. Contemplating these things i started with time to realize id actually miss the small things in life if i died.

I would never have felt the sun on my face again, the wind pulling at my clothes. The snowstorms chilling my bones and stabbing my cheeks.

I would never again have eaten a pancake with shugar.

Never smelt the clean air after a thunderstorm.

Id never again see a lovely girl walking in a bikini at the beach.

Never again hear the birds chitter over the mountain stream quietly dancing through the meadows.

And so, these thoughts started to condense, and i came to the conclusion that the things i would miss were not specific to, say, the pancake. I would miss the very basic action. The seeing, hearing, feeling, tasting and smelling. I would miss my senses.

And thus i knew why i was alive. I knew the essence of my existence.
With this epiphany, a new kind of sense came into being, a combination of them all. It can be described as nothing else than, The experience. 
I could suddenly stop when it came over me and just be. Just feel the experience of receiving input through the senses. It was exhilarating.
Sitting on a bench in a town square. Riding a roller coaster, walking in the woods. All the things that would challenge my senses and push them further than before.
And my wish for death slowly started to melt away.

But wishes granted are often granted with a two barreled shotgun, to use a different cliche than the double edged sword one.

The cancer of course was back and got a real grip this time. I was granted my wish and i could never take it back.

I was admitted again the same day it was discovered and scheduled for a 4 hour open surgery the next day. 
After not eating for a day and drinking lots of foul tasting, bowel emptying juices the surgeon came to see me to explain what he was going to do.
They were going to go inn through my stomach muscles up under the rib cage and remove 13 of the worst affected lymphnodes in my thorax.

I was given a pill to daze me for insertion of some kind of coma inducing dripper into my spine. I believe coma is preferred during these operations over drugs that shut down your nerves. I dont even remember counting backwards before the void claimed me for the first time.

And then my world exploded. 
I was wide open from my pelvis to my ribcage. I was mangled, and the pain was like a perfect storm. The one that lifts you off your feet and slams you into the wall. The one that rips trees from the ground and grinds your very soul to cinders. I was dying and it couldnt come fast enough.

Two hands appeared at my side. They were female and very pretty. The nails were cut short and had no nailpolish. They were covered in a brownish residue. The skin was smooth but the folds around the joints were prominient. It was the hands of a 40 year old woman. It never occurred to me to look up. All that existed through the storm where those hands and the needle they were injecting into a plastic tube hanging next to my head.
And so i vanished into the darkness, and hoped i would not remember this where i was going next.

I was floating in nothing, and there was something familiar with the interruptions in my existence. Sounds it had been called. Voices dawned on me and i knew that was it. Far away voices were talking. A male and a female. It was crude and gutteral. Ugly cracks in silence. 
I shut them out and the void reclaimed me to take me to my next existence.

There is something strangling me I realized waking up. I wanted to tell the voices, but i couldnt speak. I wanted to wave to get their attention, but i couldnt move.
I had no influence on this world. I was a rock drowning in a river. I was alone.
A constant high pitched tone started up in the distance. The current swept me away and the void reclaimed me to take me to my next existence.

This one will be better i thought, and decided try life again. 
Are you ok? Someone asked me. I was in the recovery ward and the storm had abated
I still couldnt move, but i was able to open my eyes.
This is progress, i remember thinking. I am luckier than the last time i lived...

After recovering from the operation i was placed on a chemo therapy that lasted for 3 months. At the start i thought nothing much of it, but i soon deteriorated into a quivering shadow of what i once was. I was hooked up to the rat poison every weekday, but the Thursdays were the worst. Two nurses and a doctor usually came visiting with a bag wrapped in aluminium foil carried on a tray. They were all wearing gloves and masks. 
Thursdays i wanted to live more than any other day of the week.

I used to love the nights back then. I do to this day actually. They were free of the poison and it was bliss. 
All the tubes and wires were disconnected and i felt like pinochio turning into a real boy. If i was drugged enough i could almost remember being alive. I could almost remember that i once could walk for a mile. That i could laugh and run, jump and climb a tree. Almost alive...somewhere

There was a room on the ninth floor with some couches, chairs and a tv where four patients used to sit and not talk. The tv was never on.
They would stare at me and nod when i entered, but never say anything. I dont think they even knew each others names. But they seemed as close as any friends could ever get. I enjoyed their company even though they were 40 years older than me. Age didnt seem to matter, we were all here and there was nothing to say.
I started to frequent this room more and more as time passed. Everywhere else there were people wanting to talk or look, encourage or pity. 
It was disgusting and I hated them all.

About 6 weeks had passed and a blessed night came again. I quietly walked through the corridors until a man came up to me. It was the first male nurse i had seen since i was admitted. I hadnt thought of it before, but this work place was really dominated by women. He had made me cereal with milk; one of the few things i could swallow without puking back up.
There is plenty of shugar he said, smiling as he handed me the bowl. Not waiting for a thank you, he turned and left. He'd seen the night walkers before and knew what was coming.

The bowl was heavy and i knew i couldnt carry it far so i headed for the stairs leading up to the 9th floor. At the first step i knew i wouldnt be able to climb them this night. 
I had always liked sitting in stairs for some reason and found a sort of poetic beauty in having this meal here. The stone was cold and i sat down with the bowl in my lap. I had to spent a few moments getting my breath back.
Being able to bend down to sit is something you might not cherish. But once you loose it, you realize its immense value.

Dark empty halls seemed to stretch for an eternity. Nothing outside mattered or was even real anymore. These halls were the world i knew now, the foundation of my existence. 
I started eating my cereals, letting go of one piece of my past for each bite. Grinding the memories as i chewed.

Chomp, i was climbing in a tree. I could see to the end of the world, i could climb into the sky. 

Chomp, i was on a swing with Eve. We were weightless, we were flying. She was laughing and i shared in her laughter.

Chomp, i was riding a bike. I was going faster than i had ever thought possible. No runner could ever catch up with me.

Chomp, I was walking to school. I was curious of what would come. Excited of what we would learn.

Chomp, I was landing my first heelflip on a skateboard. I was proud, i was admired by others. i was accepted.

Chomp, I was riding a moped. I could go wherever i wanted, i was free.

Chomp, I was running through the woods with an ag3 automatic rifle. I was in a brotherhood. I was defending a nation.

Chomp, I was at a party, talking to... Kristin... I was in love. 

Tears started streaming down my face as she vanished, but there was no going back and i continued eating.

Chomp, I was on extacy at a rave. The beats vibrated through the air that surrounded me. I was a spiral galaxy, i was dancing flame. 

Chomp, I was being told i had cancer. I was speechless.

Chomp, i was walking into a small room of people with strange eyes on the ninth floor. I was missing something important.

Chomp, I was handed a bowl of cereals from a smiling man. I was grateful. 

Chomp, i was siting down on stone steps. I was sitting.

Chomp, i was eating cereal, I was eating.

Chomp, i am chewing. I am the sum of my experiences and memories. I am old.

My whole life had vanished as i finished my last meal. A calm feeling of being whole came over me and i was ready.
I sat the bowl down, closed my eyes and then i died.


""You cant sleep here"" the male nurse told me. ""Your immune system is nonexistent and these steps are cold. Lets get you back to bed."" 
And that is how my next existence started.

I was hollow for a long time after that. It was like sensing through a veil. Like listening to voices from under water. Everything was far away and i was looking at reality from outside.

Time passed and i went again to the room on the ninth floor. There were three now.
They nodded as i entered but seemed to look at me differently, recognizing something.
And suddenly i saw what they had always said as it echoed in my mind; ""We, who are about to die, salute you."" 
And they were right; We were gladiators, we were fighters and we had all been sentenced to die. 
But each moment we had was a treasure more precious than any earthly riches. We had nothing we could loose, nothing we could want, nothing that could ever be taken away from us. Our life, our thoughts, our actions and opinions were no ones but our own. By letting go of everything, we had gained something new. 
A new beginning, where each experience is a separate existence. 
Like an eternal supply of white paper and colored pencils.

We had gained life.

And so i write this post, not only to free myself from previous battles and to wake again to a new existence. But to tell you that in your next existence, you will one day wake up and realize it is all better, that today is a good day.

I promise.

"I feel stuckMy girlfriend died by suicide 9 weeks ago.  I struggle every day, attempting to make sense of it all, including why I'm sticking around.  I feel horrible for saying it, but I'm really frustrated because I'm only staying alive because I have children and I don't want to be anymore.  Don't get me wrong, I love my kids unconditionally, but I don't love life anymore.  Everything is a labor, I just feel exhusted by the idea of living...and yet, I'm guilted into suffering thru for them.  While I accept that's my responsibility, my mind continues pull at me to just end it.  Why do other people get to be douche bags and kill themselves, leaving behind children, yet I'm not allowed to.  I'm perpetually told, ""you just have to be strong.""  Which I hate hearing...and I ruminate on the idea that this life doesn't matter, so even if I did, it really wouldn't matter.  I mean, what does it matter some guy 300 years ago killed himself?  I understand others would feel the pain I do now and I don't want that, but what I do want is my girlfriend back at best (which isnt going to happen) or my pain to end (immediately).  How much pain is enough to justify it?  Part of me says, ""No amount, it's not an opition because of my children,"" but part of me says, ""It's my life and my choice!""  However, when i think about my girlfriend, while that's true, it still hurts and I still have trouble not internalizing that rejection.  I know I'm rambling, but I got tired of doing it all alone in my head tonight...so please offer some advice or prospective and help me find a way out of this trap.  I know there is no way I can continue to endure this struggle.  I need some sort of resolution...and therapy, groups, friends, work, personal interests, and anything in-between, I'm already actively doing, yet it's all a labor.  Nothing provides releif.  ",1

"Point of life when nothing you want can be accomplishedWhat’s the point of life, when you are ugly? When you are not smart? When you are not social but you would love to be. When you can not even tally anyone. Honestly corona makes everything worse, because before this I was forced to talk to people, now I am not. Furthermore I always tried to support other people and make their life better, I always thought if I can’t be happy, my point in life could be to make others happy, to help them. But maybe I am just a net negative for this world. 
Yesterday I found out, that people exist which do not have emphaty (psychopaths), I was horrified by the thought, that actually 4% of people seem to be like this. What if everyone is like this? What if nothing you thought is true is true? If everyone is like this, than everyone always used me. I want to die so much alll day I am thinking about death. I would love to be stronger more confident and less thoughtful of others I would have done this.
The only reason why I can do it, is because I really love my family and I do not want to hurt them. I am a bit scared of the pain aswell to be honest. What should I do now, after I realized all this? Hopefully soon the pain is enough to not give a fuck anymore, I am too exhausted just want to sleep....",1

And they start making me feel guilty that i am not religious. And i do feel guilty and it makes me want to not live even more. Its not me wanting to kill myself. I just dont want to live. Cause i hate myself and my life.",1
"Oh where to begin...I've been plagued by mental health issues pretty much since birth  

This caused an enormous amount of strain on me and my family, and made me an outcast from early childhood and gained a reputation of weird, out there, bad, ect from people who knew absolutely nothing about me. But I just shrugged it off and kept on going.  

Then in middle school I started getting bullied, couldn't walk down the hallway without getting called a faggot and it being middle school the rumors about me just flew like crazy. Then I was homeschooled in 7th grade because of the bullying and the rumors took on a whole new level of crazy and just flat out bullshit. But I just kept going.

And then in 8th grade I went back to school, and finally made friends. People still had all kinds of bullshit ideas about me without ever even having a conversation about me. But I actually made friends.

Then in high school everything got better at first, I had tons of friends who I considered family. I wasn't being bullied (to my face). And I was actually happy.

Then my second year of high school started and BOOM insomnia. I became extremely irritable, I was sleeping in class, wasn't shaving, dressing like shit and so on. Well I didn't know this at the time but my cyclothymia (""lesser"" version of bipolar disorder) had kicked into 12th gear. What makes matters worse is I was already seeing a shrink and psychiatrist. So I was getting medication. But can you guess what meds I was getting? Just anti-depressants. And for those who don't know, ADs + cyclothymia or bipolar disorder = (in my case) hypomania. What fun. Basically for 3 years I was mostly hypomanic. I'm sure you can all guess what this was like.  

Well since one of the symptoms of hypomania is arrogance, this got mistook for narcissism. And a certain (true narcissist) didn't like this. So he went around to all my friends (who I considered family) and told them I was this horrible person who thought all of them were less than me. Which of course I didn't, I saw almost all of them as my equal.  

And then it gets better, he decided to assume that I was also a liar because I mentioned that I fell into a firepit when I was a kid and melted my hand together. But there's no scar. So I must be lying. Even tho it did really happen. I'll find a way to prove it to you if you don't believe me. . He told everyone this. So practically overnight my family was gone.  

My insomnia had gotten to the point where I was staying awake from 81 straight hours and to cope, I turned to xanax and benadryl to sleep. The fallout is obvious.  

So I'm left alone, addicted to xanax, going fucking mad from sleep deprivation, and I dropped out of high school.  

9 months later I had a nervous breakdown, cyclothymia progressed to full blown bipolar disorder. I start flying off the handle and punching holes in walls. Smoking tons of weed to cope. Struggling with xanax and ativan. And I have no one. Not a single person.

What's the point. None of you will read this far down my rambling to read this. I ruined everything. But no. I'm apparently not allowed to be happy or have friends. I just ruin everything.",1

I didn’t have friends until i met her. I didn’t understand people the way i could have. And because of this i ruined everything. I felt the need to always be there if the group was hanging out. I felt the need to always be in the party on PlayStation if she was on. These feelings were completely unjustified, and fueled by my anxiety and insecurity. I couldn’t help it. 

She was the only person who showed me genuine kindness. She genuinely cared for me. She was the first person I’ve ever hungout with. We hungout all the time too, playing games together, going out to eat. Just enjoying eachothers company. 

We actually met at work. Its where i opened up to her and we became really good friends. And because of this I’m afraid to go to work anymore. 


I can’t process any of this. The first thing my mind jumped to was killing myself. I feel like my social and work life is over. I can’t stop thinking about taking my life. I have no one else in my life. Im back to where i was before i had her in my life. Being alone.",1

"Without music, I have no desire to live...I used to be a professional musician. I ruined it by trying to kill myself. Whatever. I kinda blocked out a lot of these memories but over the last 2 years it's come back. And now I just can't listen to music without breaking down crying. I just want to die. And without music, I'm nothing. It's the only reason I had left to stay alive. I hate my life. I just hate it. I hate it so much. I can barely play either without just wanting to die.

My money problems don't matter. Me being 7-17 days away from being homeless don't matter.

The only thing that matters is that I can't listen to music and I can barely play. That and I miss my daughter so fucking much. But that's my fault (and no, my ex didn't steal her away from me.

"I want to cry, god fucking damnit I want to cry. Growing up being ridiculed for crying, being bullied for it, I've stopped. I don't know exactly when it stopped, but I just didn't cry anymore.

Maybe it's because I don't have an outlet to confide in. Maybe I just need someone to talk to. But guess what? I can't. I can't talk about my problems to someone I know. What if they think I'm pathetic? What if they think I'm weird? What if they think I'm weak? I don't want to be seen as such, so I've refrained. But it's been so fucking long since I've cried my heart out. My heart has cracked, but nothing is escaping. I constantly feel sad, on the verge of a breakdown. But just when I think it's finally going to happen, I'm finally going to release my pent up stress and feelings, I stop myself. 

I haven't been able to go on and cry, get emotional, get real. I'm so fucking done with this. I don't trust anyone enough to talk to them. I have people I know I can trust, but for some reason I don't trust them. Maybe it's because I know that at any moment they can betray me. Reveal all of my problems to someone I don't even know.

Point is, crying is important. If you ever start crying, cry your fucking heart out. Trust me, you'll need it.",0

I Cant Handle This AnymoreI am a 15 year old girl and I just feel like I can't do it anymore. I've been fighting depression for two years and have lost almost all of my friends.

It hurts so much I can't see a way out anymore. I don't want to die I just don't see another option.,1

"I never really felt this until I developed an anxiety disorder.I don't know anyone who is as much of a loser at this age.

There are so many things I *have* to do in order to survive and I'm so terrified I end up doing nothing. The furthest I've gotten is making a call, my legs were shaking and I couldn't talk and ended up hanging up.

I was in an abusive relationship and my ex left me in debt that isn't my fault, but instead of getting legal help I just don't check my email.

I was just a depressed, alienated person for a while until I met her. She was a bipolar sociopath. Even within a year I had already changed into a different person, scared, more easily agitated, more co-dependent. After seven years... I startle over mild noises and think about dying.

I tried to hang myself while living overseas. There was no escape. I was dependent on her entirely and she was telling me she was going to leave me there, illegally (violating our EU residency), with nothing. When she really came into her power, she would rip blankets and clothes off me and scratch and pinch me into letting her take my clothes off and doing whatever she wanted.

Maybe people like me don't deserve to live. I've given all I ever want to give, I'm used up. I just want to hide forever. If it weren't for my kitties I would've vanished by now.

"Despite what we will tell you Californians do have an accent Mine is basically standard American, but thatâ€™s cuz I was basically forced into a standard American accent cuz my family would correct me if I spoke in anything but that, so my accent is distinct from most people around me, although thatâ€™s relatively common, but most peoples accent where I live sounds like if a NorCal accent had a slight southern drawl and had the speed and stressing of a valley gurl accent, itâ€™s bazaar and so easy to understand, although the people that stray more towards the valley gurl side are a bit harder to understand

"I (15M) was FORCED by my ONLINE SCHOOL to CUT my HAIR because it was considered FEMININE and UNHYGIENIC. A month ago I was forced by my school to cut my hair because it looks feminine and unhygienic because it had a medium hair length (my family also supports this).

I loved and cared my hair for half a year then get it stripped away from me unwillingly. 

This somewhat traumatised me but I had to keep a happy face although I know Iâ€™m being constantly shamed by the system if I make a sad face because again it was considered too feminine.

I had lost weight even though I was already underweight and havenâ€™t slept a lot ever since, I also considered jumping off my balcony multiple times but somehow Iâ€™m still living.

"Is it time?Been reading some posts on a variety of suicide instances and never thought I would be at crossroads again. 

Did attempt suicide with pills when I was in my late teens struggling with the pressures of college and not doing well.

Been to see a clinical psychologist a few years back and that helped, only reason I did was because I started to get dark thoughts and stopped short of going to 'search' for ways to end it. The coping tools helped at the time though as It does from time to time the urge or thought always is in the back of my mind and in the last few months has been increasing.

I have a really good friend who knows about most of this except for the most recent thoughts,  and I know I'm not a burden but I keep feeling like I am even though my friend who is really patient and kind tells me I'm not. 

At work I am lucky to have good managers and colleagues who if I ever needed any help would not hesitate to help, though with the first bunch of lockdowns and having already taken time off to deal with this just doesn't sit right having to take time off when numerous deadlines are approaching. 

Perhaps on one level I just needed to say this without people knowing me or judging me, though easier said than done.

I guess I've just been tired for a long time and it's sad that I feel suicide is the only way out. 

I don't deny people who love me will be sad and devastated however I can't help how I feel.

Hoping just by typing this out it will help just to say all that and figure out the next steps.....",1

"Just wanna let you know that if you push through it and actively improve you can acheive wonders.Hi reddit. This is a new account I've made and with it I actually wan't to start posting more often, since I've been a creeper most of my time on here. I've been on this platform for a little less than a year and it really helps me get through my own depression, thanks for that. This is my first post ever on reddit of all time. I'm on mobile so sorry if the formatting is bad, and also this is also a very long rant for those who wish to read. 

I'm a 15 and about to be 16 year old male who has/is still going through a rough patch in his life. I have made huge progress within the last couple of months both mentally and physically. 

I was put in quite a rough spot since I was a kid and have been both depressed and lonely most of my life aside from my very first years when I didn't care. My whole life I have been really ununsuccessful socially and never found talent in anything at all. When I say that I have never had any friends besides family I mean it 100%. I've also been fat most of my life. I was never  morbidly obese or anything but just chubby and never fit. This of course made me even more depressed. 

The past couple of weeks have been the most significant part of my life to date. What set it off was a bad day. I came home after a really bad day and my mother said some hurtful things and this combined with the bad day caused me to explode internally. Due to my upbringing I've always kept things inside and I always try to not display emotions even when I'm alone. On this day I hadn't cried in like 4 years and I walked into my room buried my face in my bed and cried for what felt like an hour. While I was crying I thought of all the shit that had happened to me during my life. I thought a lot of my grandpa which was my only father who died about a year ago. My grandma who died about a month ago. Although I wasn't as close to her I loved her so much. Thought of how cheated I felt and how lonely I was. I would shift from sadness to absolute hate. While I calmed down I told myself that I would change completly from the the day forward. I also told myself that I would be happy no matter how hard it got.

Now lets go to the present day and I am proud to say that I have lost over 10 pounds and counting. Making a lot of progress on work that I have to catch up for school. I decided to get more social and because of that effort I was so scared to put in, I made 1 friend irl a couple days ago. We have many shared interests and he said that he would introduce me to his friends. We shared numbers and are keeping in touch.

Don't give up and give it a try.

"I'm already a failure and I want to dieLet me precede this by saying I am not going to kill myself, I just want to be dead very badly, or better yet, to not have existed at all in the first place. Like if a jet engine crashed through my ceiling and crushed me a la Donnie Darko, I'd be chill with that. I don't want to kill myself, but I feel that it is my destiny to die young, and my moral duty to take away the strain of birthing such a fuck up from my family.

Again, I pose no immediate danger to myself or others, but I am plagued with the constant feeling of being unworthy and undeserving of the life in my veins.

I'm a 19 year old female, and I completely hate myself. I have been suicidal and depressed for most of my life. I remember being as young as 7 years old (really young, I know) and wrapping sheets tighter and tighter around my neck because I wanted to stop breathing, and praying to God to take me to heaven.

By all accounts, my life on paper isn't bad. My family is middle class, I never wanted for food or shelter, I went to a public high school and almost graduated in the 10% of my class. I participated in track and cross country, I took upper level and advanced placement classes, did very well in them, and was an artist. I consider myself somewhat good looking. I had a few boyfriends.

But the whole time, I fucking hated myself. The reason I worked so hard was because I would feel so *guilty* whenever I'd let someone, especially my family, down. No matter how hard I worked for approval and recognition, there was always someone better than me.

I graduated from high school and got a substantial scholarship to one of the most prestigious universities in my state a few hours away. I failed 3 out of my 4 classes, didn't talk to anyone, started self harming again, cried in bed all day, gained weight despite barely eating, and my anxiety and depression were at an all time high. I called my mom crying and told her I wanted to go home, I hated it. She was somewhat sympathetic, but my dad would rant and rave at me over the phone for over an hour about what a mistake I was making.

I left, came home, applied at a community college for the next semester and got a job.

I thought I would get better but I just keep getting worse. It's been a little over a year since I graduated from high school, and I hated high school so much that I thought I'd get at least a little better after.

But I just keep getting worse. I go deeper and deeper into my depression. I don't care what I eat or how I look, everything is a mess, I stopped going to my summer class because I didn't care but I still leave 2 mornings out of the week with my backpack so my parents think I am going. 

I just want someone to be proud of me so badly, but my family thinks I'm a fuckup. They wanted me to be better than they were at my age, and I can't be. They had such high expectations for me, and I ruined them.

My one long term goal that I have had for the majority of my life is to join the military. I put off getting help with my mental health my whole life because I knew I would be medically disqualified from enlisting with a history of mental illness. 

Recently, I discovered that I would already be disqualified because of my documented medical history of chronic migraines, and the medication I was prescribed for it.

When I read that, I have never been so completely heartbroken in my life. I have never hated myself so badly, not even when a trusted coach in high school told me I should consider losing weight to reduce the size of my breasts so that my body would be more suitable for running.

My one goal that I ever fucking had, the one thing I looked forward to achieving, was just stripped from me.

And yes, under certain conditions, a waiver could be granted, but the circumstances of people looking to enlist being granted migraine waivers are very rare.

I hate myself because I was born into this body. I always felt like I was supposed to have been born male, and experienced gender dysphoria, but I knew I could never pass as a man, and transitioning would only make things harder for me. I always hated wearing glasses. I always hated being short and more on the curvy side because it reminded me that I was female, and that I did not have the long, lean athletic body type I always dreamed of. I hate that my brain is fucked up, that I cannot solve my mental illness ad it is most likely the result of biochemical imbalances. I hate that I get migraines. I hate that I was born into this weak, broken body that I never asked for.

I hate that my only goal was taken from me because of something I did not choose to have.

I have no goals and no motivation, and I think that I should die so that I can stop being a disappointment, and so that I can finally have release from this body and stop suffering. I am trapped, I am so trapped.

It is not fair that there are people who want to live, who have purposes and dreams, who are killed by illnesses and accidents. I wish I could absorb someone's terminal disease and die for them.

It is not fair that I want to die and am relatively healthy. I wish I could die in a car accident or from a sudden deadly disease so no one would feel guilty about me killing myself.

All I've ever wanted to do was help people and protect people, and I feel that the best way for me to help people and protect people is to remove myself from the equation so I am no longer a burden. I just want to go to sleep and never wake up.",1
"How do I atone for harassmentIn short me and my ex fought on her social media months ago. I've since left her alone, however the posts are still up there and theyve exposed my full name.

Even though it isnt me. It can get me in serious trouble for something I no longer do. I keep thinking about it and it's driving me crazy and to depression.",1

"It's on nights like tonight, when the snow really comes down, when I think about how easy it would be to die in a car ""accident""I just wanna die. That's it, I'm over it. Don't give me the platitudes, and yes that includes you and whatever saying you were about to type. My life won't get better, and people don't get it. I'm only living for other peoples' convenience. I bear the pain so they don't have to.



Everyone says ""if you're still here that must be something still worthwhile!""


No there isn't. Nothing at all, nobody and nothing is worthwhile. Do you want to know the reason I'm still alive? The one and only sole reason? I repeat, the *only* reason I'm still alive: fear of a failed attempt. When I do it I'm gonna do it right and it's way harder than most people think. I'm not here because anyone would miss me, or there are things left I wanna do, or because I have any hope. Just can't afford to attempt suicide and not actually die. Lethality of my method is key and failure isn't an option. That takes a LOT to plan. I've never planned something so meticulously as my own suicide. I've done all the research and the math, working on getting the things I need and then that'll be it.



But then I also think of nights like tonight when there's a huge snowstorm, accidental deaths and car crashes everywhere, that that could be me. I could have an ""accident"" out of nowhere and nobody would even need to know I ever killed myself. They really wouldn't think I did. Nobody in my life has any reason to suspect that I'd kill myself. They think I'm fine, just another worker drone thankful for the gift of life.



I'm smart enough to know that I can't do it that way. There's too high a chance of survival and then I'd just be fucked up and probably with no car, therefore no job, probably end up homeless, etc. No bueno. Some EMTs would brave the cold and be the heros, forcing someone to stay alive when literally all they want is death. Save somebody else! Don't waste your time.



But no. That's why my plan involves a cover story (I camp a lot, me disappearing for even like a week+ is normal) so I take vacation time from work, tell everyone I'm away on a camping trip, and just quietly go end the pain. Nobody would think anything of it for a few days and by then I'd be long gone. The lethality of my method combined with nobody thinking they needed to send help means no hero would be able to revive me and force me back to misery.



Hopefully I only have to make it until the spring, and I KNOW I have to wait for the best chance of success. But it's so tempting to just rush and do it now. It's like that experiment where they leave kids in a room with a piece of candy and say they'll get 2 pieces if they wait to eat it, but they never do. I'm trying to wait for my 2 pieces. And no that doesn't mean I'm holding on because I wanna live longer, I'm waiting because I *don't* want to live longer. I can't have a failed attempt, it's gonna be one and done. I don't want to make a suicidal gesture or a cry for help, I want to *die.* That's it. That's why no matter how tempting it might be to kill myself early, I'd probably fail. I have to be patient.",1
"I should have killed myself already but I just can't give a shit about anything anymoreMy life has been going down the shitter, been arrested, about to be banned from driving, family hate me for being an all round loser, literally no friends, for the entire last month all I have done is play he same fucking games on my PC and smoke weed and even the weed dealer is forgetting about me even though I give him fucking money, showing up 40 minutes late etc.

Yet I just dont care about anything. A few months ago I had the urge to die and was sitting outside train stations watching the trains pass thinking how I would jump the fence and run in front of it before the driver could brake. But now i am just mentally exhausted. I dont care if they throw me in prison and I dont care if I stay a broke loner bastard my whole life. What difference does it make, I will still go to sleep and wake up and the lottery of which problem will be on my mind today will reset. 

I guess I should leave this sub because I know I am too cowardly to kill myself. I just really wish I would just die randomly though. Why do good people have to die in car accidents and whatnot when it could easily be me and all the shitness of my life would be over in a respectable way. People might actually talk positively about me once i'm gone, if I go soon. But if i draw this misery out too long, then I will die a villain no matter how I go.",1

"Suicidal 30 FHad suicidal moments since being in Abdu I’ve relationship. Been really happy - out of anxiety and depression into a good healthy time for a few weeks while my bf has been away helping family in a hard time but kind to me as well. He asked me to visit and just before revealed being in touch with another woman behind my back. Crushed but wanting to be supportive we worked it out and he cut off communication with her - then I visited Sunday. He was really abusive, it shocked me and I had my first true anxiety attack which brought back feelings of suicide but HARD intensely, then he apologized and I left more or less with him saying he was sorry and would go to therapy after his family emergency resolves and he is back. I was scared but grounded myself. That was this weekend, I’m back and now he is calling back being scary and I’m back to feeling suicidal. My therapist is MIA and my boyfriend is relentless. I worked hard to feel strong and on Sunday when I was panicking I told him I felt suicidal in that moment. Afterwards he said I was “threatening suicide” and so he was considering breaking up with me, this after I just moved for him and have been doing so much for him while he’s been away. I didn’t threaten it, I was reaching out so I wouldn’t do it. Now I feel I’m having the very serious bad planning level thoughts and don’t feel safe telling him. So I’m writing here. I’m scared. I’m thinking about hanging myself in the new kitchen with some stuff I have here. I don’t think it would work I’d probably fall. Considering lighting my car on fire while inside it lately, I really just want to go to bed, and know I’m able to be ok but he keeps hurting me and it’s making feeling calm or sleeping very hard. It’s heartbreaking and makes me want to hurt myself. I’m sorry this is depressing but I don’t feel safe telling anyone in my life, they’re all already stressed and I don’t want to be a burden to them. I can’t tell him or he will threaten me, I think I’m really so alone here and I know this is sad af but this is my hope. ",1

Idk if i should even explain my reasons for it, but ive had suicidal thoughts since i was a kid, maybe just bored with life and always feeling so hollow, even when shit goes south i cant cry even when i want to. Every day is painful to breathe, and to be honest i dont want to get better. I already hated the fact that of all people to survive a bout with cancer, it had to be a suicidal fuck up like me.

"Honest postOkay let me give you some of my background before we get into the politics of it. 
I’ve had a long history of mental health problems since early teenage hood AT LEAST and over the last 2/3 years I’ve been actively suicidal, I’ve been assessed under the mental health act MANY times, I’ve been admitted o hospital for overdoses and self harm many times. Over just the last week I don’t think I’ve gone a day without police or medical staff with me because I tried slitting my throat and wrists and took and overdose and tried jumping off a bridge.
So here’s my question. I’ve been under so many different mental health teams that have discharged me because they can’t do anything or a lot of the ones where I live don’t want to do anything. 
So why won’t they just let me die?
If they can’t do anything, I sure for hell cant do this on my own, so just let me die. Stop saving me. I don’t want to be saved. 

I’ve tried doing everything. The mindfulness. The exercise. The eating well. The making friends. Contacting them when things are getting bad. Taking the medication. Talking to the people I should be about this. And none of it helps me. 

I just can’t do it any longer, it seems like I’m just broke and I just don’t belong. 
Hopefully I’ll manage to die one day and stop this horrible feeling because I can’t manage it and I don’t think it’ll ever go away. 

Sorry
And good luck to the rest of you. X",1

Extremely depressed. Lost my job in a layoff. Though there are no financial issues, I just hate sitting at home and this is not for the past few months. My career has been in doldrums since I got married. Tried my hand at a business, didnt work. Started a couple of well paying jobs, had to leave them. Wanted to start something after the layoff, plans are shelved becasue of COVID19. 
Im extremely ambitious. On the other hand, my husband is so laid back, lacks ambition. On top of it he is so cold and indifferent to me. He abuses me. I hate being mediocre. And therefore I started hating him. Unable to get pregnant even after multiple IVFs, and IUIs. 
My life just seems so purposeless now with failures on both professional and personal fronts and sitting at home idly is just driving me to take the extreme step. Shortly into the marriage, I realised he is not for me and have been depressed ever since, especially with the way he treats me, how lazy he is, how he lacks ambition. I am not oblivious to the attention I get from men, I never cheated on him though. Got N back in 2018, will that be useful now?

"A big majority of the reasons I'm suicidal are related to money and it's the kind of money people my same age who had a better dice roll at birth blow in a few weeks. The world is horrible and cruel and I want outI failed/dropped out of college becaus I'd depression and now I'm supposed to pay my loans back already and my whole family is in crisis and fighting about it, blaming me for all of it. I can't go back to school anywhere else, and I can't pay for rent, my credit card bills, gas, or groceries. My credit score is 460. (*460*) My girlfriend has yelled at me almost every day for not being able to pay my share of rent on time and hit me for it a couple weeks ago.


I'm on 3 medicines and I ran out of one already and am taking half my dose on another because I can't afford the copays to get them refilled. Soon I'll run out of all of them and be fucked. I tried applying for free state insurance but screwed up the paperwork somehow and now it's too late to try again until the end of the year. I don't have a therapist, can't afford one and there are no free ones in my area (I've looked really hard).


I don't have friends to talk to about it and I can't talk to my girlfriend or family about it either. The closest thing I have to therapy is texting a crisis line, but that barely helps.


It's all about money. If I had been born rich I literally would be fine right now. I could be back in school, have my debts paid off or not have them in the first place, have the therapy and medication I need, and I would be completely fine.

"I don't know what happenedI don't know what to say right now. My life just changed completely and I can't handle it. I've been receiving treatment for depression since I was a teenager. Now I'm 31 and I've accomplished nothing. I started working when I was 14. Had to quit when I was 19 for my mental health. Started college but quit halfway through my degree. I was approved for social security disability shortly after that. I don't leave my house unless it's to see my doctor. I don't have any friends or acquaintances. None. Three years ago I realized how much my loneliness was affecting my life. I posted on Reddit and ended up meeting a guy. My life changed after meeting him. We wanted the same things. The same future. We got along really well. Ended up meeting in person a few months after talking. Fell in love. He broke up with me a week ago. We're still in contact daily. We still love each other. He still wants me to work on improving my life and to see me doing well. But he said he needs time to do some important things, he needs to buy a car, he wants to look into buying a home because he recently had a nightmare of a situation with his landlord. He really is doing those things, but I doubt that's the real reason for why this is ending. I dated when I was a teenager and in my early 20's. He was different from anyone I've been with before. He made me feel so loved. I was improving my life without even realizing it because he made me feel so great. Before I met him I was showering once a month. I wasn't in a good place. The light that he brought into my life was just... indescribable. I was taking care of myself, showering daily, doing chores around both of our places, going shopping, going out to eat, running errands, everything that normal people do. He made me want to be a better person. My life was improving so much. My doctor noticed, my mom noticed. He knew all about my mental health problems and the support he gave me was always perfect. I just can't handle my emotions right now and I'm scared of where my thoughts are heading. I've been miserable for over half of my life. I had three years of pure happiness, and it was suddenly taken away without warning. I had no warning this was coming. He was the only person in my life. My whole support system. It's not that I want to die because he broke up with me. It's so much more than that, so many things I can't put into words. I don't like where I'm heading and I need help because I can feel myself losing my will to live every day. I had everything taken away from me. At least before I met him, I had no idea what real happiness was. I had no idea what I was missing. Now it's gone and I don't have the energy or will to try again. I don't feel like I'm capable of handling this. I feel stupid for having these thoughts, I feel like I should be able to handle a mutual breakup because I'm an adult. But this was so much more than a breakup. He gave me so much strength to fight my depression and work on myself. And now I'm left dealing with both depression and heartbreak and I know it's my own fault for putting so much trust in another person. I need help. I'm so close to giving up",1
"I will never ever get help nor get better. I'm just sick. It's just fate. I have to accept that, and try to keep it at the back of my mind, or else I'll just feel bad all the time with no end to it.Never. The only way I can survive is through trying to run away and ignore my problems. I'll never get help. I am just so full of hatred. Everytime I talk to people, I get mad, and act mean, and push them away. If not I just haven't said much at all. I can't get help. On the internet I'm safe, but real life isn't possible at all. I'd just ruin everything and how people look at me and I'd lose whatever peace I have left. I am just sick. It is fate. I am just messed up, no amount of talking will solve it, I hate talking, I hate 'opening up', I won't take a therapist because they won't help me, I don't trust my family, my friends won't get me, I will always, always be alone until I die. I'll always be mediocre and live sadly. To be completely honest, I just hate living. My interests are just things you can do if you're alive. I like them, but I hate living. I just don't want to do anything else. Don't want to try, don't want to even think about anything. I'll just finish the stuff I want to do, then hopefully I'll get into another crisis and go through with suicide ( perhaps this time I'll man up because I'll have no unfinished business at the time to make me hesitate ) or maybe I'll just disappear instantly without even having to worry about it, and that'll be it. I just absolutely hate living and I'll never ever be happy and no amount of talking will ever get to me nor help me. No matter how many of these stupid posts I make, I'll just never get anywhere. I am doomed.

Typing this makes me feel so bad already, I just want to stop, let this go, and continue on with the stuff I want to do today.",1
having the thoughts againive been doing so well i haven’t hurt myself in months and it’s been even longer since i attempted taking my own life but i just feel so numb right now. i’ve barely eaten anything lately and i have no motivation to keep going anymore. i used to want to keep going for my future patients (i’m premed) and my future kids but lately i feel like it’s not worth it because that’s so far away and there will be other people in the world to take over. i’m currently sitting on the floor in my bathroom right now just staring at my medicine cabinet because i know for a fact i have pills that will end everything and even tho i’m not particularly sad right now i just have no desire to keep existing. i’m pathetic and useless and if i had any hope that i actually have a purpose besides to die young i would be a moron. hoping not to wake up tomorrow because there’s nothing nice to wake up. thanks for reading this x,1

"How could you do this to me?I have been wanting to die every second of every day for the past few years straight.

You were my soul mate, we were meant to be together, and you chose someone else. I can't believe you did this to me. Any time I tell someone about this, which is rarely, they say I'll get over it, find someone else. But no one fills the gap, no one replaces you, no one. Am I seriously living in a fucking time where this is fucking happening?

How are all of my fucking feelings one way? There's no fucking way! When I first met you, I saw the way you looked into my eyes, and I felt the same, and I was dedicated to you.

I did everything for you, you motivated me like never before in my life, and then you turned into a completely different person out of nowhere. And you treated me worse than the most hateful Nazi treated any Jew. You acted like I was the greatest anathema to walk the earth, and you were everything I was looking for, you were the one I was waiting for, the source of my life.

And then you left me in the most brutal way possible, you called me the worst names imaginable, you ran off with someone else. I can't believe you did this to me. I look back upon every memory, and I look around, no one compares to who you were. People tell me I'll find someone else. I won't, I can't. No one fills the gap, and no one ever will. You were everything to me you fucking asshole. How could you do this to me? 

I learned there is no god. I learned everything is just opportunistic, and is nothing more than a predator-prey world, survival of the fittest. I learned the universe cares about nothing. I've been wanting to die ever since I met you, because when I met you those were my best memories, until you stole my soul away, and then I was told you weren't the right person by other people around me, WHEN I THOUGHT YOU WERE! I KNEW YOU WERE! YOU KNOW IT WAS TRUE AND YOU RUINED EVERYTHING!

I don't want anyone else but you! The way you were! Why did you change? I have been in pain for years since you stole my soul, and ever since you were gone I have had no soul ever since then. 

I've been empty, nobody, nothing. You filled me completely, and no one can. I want all of my memories to cease functioning, the only thing I seek is death, and I want to kill myself every day. I can't believe life did this to me, and you ruined my entire future, and the rest of my life.

I can't live another day. No one will replace you, I don't care what people tell me. No one can. God is evil, if he exists, and fuck him. He can't help me, the only way he can is to bring you back to me. I want you to love me, not someone else.

&amp;#x200B;

I want you to love me, not someone else. I wanted to marry you, and you never respected me. Do you have any idea how much I loved you, what I did for you, what I would've done for you as well? You have no idea how much motivation you were. I can't have you, and I have to wake up another fucking day without the hope that you can return into my life while I'm still in my physical prime. But no, only when I have a terminal illness, I've lost all of my health I have earned through all of my sacrifices I have made, will I see you again. Only when I have no attraction, will you come back to mock me to my face. I wanted us to be together in our prime. And it's an impossible dream, and I'm wilted, and dead every day. You were it. And I was just the unlucky son of a bitch you got handed the worst hand imaginable. 

It's been years, and I have met no one who makes me feel the way you made me feel, and I never will. Every woman who comes into my life is counterfeit, and not you. I wish you came back to me tomorrow.

&amp;#x200B;

I am ready to die, but I am forced to live. I can't stand this anymore. I can't stand the pain every fucking day. I can't live like this, all I pray for is God to kill me now, but out of his unmerciful, hateful, deplorable way of dealing with me, he won't let me forget it all. He won't let my memories burn away, instead they remain like a dark crystal inside of my empty vessel without a soul.",1

"risky coping methodsSo, I’m going to be honest. I’ve been suicidal for a very long time and I try to do all I can to avoid doing what seems inevitable. But I just can’t do it anymore. I don’t really care enough or have much strength after going through numerous long-lasting depressions. I’ve pretty much given up on everything and right now I’m just trying to make it longer and make what time I have left worth it. I’m trying to live ad happily as I can, so I have resorted to taking in massive amounts of caffeine and and drug it myself to sleep at night. I know it’s not healthy and to be honest, the caffeine doesn’t even really do much for me, but at least it’s something. God knows father medicine doesn’t help, regardless of what I try.  I’m not even really sure why I’m posting this. I used to think I wanted someone to talk to but I’ve realized through numerous therapy sessions that I don’t really have any way to describe what I’m feeling, nor do I really even know what I would say. I guess this is more of a “venting post” than anything else. Anyway, I’m probably going to inadvertently kill myself with chemicals. But I honestly have no idea how else to cope because I’ve tried almost everything I can think of. If anyone had any suggestions, I’m all ears. But honestly, I doubt that anyone had any ideas that I haven’t tried yet. But either way. At least I can say that I got this off my chest. Not sure if this would be better here or in suicide noteS.

"I'm awaiting the results of a medical examination, and I'm counting on the very worst. I want to be terminal.I just want to get this out somewhere, because typing it into a text file on my computer doesn't give me any release, and I don't want to tell anybody I know about this because I don't know if anybody I know can handle it.

I'm waiting for some medical results to come in, and though I've never admitted it to myself until the last few days, I realize just how much I want it to be a fatal complication. My life has been a pathetic mess for as long as I remember. I don't remember what happiness or contentment feels like. I'm socially anxious, with a handful of weeks worth of dating experience, no sexual experience, and I'm in love with a girl who is in love with an ungrateful idiot. She knows that I love her, but she doesn't hold back in letting me know how much she wants this other guy who doesn't want her in return. I've been trying to find fault in her ever since so I can get over her, but it's been hard.

Nearly every close relationship I've had has resulted in the person leaving me, always after I've let my guard down and expected no harm, and the result is a version of myself that protects himself by always having an anxious outlook on things. I expect the worst. If the worst doesn't happen, I don't relax because the worst will happen as soon as I do (subconsciously, I feel this way, but consciously, I notice how stupid that is. I can't make myself feel differently on this though).

I spend most of my nights alone, writing. I write a lot. It's what I wish I could do but I know it's not a steady foundation for a career. And I don't know what I want to do, making me feel even more worthless.

On the subject of suicide, I don't think I would be able to bring myself to, because I don't have the means and I fear the pain. But I want so desperately for something to take me out so that I don't have to. I want the prognosis of my tests to be terrible. It's one of the only things that actually keeps me from being as depressed as I am, I think. When the tests more than likely come back as healthy, I think it's going to be the hardest on me.

Anyway, thanks for reading all of this. I don't know what I hoped to achieve in this, except some sort of release. Thanks for clicking and reading.",1

"Anyone here often think of the fact that one day you WILL die? Is this normal?Sometimes I think about it but usually when I'm going to bed I think of what it's like dying. It's an overwhelming feeling I get, acknowledging the fact ""someday I **will** die and never exist again."" I will die, I won't see anything else, experience anything else, I won't be able to live here anymore and the world will continue for who knows how long and I'll never live again. I dunno that just pops up out of no where in my mind and I get extremely depressed to the fact I have to fight to surpress my thought from continuing any farther once it starts. It spirals me into this extremely dark depressing place and totally brings my mood down. Anyone have any advice on how to deal with this?",1
@INEFONSECA97 Hello Ines I Want Te,0
"I’m struggling to find an answer, why should I keep living?I’m 23, a college drop out with notions of one day becoming a doctor.
But I can’t afford to study.
Even if I could I don’t know if I could ever get in.

I have nothing.
At best I’ll work for the next 2+ years saving every dime whilst living with my parents.
I’ll be 25/26 when I start, and then it’s 6 years of college and fees.
There are hundred if not thousands of applicants and 3 positions for my situation..

I’m a monumental fuck up, I can’t stick to anything beyond this notion.
I am so deeply unhappy in my life.
I haven’t had sex in over 4 years, I haven’t had a girlfriend in even longer.

I genuinely don’t have an answer to the questions, ‘why not just kill myself?’
I might one day get to study medicine, that’s the only sliver of hope I have.
Even if I did get in, I don’t know if I have it in me to pass.

"I just want outFor context: I’m a 19 yo mtf girl in college(failing but still). My family sucks. My dad told me to my face that he thinks I’m making a huge mistake and that he views me as a complete stranger now, refused to help me with anything and took me out of his will after I came out to him. My grandparents and extended family damned me to hell and did the same. My brother just stopped talking to me and pretends I don’t exist. My mother pretends to care and be supportive but actually takes it personally and constantly tries to convince me it’s a phase so I shouldn’t do anything drastic. Growing up my parents didn’t give a shit about me, my dad was and still is an abusive alcoholic and my mom would always blame me and punish me even when I was fighting back against my step brother “James” (not actual name, 5 years older). James bullied me at home for years then in around 5th grade started sexually harassing me, in 6th he started sexually abusing me (forcing me to suck his dick etc.) and in 9th he started regularly raping me. Again, I was punished if I tried to fight back or say anything. I tried to kill myself too many times to even count but was always being watched and was stopped every time. I have scars everywhere, from cutting or cigarette burns, scrapes and cuts from abuse, all sorts. I lost the will to even try to live “well” I stopped trying in school, stopped fighting back against James, stopped asking for help. Now after going to college I’m failing everything, get treated like trash, misgendered etc. I’m failing all my classes and landed myself in the psych ward bc campus police found me just before I jumped off the 13th floor of my dorm. I got out by lying that I was fine and it was a misunderstanding, which the psychiatrist bought for some reason. I’m so far past “can’t take it anymore” that I don’t even know how to sound like I care, I don’t have the energy to do anything but add more ties to the railroad on my arm, sitting alone, in the corner of a dark room every day.

a fucking abomination of flesh and bones
that was fucking created for NO fucking reason whatsoever
we are really selfish
most of us only care about ourselves

running and running the same fucking cycle with no end
its so repititive 
and fucking boring
and i dont get it
why we strive to live(or the way most people think humans should do,no bitch some of us wants to die)

what the hell are we fighting for?
what greater purpose do we have?
other than eating sleeping fucking around working our asses for a meaningless paper
and the cycle returns again
we only hurt eachother
pain eachother
destroy the nature
hurt the animals
kill and rape eachother
destroy the air with gases from factories
ruin earth
fight over fucking stupid reasons
like religion
and beliefs
we are so fucking delutional for fighting over ""whos right and whos wrong""
who the fuck are you or am i to decide what we do is wrong or right
here in my country they kill gays
trans and people who changed their religion
fucking isis am i right?
i fucking used to believe in god when i was younger
i was fucking naive from the ugly truth of this fucked up rat race
imagine putting up religion just for the sake of controling people
and that there is enternal hell if you didnt follow jesus or any other gods
im not saying that i know whats the truth about us humans and how we were created , im clueless just like you
im still wondering if there is a higher powerful being up in the sky
i seek truth with an opened mind
that is believing in every possible thing imaginable
may there is a higher being
may there is not
and even if there is 
it may be evil
it may be good
and not just some fucking retarted asshole whos claiming his religion and way of living is the only right and everyone is in the fucking wrong

I'm so broken I can't remember what happy is anymoreKind of a rant and a scream for help. Few weeks ago I saw a list of mandated reporter criteria for what is abuse. Well it's been getting to me and I have been having some scary flashbacks to when I was younger about 4 or 5 and my adoptive parents would lock me in my room for a nap. Even if I did take a nap I would wake up needing to go to the bathroom and finding the door still locked would bang and scream to be let out and no one would answer or come up and check on me. Also twice that I can remember I crapped my pants. It has been so thourghly fucking with me that I want these memories to stop by any means and that includes killing myself if that's what it will take then so be it. I am so alone and just feel so abandoned I don't want to be alone anymore. I can't fucking take it anymore. I think this may have been one of the reasons that I drank as much as I did. Even coming up on two years sober is not helping. I don't want to call or text the helplines after the numerous stories I've heard here. I have some severe trust issues. I no longer want to keep going or hang in there if this is going to keep fucking with me,1

"My husband is forcing me to live. I don’t know if I can love him after that.Everything has been a nightmare since graduating college in May 2019. I got fired from the job I got out of college, I’ve been unemployed since August 2019, and I can’t qualify for unemployment or disability for my depression. Although I got married in November, I’m still miserable. I love my husband with all my heart but even that hasn’t been good enough to keep me going. 

I had a breakdown last month about being unemployed and useless. He’s a PhD student with two years left to graduate and he’s a research assistant. His pay is the only thing keeping our heads above water right now. He said that he’ll just DROP OUT and get a job somewhere with his Bachelor’s. However, this is the worst economy we’ve been in since the 2008 recession. I don’t want him to give up his pay that he’s receiving for being in his PhD track in Computer Science. CS is guaranteed 6 figures when you end up working at Google or become a professor. He’d be giving up his goals in life for me and I won’t be able to live with myself. It would make us worse off.  I know that he loves me but I feel that anyone would resent you for that. 

I feel like he (whether intentional or not) gave me an ultimatum. Live on in misery or have him give up his dreams and potentially resent me for it. He’s forcing me to stay alive and be miserable. I don’t know if I can love him after he told me that he might drop out. He has his whole life ahead of him and I’m not sure I can stand another 2 years before he gets a tech job. My depression and social anxiety is the worst it’s ever been, and I just want the pain to stop. I wish I never met him so that I won’t feel guilty about leaving any loved ones behind. All of my other family can die for all I care.",1

"Despite what the media says, depression is not treatable, and asking for help is pointless.I’ve seen over two dozen therapists and been on nearly every psychotropic medication out there. The meds range from useless to making things even worse. 

Similar for therapists. I’ve done CBT, DBT, ACT, psychodynamic, and all of the other acronyms. And it’s all been either a waste of my time, or things actively get worse with therapy. I’ve given therapists feedback that my sessions make me suicidal and I either get “and how does that make you feel?” Or “you’re not working hard enough to make actual progress.” I’m telling the therapists EVERY FUCKING FEELING I’m having, but because I don’t have any particular trauma for them to latch onto, they say I’m holding back and preventing the real work from being done. I’m not a textbook case if someone who needs an epiphany and then the suffering magically goes away. 

But really — I have no actual “reasons” to be depressed. I grew up with a living family. I have a doctorate. I have a unicorn amazing job. But I just get constant waves of very physical feelings of despair and hopelessness. My current therapist just says that I’m not in touch with my feelings, and until I get in touch with them and “really experience and confront the pain,” I’ll never get better. I don’t know what to fucking tell him anymore. 

I’m in my 40s and I’ve had there issues since around 10. I’ve tried to kill mystified twice before  in my teens and failed. I get treatment. I do all the “right things.”  Medication and therapy. But it always comes back. Always. 

Im tired. I am sick of this. The actually fact is: for a giant portion of people with depression, they never get better. Ever. Yet the media and world lie to us with stupid cliches like suicide being a permanent solution to a temporary problem. Or they say depression is treatable (lies. They call it treatment resistant depression for a reason, and I’ve been on all of the treatments for TRD).

But for so many of us, IT IS A PERMANENT PROBLEM THAT REQUIRES A PERMANENT SOLUTION.

People who commit suicide are dead long before taking their own lives. Being isolated and excluded is the worst sentence people can put on you, but it's what most people do to feel better about themselves. I'm fucked up. I'm sorry, and I won't be in your way anymore.

I hate people who claim to have an open mind but have no room accepting that people with different opinions exist.

"I am very close to trying something.I need help. I have been suicidal for many years. Attempted but failed once two years ago. As a child I was abused and neglected by a sorry excuse for a mother and no father figure. I have no family and very few friends, none of which I can talk to about this.

I'm tired of being me. Because of my childhood I've become such a hateful person. I get so angry because of the people around me but I have no way to let it out. All the people I loved I've lied to and hurt. It's because of my own actions that I'm alone. I lost the love of my life because of my own ignorance. 

I have no skills. No talents. I never graduated from high school because my mental state was driven into the dirt and I couldn't get work done. I make a fool of myself everywhere I go. Whenever I look back on the past, be it memories of my childhood or just recalling recent interactions I have the overwhelming desire to pull a knife out of the block and run it through my neck again and again. Constant fantasies of blowing my brain out. Nothing can distract me anymore. It never ends.

I can't afford therapy. I'm nothing but a hateful, ignorant, lying coward. I've found a way to give myself a fairly painless death and I'm very close to acting on that plan. I don't want to have to die, but the mental suffering just doesn't stop.

"I'm in a really weird situation right now, and I need to talk about it.I have three main issues right now. Isolation, family tension, and unemployment/having nowhere to live. Sorry this is such a long fucking essay. Sorry it's a mess. 

First of all, I'm NOT going to kill myself tonight, so if you guys know of a better place to post this, please let me know. I feel so hopeless.

Isolation. I'm socially awkward. The thing is, I know there are a lot of people who will dismiss people who claim to be awkward. I don't know how I can even prove that I'm awkward. I just am. I have no friends, but when I'm with new people I'm so bad at talking that I fucking psyche them out, drive them away immediately. I'm getting angry just typing it because I know people don't usually believe people who say that. I HAVE NO FRIENDS. I'M REALLY REALLY REALLY FUCKING ALONE. 
Anyway. Parents. That feels too personal to get into here, but they're worried about me, and the more worried they get, the harder they make my life for me. They recently took away the laptop they had been lending me, which is making it really difficult to continue my job search. Also I don't have access to the computer games I play, which means no human interaction. ...at all.  None. It gets to the point where I get excited if my mom goes out for an hour because it means I can sneak onto a computer and play a game.

I am an adult!!! I have no idea how to get out of here!!!

The days have blurred together for about a month now. I wake up. Go for a walk in the park. Lie in bed. Stare at the ceiling. Read a book. Die a little. Sleep. Repeat. 

I think the reason I posted here instead of to /r/offmychest or something is that I feel like I already died mentally years ago. I have no idea when I'll decide to die on the outside too. I'm worried I'll snap, man. Just do it. Jump off a bridge tomorrow or run onto a highway next week or drink a carton of bleach next month. Who knows, man. I'm just hopeless. I have no idea how to make it out of this isolation.
The biggest thing that scares me about suicide is the possibility of getting it wrong. Surviving an attempt would be so fucking awful I can't stand to even try

I know I'd actually be happy if I were out of this house and employed and exercising regularly and had my own laptop for games. They're such simple solutions. I WANT those things. I thought they'd be so easy to get. But I'm still here, at home, in so so so so much pain.

Even if you can't help me just someone fucking say something, I want someone to acknowledge my pain, I want someone to notice I exist, I want someone to tell me it's not all my fault, even if it is. Please. Help me.",1

some of you may need to hear this, some of you won't care, some of you will think it's utterly ridiculous. but God loves you, no matter how much you are going through, how much you've done, you're forgiven. Things will be tough sometimes, you gotta remember that if everything was all perfect there wouldn't be a reason for him. ask him what he has planned for you, he may answer, he may not. there is a reason.

God is always close but he is closer than ever right now. with the tragic things happening every month, there's no way it's just a coincidence..it's almost a punishment for the horrible things humanity has gotten into. you may think he isn't a loving God, but if a judge let a criminal off without punishment, would they be a good judge?  this world is falling apart. he is ready, he's coming soon, try to be prepared.",0

"The loneliness is killing me slowlyThrowaway because I don’t want to be exposed to people who know my handle.

For the last 5 years, I’ve worked two jobs with 50+ hours a week. A lot of days were double shifts. I’d start at 3am and get off at 4pm. I only had one day off a week.I didn’t have a lot of time to hangout with friends. My boyfriend (now fiancé) and I barely had time for our relationship. I was exhausted and felt lonely.

I wanted to hangout with friends. I wanted to go on date nights with my boyfriend. I wanted to play my favorite video game all day or get lost in my favorite book. I had dreamed of having enough time to dedicate to following my dream of becoming a photographer. But, my life revolves around work and I literally did not have enough time in the day.

Since COVID hit, a lot of things have changed. I lost my full time job (the money maker) and my hours were reduced at my second job. I have never had this much free time in my 31 years of life. I did get to play my favorite video games all day. I did get to pick up a book and get lost in the story. I even picked up my camera, started a website and began my photography journey - which has been doing well. But, I feel more lonely than I did when I didn’t have enough time in the day. And I don’t know why. 

Maybe it’s the break in my daily routine that’s taking a toll on me. Maybe it’s the fact that even though I have a lot of extra time, there’s nothing to really do social wise since Covid has everything on lockdown. I’m the sort of person that needs consistency in their life and I don’t have it at this point in time.

I thought I would be happy to have free time. But it has made even the simplest of tasks hard to overcome. It’s hard to get out of bed in the morning. My favorite games and reading do not spark joy. It is hard to exist right now. When my fiancé and I go to bed I have never felt more lonely. I feel as if there’s a weight on my shoulders and it’s holding me down every day.

I think the exhaustion over the last 5 years of my life has clouded that feeling of letting go, if that makes sense in any way. My heart hurts a lot these days. There’s a dull ache in my chest every minute of every day. I just want to feel whole again.",1

I feel distant from every aspect of my life and every single person, place, and thing I encounter is just a bundle of frustration and self-hate waiting to be opened.

I don't want to die so much as I don't want to live. The only way I've kept going, as sad as it is to say, is by ignoring my responsibilities, disassociating, and playing way too many video games for my own good.

I just don't want to do anything. I just want to lie down in some tall grass and wait for them to find my body.",1
"Happy birthday to me.So its my birthday today and I can't help but feel so so so isolated. A little backstory: I spent my last year with a lot of friends, and had a close knit group that hung out together a lot. I have always had an anxiety problem that got so much worse with my living situation and this year i moved into another room to deal with it. 

My friends cut me off and I was in limited contact with them. Within a few weeks they had replaced me with someone else and were back to their tight group of 6, posting pictures nearly daily of them hanging out, lunches, dinners, parties, concerts, all of them happy. I got more and more isolated and depressed, and my anxiety got worse. I made a few new friends but I couldn't really be much of a good friend so they were never that close. I had one close friend left that i could talk to and open up to and my boyfriend, who broke up with me a few weeks after i lost all my friends. A week later i was assaulted and i went to my old best friends to try and reach out to someone, and sobbing i tried to talk to her about it and she didn't care enough to look up from her computer and facebook. 

My only close friend left a week and a half ago - a close friend of hers and an acquaintance of mine commit suicide and she needed time off. I have nobody left. 

I tried to get closer to people in the groups i'm in and i've been trying for months, but I asked all of them to celebrate my birthday with me and nothing- nobody wanted to. i reached out to my old friends too and they didn't want to either. 

The worst part is that it feels like everyone has other people, they all look so happy and loved and I just feel so isolated all the time. I've tried really really hard to reach out to people, to make new friends, i've been in therapy and counseling and medication and i'm just tired of all of it. i'm ready to be done. I don't want to hurt anyone but i know now for sure that there isn't anyone who cares, its for the best. To anyone who read this &lt;3 i'm sorry to be a downer on your day and I hope you get all the happiness in the world.   ",1

"I need some advice (Not urgent).This is probably going to be a lengthy post but I feel that I need to remove the burden of this feeling; whatever it is.

I'm here because I can no longer deal with this (it has been almost 4 years - I suppressed it a majority of the time). I just finished high school last year. I've been to numerous psychologists and therapists but have not had any luck with any of them. I think it's because I never felt a connection to them and that they just saw me as a client and not as a person. My parents believe that I'm just being ""stupid"" and I need to deal with my problems head on. It's safe to say that if I could, I would not be here right now.

The feeling is a snowball, it starts off as a small, minuet problem that spirals into a catastrophe, causing me to have an overwhelming sense of despair and loneliness. It's a terrible problem that I know many people have and I really want to get rid of it once and for all.

In terms of suicide, I have had strong thoughts and have planned numerous times, I would do it if I didn't feel that I have another chance to prove myself and another chance to really give life a solid go. The waves of ""depression"" (not diagnosed) are an illusion because they feel more frequent every time yet they're still a constant reminder in the background that I will fail and return to the suffering - and that really gets on my nerves.

I'm on a mild dosage of anti-depressants (no idea if I'm supposed to post the brand or strength) but they feel like they're a piece of cardboard trying to stop a bullet (as in, they're basically useless). Unfortunately I have no current therapist so I can't swap or change anything (my parents are not taken to the idea of me seeing another doctor so close to the start of my University's first semester).

My personal life is decent, no drugs, alcohol, abuse or anything like that - which is probably why I just dealt with it, because I knew I was not badly off. I really want to change, I'm sick of being disgusted in my lack of willpower and hating each and every day.
Surely it's still possible to be able to feel like every day is meaningful and that life is not a wasteland occasionally dotted with trees.

It's hard to convey true feelings when I'm out of the problem itself but when I'm within it I neglect everything. I forget to eat, sleep, do important things. There is a strong level of paranoia that has begun and it's really making it difficult to trust others.

This post is only a snippet of my life, it's really hard to put all of the facts and realisations together in a decent way. But I'm not an English major, so I don't really care.

Any ways to strengthen my defense against this reoccurring horror would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you for reading (I'll move the post if it's in the wrong sub).",1
"I'd like some help, if you have a seclet me just say, I don't consider myself a current high risk of suicide. I just want some advice on things I can't talk to anyone I know about. About a year ago, I was in a really bad place. I don't really want to go into detail, but let's just say I had been rejected by everyone and everything that mattered to me at the time. So I set myself a deadline, that within a month or so, if a number of things didnt all go my way, I would just go and end it. I consider myself a rational person. This wasn't a spur of the moment thing, I had taken months of internal debate to decide on it. I had an extremely detailed plan to avoid failure, the correct type of pills, a place where I wouldnt be found before I was done, so on and so forth. I was, at that point at least, completely ready to die. obviously, as you can see, things turned around. They're miles better. But I still remember the feeling of having planned my death, of it being certain, and a done deal. I can't describe how it feels exactly, but it's almost a physical coldness. so that's where I need advice. how do I stop feeling like this?",1
"Today's my birthdayToday's my 21st birthday. I live at home, don't have a car, am sort of drifting through university, and don't have any friends. Like really no friends. I am the most uninteresting, awkward person. No one wished be a happy birthday outside of my parents. It's my 21st. You're supposed to go party and have a good time. I've never even been to a party. I don't know a single person outside my immediate family.

No one talks to me at school. No one sits by me or even notices me. No one invites me to do anything with them. In labs, I am always the awkward kid that gets assigned to another group of people that already know each other. I used to rock climb, but you can't do that without friends. I have no hobbies. No skills. No passions.

Really, there's nothing here for me. No one would miss me if I was gone. The world wouldn't even notice. My parents would cry, and then they'd get over it. And my chapter would be done. I don't make any affect on anyone or anything. I am a pathetic, lonely, friendless, uninteresting loser.

I've never been so close to actually going through with it as I am right now. No one even knew it was my birthday. I didn't do anything today except sleep and play xbox. On my 21ST FUCKING BIRTHDAY. If ever there's an indicator that no one cares for you and you don't make the slightest difference, it's that. I'm fucking done with the bullshit of pretending to be interested in anything. Pretending that I don't just go to school and hide in a study alcove instead of going to class. Pretending that my grades aren't atrocious and that I'll be forced to drop out with 25k in debt. Pretending that I come home every night and lock myself in my room and cry. I have no one to talk to. It's all bullshit, and I'm done.",1

I have given away everything else through my bad choices and my bad treatment of everyone else.

I have the means, the motive, and endless opportunities. I have to keep them close at all times, otherwise I don't have control.  If I decide that this is the time, but I don't have the tools with me, then I actually DON'T have that control that I thought I did.

&amp;#x200B;

I wish I could talk to someone about this, but I can't.  I start to try to talk to my friends about it. But as soon as I get, ""Are you ok, man?"" I shut down and change the subject.  I want to talk about it, but I don't want to give away the last tiny bit of my private inner self that I have left.  When I got anywhere near it with my therapist, he started talking about ""concerns for my safety.""  I know what that means and it would only make things much, much worse.

Going back to school for first time in 3 weeks tmrw and just f e a r idk how to interact with real ppl anymore like actual ppl. Like in the psych ward everyone truly understood each other there was no stigma about self harm or suicide and u could talk about it freely and no one would mind. There you didnâ€™t have to pretend you were ok. 

So tmrw i gotta go to school put on a smile and pretend Iâ€™ve been sick with a bad cold or smth and not in a psych ward for attempting sewerslide and just yeah. I gotta ton of work to make up and idk what the teachers are gonna think and my grades are gonna be so shit and yeah lowkey still wanna die but I gotta pretend I donâ€™t. 

To anyone whose been thru this before got any advice for me?",0
"Should I just kill myself?Ok trying to make this as brief as possible:

Mental breakdown around January last year. Went from an extremely heavy and skinny smoker who only ate garbage to a gym rat. Eating, eating, eating, 4000 calories per day, becoming strong.

However: I get filled with regrets because the contrast is so huge. I feel like I'm about to die. Also get so fucking angry at myself and feel like the biggest failure ever. I mean... Who smokes!? Who neglects his health!? Only losers do that. Self-esteem below zero. Suicidal thoughts.

I contact my ex to talk about it. Look up to her because she's 8 years older. I start it off on the wrong foot with extremely negative texts and I feel like I have to explain myself. She constantly says something I want to reply to and then blocks me so I keep making new accounts. One time she says 'you didn't change a bit and only went backwards' so I make a new account one last time to reply with 'but I did change'... Then she explodes. Writes a message to hurt me as much as possible and says she will never reply again. Says shit like 'you'll never learn how to live your life'... Saying that to me in my situation is pure poison for my brain. It's black on white and becomes engrained in my brain.

Every single minute of the day it keeps repeating in my head. I'm so frustrated and sad that she said that to me because it completely ruins my mental health and makes me feel hopeless. I can't cope with it and constantly write messages and delete them again only to write them again everyday explaining myself and apologizing. She never replies. After like 4 months of doing that shit she gets rid of her instagram 😓 I wrote a last extremely personal e-mail to her work, but she left that company so it got forwarded to her co-workers. Holy shit. 

Conclusion: I've turned into a stalker. Should I kill myself? I can't live with the embarrassment and shame...",1

"There's a Black hole in my heart and relapseHello everyone I don't know where to start but I've lived through some pretty very serious and constant emotional trauma and neglect as a child up to my teenager years. When I decided to leave the environment by that time there was nothing left of my soul, it had been completely and utterly destroyed. I'm 21 now, almost 22 and I don't feel human anymore and I'm disconnected from my emotions but at the same time I love and appreciate life even if I cant feel the full range of emotions anymore, anyway. I was and am completely alone and I've realised I must rely on my own strength and will power for me to survive.

I've always been trying to improve myself and be better everyday. I workout, eat healthy, I'm a university student and I'm going to therapy and psychiatrist for years because I want to be better but there is also a downside because I also used to use alcohol and other drugs to self medicate during the worst periods of my life. I've blacked out countless of times and was an alcoholic for awhile (there is a part of me that wants self destruct) but I managed to kick it without any help from anyone(or so I thought). 

I've been sober from alcohol for 5 months now but last night I blacked out when I was drinking with my friend. I dont  remember what happened but he kicked me out of his house or I was an idiot and decided to leave. I don't know if I threatened him or if I was being an asshole or whatever but I know it was bad.

I woke up today and I absolutely hate and disgusted with myself because no matter how much I try to better myself and live a good life, there is something in my core that is just broken with the centre being a black hole. I almost always feel empty inside even though objectively I know there is meaning in my life and things have been going good for me lately but I just cant feel it. I'm suffering from the trauma and abuse everyday one way or another and I'm in a lot pain and suffering in my mind especially when it comes to relationships with people and thats why when I blackout I might hurt someone even though I dont want to hurt anybody. I'm a pacifist. 

Every day and night there is a never ending struggle for suicide for years. I can't take this anymore, I want to live but not like this and I'm starting to believe death is the only solution because I just want to all of my suffering to end and maybe I can finally find some peace. I know for a fact if I had an I to a gun I would pull the trigger without a second thought. I dont want to hurt anyone else anymore with my actions and I know the people I have effected wont see this but I'm sorry for everything ive done and all the pain I've caused. That person wasnt the real me I hope you can forgive me",1

"Mental DisorderI never used to be as sad as I am. Hell, when I was a kid I was happy as shit. Now I teeter from extremely depressed to just okay. Sometimes it gets so bad and last so long. I just don't want to deal with it. I have told my family about it and it just ends up with medication. Medication[paxil] that fucks with my sexual functions. Seriously, nothing should mess with that, it is top priority in stress relief and when you take that away it just makes my depression worse. When I told my dad about that he laughed. For the month that I took it it didn't help much at all. So I tried the next thing and started working out with my dad. Nothing.    
I don't know if my depression was triggered by hormonal changes in my body during adolescence or the concussion that I got approximately 5 months before I started to become depressed. (hit my forehead on pavement going ~12-15 mph no medical attention, felt fine) Honestly didn't think about that incident until recently. 
 I have a single job (cashier), part time only 2 days a week and that is a huge stress on me. I just feel so incapable of dealing with working.    
Since this depression started I never felt like I could ""make it"". Like one day I will just off myself in the future when it reaches that point of not being able to deal with the stress( a full-time job, not being able to make enough money for living, etc) I am constantly being stressed about getting kicked out too, and I know where I would go if I was.

"Was starting to feel better, but after a bad breakup I feel worse than everI was in my first relationship for 6 months. It was the best time of my life and the only time I’ve ever felt genuinely loved. The relationship was quite intense, it moved quickly, she came out as trans (mtf), and I was depressed. 

Four weeks ago I had a breakdown and broke up with her. I didn’t want to, and she agreed to get back together. That lasted for a week before she said she needed to take a break to find herself. And then last week she told me that my depression killed her love for me a few months ago. That means that she lied about loving me for months. And to make things worse I just started on my path to getting better. I just started therapy, exercising, eating well, and going out with friends. But she said that she didn’t love me and didn’t want to try again. How could she lie to me for months like that?

She broke up with me during school holidays and I was fine. I blocked her on everything and didn’t have to see her. But today was our first day back. And I had to watch her be happy with her friends and not even glance at me. And I had to hear her voice and it ruined me. I had felt suicidal at times during the relationship but with therapy I had stopped feeling that way. But now I just feel like doing it again. The person I care about the most in the world doesn’t even think about me. I spend my time wanting her to ask if we can try again but she doesn’t even look at me. 

My family situation isn’t good, and I have no close friends. And now that she’s gone there’s no one left to care. She’s never coming back. And I don’t get to see my therapist for another 7 weeks because there were no appointments available. I’m considering just taking all the pills downstairs. I don’t really have much of a future, I get average grades, look average, am infertile, have neglectful parents, and more.

Everything hurts so much. She was such a beautiful and unique person and she doesn’t Love Me anymore and never will. And I have to watch her be happy without me for every single day of the year. And then I have to go home to my neglectful father and schizophrenic mother. And then I get updates on my dying grandma. I hate the life I have. 

If you read this then thank you. I don’t know what to do right now. I’m hurting a lot.",1

"Idk what to do anymoreI have fucked up my life so many times in the past, like bad fuckups, moving states, homelessness, tons of regrets... I am so tired of this shit, I just want to die. Its going to happen one day anyways... the only thing stopping me is the pain it would bring to other people but i feel so much pain myself that its almost unbearable... i have told one person i have suicidal thoughts, she was a close ex family member (brother married her) she said she would schedule an appointment with the doctor but that was over half a year ago, i tld her that i thought i was getting better, and she never replied to that. noone knows these feelings i have, and theyre so strong... most days i get through just fine but when it all boils down to it and im stuck alone just thinking to myself, i just hate where i have ended up in life, im so disappointed in myself, and i dont have a job right now, i can barely keep one of those for too long, i always fuck it up somehow, and all my friends, the 4 or 5 friends i have, all go have fun and every time i hang out with them i just feel like a burden because i feel like im just being a bum around them and i really hate that, i really wish i had a job so i could be parts of their activities, but even when i do have income, i still feel so lonely, i feel like noone really likes me, they just think im annoying and a burden.... im paranoid as hell, which is just not fun, it really sucks on a day to day basis... i never went to college, idk what im doing with my life, idk where i am going... im living with my parents again, unfortunately, but i cant even talk to them because i barely know them, and i dont want them to think like they failed me... even though they kind of did, i couldnt let them know i have suicidal thoughts run through my head... 


i just am tired, spiritually, emotionally, mentally.... im underweight... my back kills me, and its just going to get worse through out the years... idk what to do, i just want to cry but its like ive cried all my tears now i am just.... here... i feel like all i do is fuck things up, so why should i stay? if i was gone, there would be nothing i could fuck up anymore... i feel like i cant talk to my friends because theyre not the talking type... idk... i just want to sleep... im so sad, and despaired, and broken... my thoughts are insane, and if i told anyone they would just think i am insane, so i cant even tell people what i truly believe and think..... idk why im posting this, i guess mainly just to get it off my chest... thx for reading, and sorry for the grammar and whatever else....",1

"I know your hurting and I don't think you're crazy!(RANT!!)There are people in life who want things to get better for them, and are frustrated with not seeing success or getting results. If you are someone  who is like this, I just wanted to say to you that you are not alone nor are you so screwed up that you are beyond help. Because this is likely not the case.

I would think its more accurate to say that, if there was any actual proven method or help out there for you to get better, its likely that by now, you somehow would have acquired it already.

For some reason I tend to randomly research the rates of suicide and depression in America where I live. I don't recommend anyone do this since the results are pretty depressing and might trigger you. :)

A lot of what I read online, or when I speak to people in person, is mostly a form of shaming and blaming, and filled with misconceptions(misunderstandings) about what is really going on inside a person. 

People that have depression or exhibit any behavior trait that may be seen as a mental illness are covertly and overtly shamed and ridiculed in the society I live in. We are called names like retarded, crazy, weird, or psychopaths, just because we make other people feel uncomfortable with themselves. This can happen to anyone anywhere, whether they're at work, school or just about in the general public. 

I also experience something I call ""psych-shaming"", which to me means being stigmatized(victimized) by the very people who are supposed(claim) to help you. An example of some of this is, a common statement being passed off as fact I hear often: 
  
        ""The reason why most people don't get better from depression is because they refuse to seek(and maintain) treatment"".

The main point to my story here is basically an analysis and interpretation of some of the facts I came across online, regarding things like suicide and depression;

I actually do like to research and read some of this stuff, and my conclusion from what I have read is that; when it comes to things like suicide and depression, the mental health professional community has done basically ""ZERO"" for anyone in the past few decades and the data for that is overwhelming. Meaning people are not getting better, the opposite is actually what is happening. To me, this is the main reason why ""psych-shaming"" exists as a way to detract from the fact that the therapies(advices) and medicines the industry has developed in the past few decades, while they have kept many people employed and enriched, have done next to nothing to impact the numbers of those who suffer positively and beneficially. 

The reason why the only the only choice you have as an alternative to suicide is to search  within yourself, is because there is no where else you are going to find it. 

So... Good Luck everybody!",1

"It's beating me down.I'm 15. 15 years old. In 9th grade. I have pending drug charges from when I was caught with 23 20mg Adderall pills at school in September. In January I landed myself an ambulance ride to the hospital after a shroom + 4-AcO-DMT experiment with two other friends which is going to cost my parents a tremendous amount of money. I feel fucking awful putting them through all of this bullshit. I disclosed my (past) regular drug use to my parents. Weed, Adderall, Xanax, Tramadol, Oxycodone, Hydrocodone, mushrooms, LSD, 25i-NBOMe, coke, DXM, I fucked up. I wasn't doing it to feel happy, to escape reality, I was just curious I guess and had other friends around me who were curious as well. I never partied, did everything alone or with small groups of friends in good environments, but I can't help but think I've permanently wrecked my already flawed brain chemistry. I'm gifted, and diagnosed with ADHD, OCD, and GAD at age 11. I've completely abstained from drug use, and the fact that I haven't even considered using anything makes me feel as though I've done everything to myself completely by choice. I feel completely overwhelmed with guilt and I am disgusted with myself for putting my parents through this. The amount of adderall I possessed when I was caught implied intention to distribute, not to mention school grounds, and a felony will fuck up the rest of my life if I decide to continue it. I'm nearing the edge, and though I'm surrounded by my loving family and plenty of close friends, there's some driving force telling me none of it matters and to end it already.",1

"I'll tell you my storyI was scared of my father since I can remember. I was mentally and physically abused. More mentally tho. Physically it wasn't ""that bad"" - he spanked me every time I did something wrong. He also often jerked me. But I wasn't really a naughty kid. It was more like: your daughter is crying, because she's fucking 5? Yeah, spank and jerk her, then yell at her to let her know she's the worst. It still wasn't that bad, I mean, I mostly didn't even have any bruises. But I started being scared every time he was close to me. My mother wasn't a good person, but she sometimes hugged me after my father did something to me. She didn't stand for physical abuse. 

Both of my parents were always insulting me. For everything. I thought I was the worst, that everyone hated me, that I was not worth talking with. It felt like I was doing everything wrong. I've felt like a failure even in fucking kindergarten. 

I went to the elementary school. I was very shy and scared of meeting new people (*""They'll hate me as everyone does.""*). I met one girl, we became friends and you know what? After two years or so she hit me in the face with a metal gate and said I was ugly and that no one liked me. We were fucking 8 years old, like??? I didn't even know kids can be so terrible for others. But well, she was right - no one from our school liked me. They started making fun of me, like, you know, a shy girl without any friends won't tell anyone, won't have anyone by her side, won't do shit with whatever you'd do to her. 

When I was 10 they started also jerking me, sometimes hitting me, stealing my food, water or other things. So, you know, I was abused at school and at home. I had no one. I couldn't feel safe anywhere. 

When I was 12 I had the worst argument with my parents in my whole life. My mother told me that I had ruined her life and that she hated me. I got to know that they didn't want to have a kid and didn't really love each other - they decided to get married bacause my mother got up the duff. So they blamed me for ruining their life. That was the first time my mother hit me. I started crying. Like, that really broke me (*""Am I really that terrible that even s h e hits me? I must really be the worst. I fucking hate myself.""*). My father got annoyed by my crying and started jerking me, I fell on the floor and started crying even louder - I felt so fucking bad, I was so done. He shouted something like ""Stop crying or I'll fucking kill you"". I said ""Then just finally do it"". Then he put his hands on my face. Tightly. I couldn't breath. I was so fucking scared. I thought I was going to die. 

I started having panic attacks. Now I know that situation was a main reason. But I found this out few years later. I also started cutting myself. I was 12 and I wanted to fucking die. I hated myself, my life, I hated everything. I just wanted it all to stop.

I went to the middle school. I had one friend. She was abused by the same persons in our previous school, so we decided to hold together. Many people didn't like me. As always. I wanted to be an emo/a punk (I don't really know, I just wanted to show people I was different, I guess), but well, that was a good reason for others not to like me (I think they wouldn't like me anyway). I and this friend met a group of people once, they wanted to become friends with us and I got really exited, because I've never really had friends (except this girl, of course). We started meeting pretty often. 

We were 14, they were 15-16 and they were already drinking really frequently. Year later they also started smoking weed. I and this friend, let's call her X, got into this too. We started drinking and smoking (cigarettes and weed). We thought it was cool, you know, you could just stop thinking for a moment and all your problems didn't matter for a while. *For a while.* 

I also went to the psychiatrists for the first time, my parents still didn't really care. I started taking meds but they've never worked. (Wow, maybe that's because my coping mechanisms were alcohol and fucking drugs.)

Time passed, we were 16. I and X went to the same high school, she got a new boyfriend and didn't have time for me anymore. But that was okay, right? I still had this group of friends, who liked drinking and smoking with me, right? Well, *no.* 

They started taking other drugs and designer drugs (or legal highs? I don't really know how you call it, hope you know what I mean). So I knew designer drugs were a real shit, God knows what they're really made of. But I didn't care, I felt like shit and I wanted to die, so for real, who cares. But well, I often had panic attacks or anxiety attacks after doing drugs, I still liked it, 'cause I could *stop thinking about all this shit for a while*, but it wasn't worth it. I stopped after about two months. I prefered alcohol. And meds. Yes, I was overdosing fucking meds instead of doing drugs. I even had serotonin syndrome once. But again I stopped after about two months. Because I didn't feel okay after doing drugs, after overdosing meds, after getting drunk. I just didn't feel okay at all. 

X and her boyfriend started taking designer drugs really often. Everyday. They were high every single day. Even during lessons. I was scared, I didn't want them to take them. They had changed and I wanted my friends back. I wanted them to stop. But nothing worked, they didn't want to stop. Every single day I saw them like this. 

I stopped meeting that group of friends. I didn't want to hang out with junkies anymore. But one day I tried to reach X or her boyfriend. I texted them thousand times, I called thousand times and there was no respond. Aftyer few hours I called these old friends and they said only that something bad probably had happened. I immediately ran to the place I thought they would be at. And I found them. Barely alive. They overdosed and took something weird. They didn't even know what. They were so aggressive, trying to hit me, screaming so damn load, crying. I was frightened. But I called their parents and an ambulance. Few hours later their parents and police wanted me to come to the hospital and tell them what I knew. My parents were so fucking mad, they thought I was a junkie. They didn't believe me.

X and her boyfriend were unconscious for few days. I was so damn terrified. Their parents started to hate me. They said everything was my fault and that I was the worst friend they could have. They blamed me for everything even when the doctor said that I saved their fucking lifes. Because I did. If I didn't run there and call an ambulance, they would be dead. But no one cared, they just hated me. As everyone always does. 

They got expelled from the school. I was alone again. I had no one again. *Everyone* thought I was a junkie. People from my class, teachers. Everyone. I felt like shit every single day at this school, teachers wanted me to fail the year. I had to change school.

Now I'm 18, I'm in the final year of high school. X is in another school but we still talk sometimes. Not really often tho. In my school I have no one. I feel like shit every day. I hate my life and I hate myself even more. I often cut myself. I don't drink nor take drugs. I prefer being sober. I've been taking meds for about 3 years now and they've never worked. I have health issues so I often miss my classes. It's not really my fault, I'm doing my best. I often throw up, maybe that's because of so much stress, I don't know. It's just like... I go to school and few minutes before the lesson I just feel so overwhelmed, I go to the bathroom to throw up or have a panic attack there. Headmistress doesn't understand this and want to expell me. In my fucking final year. 

I just have enough. I don't know what I should do anymore. I don't wanna live, but I don't think I really wanna die. I just want to be good, but it's never been good. I don't believe I'll pass final exams or get to the university. I've always thought I'd be dead at this time. I've never planned anything, cuz I was like ""well, I'll just kill myself anyway"". And that's literally the only option I see. Suicide. I'm a failure, I can't do anything right, I can't even live properly. I won't be able to just go to university, find a job and live a normal life. I can't. I won't make this. I'm too weak, I'm such a mess. I just... I just don't want to live like this anymore. 

I don't really know what's the point of this post. I needed to get all these thoughts out of my head. Thank you for reading (if anyone's gonna read this). I hope you'll have a good day.",1

"The world hates all of us, and I hate it right back.It was about six months ago that I first seriously considered killing myself. I've devoted my entire life to service. I served in my church growing up. I served a grueling two year volunteer mission. Now I serve in the military. My Christian background taught me that the key to happiness was obeying God and serving others. To find happiness, seek to make others happy. 
You're unhappy? Just serve harder. Give more of yourself. Give all of yourself. I've given my entire damn life and you know what? Every fucking moment of my life I wish I could just not feel anymore, because all I feel is loneliness and pain. 
I've held on this long because I've seen what suicide does to loved ones and I don't want to do that to my siblings, but I'm just not willing to live an entire life this way. 
A few days ago I said fuck it, before I kill myself I may as well see if there's something I haven't tried yet that will make me feel happy. So I threw my promises to God away and went out and got black out drunk and fucked a prostitute. Now I just feel worse. 
Last night I went to a lake near my house to end it. It has a nice view is all. It would be nice to die in a place like that. I had my gun strapped to my hip, it's easy to conceal, 9mm. But you know, after a few hours I realized something.
Maybe I've been wrong this whole time. Maybe people aren't meant to be happy. Maybe my expectations are just too high. I'm thinking now that existence is pain, and happiness comes into our lives only often enough to convince us to suffer more while we wait to feel it again, like some twisted drug. So fuck this world. Fuck this world where the only thing it seems that can give you any protection from pain is control, and power, not selflessness. 
So I'm not killing myself just yet. There are still options I haven't explored, so I have some hope. But when those options are exhausted it's fucking over. And in the meantime, I'm turning into a right hateful person. At least anger is a fucking break from the sadness. Fuck. ",1

"Omegle chat with suicidal manI was on omegle screwing around, and avoiding the asl kids as best I could, when a man asking for help came up. He began by telling me he was going to kill himself and he didn't have any reason to live. Now it might have just been bullshit but I tried to help out. I told him to call his therapist (he did a few times but refused) I told him to call a suicide hotline (he already had 3 times and they said they would send an ambulance if he called again.) He didn't want to go to a hospital or clinic because he said he would lose his job.
He also told me he was developing korsakoff's syndrome, he couldn't see his son anymore because he plead guilty to beating him (even though he said he didn't actually do it), his mom has Alzheimer's and doesn't recognize him, he's divorced, alone, and by the end of it I couldn't think of a single thing to say to the man that would in any way help him. 
I got a bit angry and depressed (seriously, I just wanted to screw around on Omegle during my work shift) and told him once again to call the suicide hotline because I couldn't help. The last thing he said before logging off was ""I think I'm ready to die now."" That's kind of stuck in my head right now.

Anyways, was there anything I could have done differently? What could I do if this situation comes up again either online or in the real world?

Also, I feel responsible somewhat. Some random guy put this burden in my hands and i didn't respond as well as I could. Am I right to feel this way?

Much love, SW

"I feel like it's just me against the world and I'm ready to quitI feel so alone.  My parents can't cope with the depression I've had since I was 15. 

I can't get on medication to help me. Thr loops they have me jumping through to get help is ridiculous. Went to thr emergency room twice in two years and they sent me home. Second time they called me a junkie. I have never smoked pot in my life let alone abuse pills. 

I just want a healthy happy life. But everything has been a giant sinkhole.  I got a degree. First person in my family to get a degree. And I'm working a min wage job. Csn barely afford everything. Haven't made a payment on my student loans in two years because I can't afford it. I tried to get help but they just tell me I make too much money. 

Because of this my credit is awful.  Can't marry my fiance.  Love him to death but I can't bring him down with me.  

Ill never afford to be a mother like I've always wanted. Fiance doesn't make the same as me.  Less actually. Min wage part time. His parents have spoiled him so fucking bad that he can't do anything. Can't cook doesn't know how to clean. Is only interested in aging on his stupid fucking apple devices and leaves me to do all thr house work. 

And when he tries. Which I appericate, he fucks up. And instead of saying sorry or tries to fix it he just gives up and goes back to his devices.  

I haven't had a day off in two months. He keeps promising he'll help out so I csn have a day off. But nothing. I call my parents to chat and their advice has and will always be ""what you think we don't experience that? Deal with it.""

I tell them I'm ready to jump. ""Just be happy!"" It doesn't fucking happen like that! 

All I hear about is how happy and successful my two sisters are. And I'm here just constantly thinking about how easy it would be to just jump from my balcony. It's certainly high enough. And it would be over. The pain could stop.  

That's all I want. I want the pain to stop. I want to be happy. But I'm not. I'm constantly sad. I'm constantly stressed snd I'm just a failure in every regard of my life. It would just be easier to end it than continue on. ",1

"I've been feeling extremely lonely. I need some guidance.It all started when I went to my friend's place last weekend. It's a very long story, and there are a lot of details that I could point out that makes this whole thing more understandable, but I wish not to delve too into it because of it would take ages to write.

To try to summarize what's been going on; we've been friends for almost 5 years (we went to the same school and kept in touch after we both graduated). I visited her place over the weekend and things were going sorta fine. She had recently installed Tinder and was kind of obsessed with the whole thing, texting random people she matched with and just being on the phone a lot in general. Now this wouldn't really bother me (we're not in a relationship so she can do whatever she wants, right?), but I guess I kinda felt neglected and unappreciated. Like it didn't matter that we were hanging out.

Now we both did things together. Went out to eat, sat down in a pub and had a few drinks, just normal fun stuff like that. But I couldn't shake the feeling like I didn't mean anything to her. She kept trying to get friends to join and stuff like that. I don't know why this hurt me more than it should, but it really affected my mood and I felt like shit.

A lot more small stuff happened like that, but like I said previously, it would take too long to type out. Skip to Sunday and everything was off. I feel like nobody cares for me or wants to talk to me. I've talked to her a few more times since the weekend but she's been feeling distant and even when I made plans to talk to her after she got home from a friends house, she didn't even call me and the next day when I asked what she's been up to, she told me she was busy talking to some Tinder guy the whole night and didn't get any sleep. Why does this bother me so much all of a sudden? I almost feel like I've developed feelings for her and it scares me, because I've never felt this way for her before. Whenever I talk to my friends I just feel really hollow and sad. What the fuck is going on with me? I feel like I'm missing something in my life and I don't know what it is.

Sorry if this post is a big mess, but I need to get this off my chest. I feel so undesirable at the moment and it's making me extremely depressed. Do you guys have any advice for me? What should I do in a situation like this?

Thanks for reading...",1

If youâ€™re a parent reading this talk to your fucking kids and make sure they are doing okay and make sure they know youâ€™re open to talk.

Iâ€™ve seriously thought about it. I doubt I will but still I donâ€™t think film study grade should have a student thinking about how easy it would be to just do it. My school is so high pressure and we donâ€™t get any mental breaks. Itâ€™s top 100 and Iâ€™m not saying that to brag Iâ€™m saying that so you all might understand how much shit we put up with.

"I think it's time.I could turn this into 3,000 words but I think I'll put this in basic terms chronologically.

* Mum turns out to have lung cancer from asbestos
* Mum dies 2 months later
* Go into a relationship with friend of 6 years
* Girlfriend breaks up with me ""because I'm selfish""
* Ex doesn't want to be friends with me
* I don't have many friends or people I can talk to
* Tried attempting suicide 4 days ago but failed

I miss my ex-girlfriend a lot and she says she misses me too but she can't trust me. I deleted her number and her Facebook. My friend is still friends with her, I told him how I felt and he got into contact with her, explained the situation. My ex-girlfriend says ""Just let him get on with it. He's just being selfish and thinking about himself again.""

I won't go into explicit methods of attempting but I think it's frustrating that I can't do it. I want to do it, sure but I physically can't. People will be sad about me but I miss my mum and I want somebody to love. Somebody to hold me at night and tell me that everything will be okay.",1

I've tried too many different things &amp; I have no gun access.

ive thought about stealing my housemate's blade

"day one of anti depressant withdrawalI was offered a Xanax in place of my medication today. It was the first one I’ve taken, and I took it at the peak of my shift. I didn’t have the lingering anxiety I always have at work, so that’s a plus. I worked my 8 hours. Felt...fine? Although, the problem started to accumulate once I got home. I began feeling lethargic; so tired I could barely talk or think. I went to lay in bed, and physically felt as if I sank into the mattress and couldn’t move. At this point, I felt my depression overcoming me. I knew I would be having a terrible next couple of days after this, and there was nothing I could do to even prepare for it. I was stuck. I recall calling my roommate, telling them the situation that was taking over me. They proceeded to tell me there was nothing they could do to help me. After that? Darkness. I blacked out. Once I woke up, it was midnight. I was frantic &amp; in all honesty confused why I didn’t have any missed calls or messages. I sent a text to my roommate asking him why he hadn’t checked up on me in the last 4 hours, only to get the response, “what? I just talked to you on the phone 30 minutes ago.” It then clicked. 
I looked through my calling history... 4 calls to roommate...3 calls to my ex....5 calls to my dad..oh god. What did I say? 
I was informed that I confessed to my dad about my only relieving thought being is that I could kill myself at any time I wished to. What parent thinks that’s the call they’re going to get from their child that they haven’t heard from in weeks? 
At this time, I still don’t know what I had said to my ex, which makes me severely anxious.
Well. Here I am. Past midnight. Trying to catch up on everything I needed to do today... definitely not looking forward to waking up at 630 AM for my opening shift. 
I feel absolutely awful. Drained. Nauseous. Anxious. Physically and mentally incapacitated. I’m so afraid of what my next few days...weeks...MONTHS...hold. Can I please just shake the hand of death? ",1

"Today I feel like dying

Dear Reddit, 

I am a fuck up.

I feel haunted.. 

Got in to three car accidents within a 2 month span. Totaled my car on Mischieve Night... Lost my job on the same night. Don't understand how or why I survived such a horrific accident. I don't understand why god wants me live and I'm pissed he didn't let me die.

My friends don't support me or understand how I feel. My family isn't there for me either nor do they care or understand what I am going through. I'm afraid to talk to the guy I'm dating about my issues because I don't want him to worry about me, but more accurately I'm afraid of him finding out how screwed up I actually am and then stop talking to me. 
I'm in such a financial hole I started to have sex with older men for money. I can't remember the last time I felt loved. I can't remember the last time I felt genuinely supported. I feel like I've never felt joy. I'm 22 and I can't remember what it was like to be a child. I can't feel joy. I think sex is the closest thing to happiness I'll ever achieve. I'm sure I'll end up addicted to hard drugs if I continue this lifestyle, but I don't know how to stop nor have a good reason to. I'm considering donating all my stuff to Goodwill and planning out my last days. I turn 23 next month, may commit suicide before then. ",1

"I was falsely convicted of rape and spent two and a half years in prison. I can't get past this.Four years ago I had just graduated from university with a degree in engineering. I managed to get a junior position with a very good company. Everything was on track. One of my best friends at the time was a girl I went to college with. I had feelings for her, but I never said anything because she was with someone else - at this point in time they had just gotten engaged. One night we had been to a concert with a group of people. I was the designated driver. I drove everyone else home and she was the only one left in the car. She had left her stuff at my apartment before we went to the concert, so rather than have to drive all the way across town again she decided to stay at my place. It was late so we hung out and watched a movie. To make a long story short, we ended up having sex. She was a little intoxicated, but knew what she was doing. She kissed me, she unzipped my jeans. I certainly didn't rape her. When I woke up the next morning she was gone. The next thing I knew, I was being questioned by police. I told the police the truth -she stayed at my apartment and we had sex- which worked against me in court. That coupled with the fact that she is considerably more attractive than I am, essentially sealed it. The next month is a blur but I ended up getting sentenced to 4 years in prison.

I got out after 2 and a half years because of good behaviour. The only thing that got me through my time was that I knew I would be free one day. I thought that everything would be better once I got out. Unfortunately, that is not the case. My friends have all moved on and don't want to be associated with me. Initially my family believed me, but after I was convicted none of them supported me, they cut ties completely. After I got out I tried to start my own software company, but it quickly failed. No engineering company wants to hire a convicted rapist. I have been to so many job interviews, but I never get the job, or I will work for a day or two before being told that they can't hire me. I managed to get a job as a forklift driver so I now have enough money to live. But I don't know if it's even worth it anymore. I've always wanted to be an engineer. I wanted a job that was a challenge. On top of that I'm short and average looking, so it's going to be almost impossible to find a woman if I'm not successful or at least somewhat wealthy. 

I did everything right. I worked hard in school, treated everyone with respect, took care of my family. Yet everything can be over because a woman lied to protect her relationship? This isn't fair. This isn't fucking fair. Everything that I have worked so hard for is out of reach. I am tired of fighting. Even if I did somehow manage to gain some kind of professional recognition, this will always be looming over my head. ""Oh my god, did you hear [thisisitformeimdone] raped a woman?"" I can't do this any more. I want to die more than anything. People would cheer if I killed myself. ""The rapist is dead."" At the very least it might make ""her"" feel a little bad for everything she has done to me.",1

"I should just get it over with alreadyI’m this point where everyone is sick of me and no one will help. I saw my psychiatrist and explained I’ve been having breakdowns, panic attacks, and thoughts of suicide but when I met with her, I was in a upper mood. She told me I seemed fine and I would get over it. I went to my primary doctor but they didn’t feel comfortable with making changes but they did make me sign a anti-suicide agreement. Like that’s really gonna stop me. My doctor referred me to a mental health facility to have a medication evaluation. I spent hours there only for them to tell me they can’t see me for another four weeks. 

I’ve struggled with depression and anxiety my whole life. I feel like I’m meant to kill myself. It’s bound to happen some time, I might as well get a jumpstart on the process. 

I feel utterly hopeless. Everything is a constant reminder of what a failure I am. I’m always missing work or am behind because of how I feel. I can’t share anything with anyone because the moment I did at my last job, everyone alienated me. Even though my boss’s son committed suicide. My husband has a high stress job and struggles as well (now and in the past). His work offers confidential mental health support, which he has taken advantage of but somehow, everyone knows about his mental health and now he’s being alienated. He’s fallen back into cutting himself. Seeing his marks just makes me want to end it more. I wouldn’t be such a burden to him if I was gone. He could focus on getting better without having to be weighted down by my baggage. 

My father had a addiction to prescription painkillers.  Now I totally get why - easy to get a hold of and a great means of getting out of your head. 

I’m trying so hard not to do it. I try to think of my husband, our two dogs and two cats and how they wouldn’t understand but I’m at my wits end. ",1

"This hardly feels worth submitting forI haven't had any recent major trauma or upset, I'm just trying to get through with a depression that's been with me for more than half of my life now. I saw a recent post about being ""passively suicidal"" instead of actively and I think that sums it up. I'm on meds, and have been for over two years that although they don't take away the suicidal feelings, htey ""blunt the edges"" enough to make me so apathetic I can't bring myself to try anything. I can barely bring myself to self harm at the moment.

I'm seeing a psychiatric asessment team tomorrow because in theory they'll be able to route me to the department that will best be able to help me. But this is the NHS, so I'll be lucky if I get to speak to a professional once a month. Seeing a rpivate therapist is something I was lucky enough to be able to do before but can't continue with now because of funds. While I feel it was overall beneficial, it also feels a bit like I've dug up all this shit I can't deal with and don't know what to do with and have nowhere to put it. 

In some respects, I've been trying to do better lately. I've cut down on my drinking and my eating is healthy enough that my glucose levels are great. I've recently changed my eating habits in an attempt to bring down my cholesterol levels. In 2012 I was convinced that if I was unhealthy enough for long enough my body would just give up anyway, but this didn't happen. So I feel like making healthier lifestyle choices now will help as a red herring so it doesn't look like I'm at risk of harming myself immediately any more.

I'm so, so sorry, I know that this sub tends to be for people going through specific, horrifying challenges. And that just makes me feel all the shittier for invading on a space for people who have much more right to be here seeking support for. I just feel at a complete loss.

Every time I go past the balcony of our apartment, it's tempting. Every time I'm chopping vegetables, it's tempting. Even if I'm doing something completely unrelated, my head feels flushed with images of me bleeding to death or falling from a great enough height to kill me. But thanks to my meds I can't even plan to act on these feelings anymore. Part of me wants to stop taking them because I can't deal with how angry at myself in a ""FFS, shit or get off the pot"" way.

"Suicidal facebook post - What should you do?A classmate of my niece (14 yr old girl), posted a suicidal message on her facebook page last night.

Did I overreact?  What would you do?

"See myself going nowhere in life. People say ""You're only __ years old, things will get better.""Ohh yea first of all, I'm not a girl, so lots of people might stop reading from this point.

When I was 16 years old I had no friends, never had a girlfriend, had very poor grades, and was unemployed. My life was going nowhere and I could see this was going to continue. I disliked my appearance and height, hoping those things would change as well. People would always say things like ""You're only 16, things will improve for the better,"" and stuff like that.

Fast forward, I'm almost 19 and a half and I have made no progress in life. I have literally no friends, never had a girlfriend, I'm still unattractive and not tall, and my grades are very bad (a solid 2.0) in college. I was very close to losing all my financial aid. I have been going to the gym for 3 years consistently with no progress. I can see that things will never get better even with effort. I am tired of people giving false hope. Age makes things worse if anything.

If I cant get friends, then how can I get a girlfriend? I am a person too, and I am very tired of being alone my entire life. One of my big fears is that ill be mid 20s and still alone. I was alone at 16, 19 and probably the rest of my life, if I live through it. I did manage to get a summer job, and I was always alone while the coworkers were in groups and I was by myself. I am not good looking at all, and I'm sure everything would be better if I were tall and white. I wont ever be able to find someone who likes me for me. My grades can never go up. I don't see myself making any progress in life, and theres no passion for anything. Most of this is because of my low self esteem from being unattractive. Genetics and my low confidence are an issue. I've never asked anyone out either. People don't pay attention to me because of that. Looks are everything. People don't care unless youre rich, dead or good looking. Any advice on how to be good looking, how to get a girlfriend (any way at all), how to get grades up with fear of failing, or how to improve my life in general? Ill take any advice, because things get worse as you get older and I'm sure of that.

When I showed it to other people they thought it was more than likely. When I showed it to a psychologist friend, he said that he assumed it all along but didn't want to say anything.

It bothers me because out of the many other things I lost, I lost a shot at the most perfect girl I could have imagined because of this behavior. She wants nothing to do with me now.

I guess I don't really know what else to say. My negative emotions are insanely strong. All I know is that people aren't supposed to be like me. I spend all of my available energy on fighting my own negative emotions, and I can't do it any more. ",1

"I am feeling suicidal and I need some help.For the past 2 years I've felt like I want to kill myself for various reasons I do not want to explain. I have not committed suicide because of 2 main reasons, how upset/sad my family would be and the question what if this feeling goes away and this would a mistake? Either way after 2 years now I feel like I've gone insane by waiting for my feelings to change and hiding the fact that I feel depressed to my friends and family. I  wanted to keep it a secret this entire time because if I wanted to do something I would have full control and have no friends or family standing in the way but there is a drawback and that is that I can't ask anyone any questions on suicide or anything alike because it would reveal/cause suspicion that I'm suicidal.

&amp;#x200B;

About a week ago I decided that I had enough and wanted to finally commit suicide because a lot my problems in life are getting much bigger and my feelings doesnt seem to be changing anytime soon and I don't want to wait in what feels like hell any longer. After searching up online with a vpn on ways to kill myself, I learned there are no ways to kill myself with a 100% guaranteed to die or anything with a really high percentage that would be available to me.

&amp;#x200B;

I couldn't do any overdose on pills on something and learned that there is a high percentage of people who survive and I would be likely to have some sorta brain damage if I did. I couldn't hang myself because I dont have anything to hang myself from or anything to suspend me except a belt. I couldn't shoot myself in the head because I don't have a gun and I'm a high schooler so I couldn't get one anyway. I couldn't cut myself in anyway because after research I learned that that is the highest suicide attempt that most people survive from and plus it would be a lot of pain before you die. I couldn't do the old toaster in the bathtub because outlets in modern homes have something to stop higher amounts of electricity or something because of that way of attempt and also because bathrooms are really moist. I couldn't that thing were you get a lot of co2 in the car and pass out because that would require my parents to be home from work. I couldn't order and helium tank or gas because obviously I'd be questioned on why I'd be doing that. I couldn't jump from a building because I live in the suburbs where there aren't any tall enough buildings for me to jump from without a huge chance of me surviving the fall and being disabled in some way after that physically or brain damage. I couldnt use chemical products because their are no certain ways I know it would work and I don't want to endanger any family members or oets with any make shift gas or something from products that would linger.

&amp;#x200B;

For the last paragraph I want to ask anyone is believes that people should have the right to take their own life. What way do you thing would be possible to kill myself? I've been considering jumping in front of the metro but I have the feeling I wouldn't be able to get through with that. Please I need an answer because I've now become mad knowing I might not even be able to commit suicide. To anyone that wants to convince to me to live or something, right now Im not really open minded and I don't really want to find a reason to live. I've already tried for the past 2 years so anything you might say I probably had a similar thought already and examined it.

"My parents are royal cunts, and I'm their servant.My parents force me to do tasks that I have no option choice or reasonable ability to do so. The other night for example, I threw up after not feeling good for several days. My father came to me, at 3 am, and all he said was clean it up before he wakes up in the morning. They cut off my internet access early in the night, meaning with schoolwork on top I maybe get 30 minutes to communicate with friends outside of school, 30 minutes where I'm free from my parents. Life has been very depressing since I was young, maybe 9 years old, and I've thought about suicide before, buy never had the balls to do it. My younger sister on the other hand, is also a royal cunt. She got most of the gifts at Christmas, and all I got were some clothes and some iTunes cards which my parents would probably end up getting, since I am an android/windows user.

"[Repost from r/depression]. Need any help I can get with a suicidal friend as fast as possiblesome background: My friend is about 35 years old, I know him through work since about 1,5 years, when he started to work at my company. He is overweight and generally a shy nice guy due to bullying (as he has talked about earlier with me). Because of these traits he has never had a relationship or been with a girl (this is a big issue for him).

However, right now he actually has his dream job. he has spent around 6 years of university studies to get this degree to get this job and he got it. The thing is, he has ""Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder"" (ADHD). This was no problem in school because he got extra time for studying and exams to help him through. But he is about to get fired now with a bad ""repute"" because he cannot handle the job (boss told him last week). I.e. with no further chance of getting a second chance anywhere.

This weekend I had a few friend over for drinks and he was invited. He got tipsy/drunk like everyone else and took me aside and said that this might be the night he will commit suicide due to everything above. I left the party with him to walk in fresh air and talk about it. The thing is, I dont know what to say other than ask him to seek professional help, his situation seems as hopeless to me as with him.

He has two things right now that he values in life, being loved by a woman and being able to manage his dream job. what can I say? Knowing his persona he wont find a woman, its tragic but thats how the world works. And with that type of mental deficiency in our line of work, he was doomed from the beginning. He shouldnt have been allowed to study and build up a debt in the beginning, someone should have stepped in right there :(
HELP! I think its really urgent, I think he already has the means and plan. I know he probably contacted me because he is afraid of going through with it and he is grasping for someone to say the right things, im afraid I will push him into it by saying the wrong thing

i am trying to push through my life but everything i do (or say) turns into a disaster. Everytime i work hard to make my parents proud, i end up disappointing them in some way. i don't know what is wrong with me. i've bottled up bad memories of my past and it seems to haunt me today.

"Friend is suicidal. Should I tell someone?I have a really good friend who is suicidal. As far as I know he doesn't have any concrete plans about when and how. But he tells me that it will happen sometime in the next few years at most. He is very determined, and I honestly believe he will go through with it if nothing happens. 

The problem is that we are internet friends, so to speak. I've never met him personally, and I don't know any of his friends or family. It's also really hard for me to talk to him, as I don't know what to say. This far I feel like I can't be very helpful, and that I'm saying the wrong things. I will read up here on how to improve this, how to talk to him, but I think it's very difficult when I can't see him in person (We live in different countries). 

He claims that the only people he has told about his suicidal thoughts are me and his therapist (who he recently started seeing, according to him). I feel like I can't be entirely sure that he has told everything to his therapist though. Should I reach out to the therapist (I know his name) and give all the information I know, so I can be sure my friend gets the right treatment? Should I try to contact one of his family members who might be in a better position to help him? Or should I just try to provide the best help I can myself, even though I feel like I'm not fit to help? I would love any advice on what to do, as this is a very difficult situation for me. ",1

"I tried to commit suicide when I was about 14 and failed, but I have on odd sense of humor about it?Hello, I'm still new but I'm not sure if this belongs here. But we'll see.

I lived in a very very deteriorated home, a hoarder house. My mom is the one with the affliction and I still in a subconscious way blame her. I know it's just her mind but I can't see why she'd let me and sister live that way. She has this odd mindset that her children are supposed to help HER. When we formed our own problems she began to guilt trip. My mother was virtually absent, if we wanted to hang around her we had to go to HER room. She never took us anywhere and only ever stayed in her nest. We had no amenities; no heat, no bathrooms, no kitchen, no washing machines, and very little food. We had power and water for awhile but that eventually went too. My father left at about age 6, but he made good money and constantly sent so much to our mother whom never used it on us. She was and still is a very loving mother. She simply has mental issues and it sucks. My father spoke to me everyday. Without fail. As a kid I knew that being a single father would suck. I think I've heard people who think like me called empathes. You have to basically read a mind to see how that day was going to go, so I got pretty good at predicting how others feel and would feel. But I'm not sure.

Anyway on to the meat and potatoes. I was 14 and at my lowest point. I remember getting the rope and tying it up and walking into the woods behind my house. I went and found a tree I thought was good. I climbed up I don't know how far but I was about 6 ft off the ground at the end of the rope. I was a pretty heavy kid, and am currently on my way to weight loss! But I tied it to the branch which I jumped on and tested but I was thankfully wrong. I remember sitting there crying for about an hour and then I did it. I sat on the branch and let myself down and then just let go.. I swung for what felt like forever but in reality it was probably 10 seconds or less. Then I heard a crack and the branch let me down. I hit the ground coughed for about 20 mins all the while crying. But I remember after I sat there and looked up at the stars for awhile. I thought to myself ""what else could I do wrong?"" got up and brushed it off walked inside and that noose is still in the backyard of that house. I personally think that it's rather funny and I continue to this day tell it as a ""funny"" story. I know it's odd but humor is one of the only coping mechanisms I believe to positive in my case.",1

"Not sure what I'm doing anymoreThis is probably going to be a lot of rambling and I apologize for that but this is a combination of needing to vent and needing someone to talk to.

I'm 17, I just graduated high school. A year early, I worked my ass off cause I thought it would mean getting out of this house a year earlier. I don't have a good home life. My parents are alcoholics, they both used to hit me though it calmed down a bit. My dad still hits me occasionally. He also used to touch me. Still does, but that has also become a lot less frequent. I don't tell anyone about this. Haven't gone to the police and my mother doesn't believe that it happened. I recently opened up to a guy about all of this, felt safe doing it too. He's the only person I've really told and he just accepted it and tried to help me feel better. I fucked that all up royally though and now I'm pretty much alone. I don't have any friends that aren't online and even my online friends aren't very close to me anymore. I pushed pretty much everyone away. One guy that I was close to moved to Italy and I just fucked up our relationship because it got too fucking hard for me to handle. I couldn't handle the time difference and now we don't talk anymore.

So most days I just play League of Legends and try not to focus on how badly I just want to be done. I have no plan for my life. No direction. I don't let people in. The one person I did let in I pushed away because I couldn't handle him being that close. I couldn't handle anything negative he might say about me and I couldn't handle letting myself be vulnerable to another person.

I don't sleep much anymore. Don't eat much anymore. I don't feel the need to. My whole body hates me right now because it just aches. I've spent most of the day just trying not to throw up because of how badly it hurts right now. I don't know what to do. I fucked up any chance of getting out of this house and I don't know where to go from here. I fucked up my relationship with the one guy I let in and there's no way in hell I can fix that. I pushed him away too much and no guy deserves to be treated like I treated him.

I want very badly to be done. I have multiple attempts and I know that if I get a tiny bit closer to being done I can actually succeed this time. I hate feeling this pathetic, I should be able to handle all of this and just go on like nothing is wrong. But I can't and it makes me feel even more worthless.

My usual internal monologue is a mix of a ceaseless bloodcurdling scream, and thoughts of intense violence. Not violence towards others, towards myself. I have always tried to drown out the screams and vitriolic hatred for myself with being helpful loving and kind to others. I wear a mask of happy helpful love while sulking behind it in a deep deep existential fear of my own hands.

Every. Single. Day. Of my ENTIRE CONSCIOUS EXISTENCE has been a battle. I can count the times my mother, who I have been very close with my entire life, has told me ""wow you seem happy"" on one hand. Don't even need the whole thing.

I self harm regularly. Physically, and emotionally. I rend my flesh, burn myself, subconsciously sabotage everything good that I have. Also sometimes consciously destroy anything good that I have because deep down I feel, no...I know, that I don't deserve it.

I am also an alcoholic. Thanks genetics. Thanks me.

I drink, because when I am sober the angry masochistic voices that make up the vast majority of my psyche are very loud. Very. Very fucking loud. Sober me is a flaccid angry sad fucking mess. Drinking me knows at least at the end of the day I can finally drink and at least quiet the voices. They never stop, but if I get drunk they at least do to and can't quite fuck with me as much. However, sometimes I cross a line and these bastard demons come pouring out of me like an open hydrant. My internal screams of anguish externalize and I subsequently once again self harm. Physically, socially, emotionally I destroy myself *while I'm watching me do it.*

I have reached a breaking point. I am weak, I am tired, I am done.

This world is a fucking joke anyway. An endless stream of psychopathic violent greed with no end in sight. We spent *billions of dollars* on people playing sports ball while half the world starves or is killed or raped or burned or all and everything between. I live in a country that propigates this, run by a pedantic terroristic child more concerned with the perceived size of his hands than his citizens. I cannot get mental health care, because I cannot afford it, because money grabbing antisocial bullshit makes it easier for me to buy a gun and blow my fucking brains out than see a therapist that I can't afford because my ""affordable healthcare"" is more than my rent. My therapy is whiskey. My outlet is my own pathetic worthless existence. I am my own punching bag.

My mother is the only thing tethering me to this life. I love her. I love her so so much. Her brother killed himself in 1995 and I know that if I did the same, she would crumble. Her beautiful heart and soul would decay into nothing and I cannot do that. I can't. 

But I want to. I want the screams to stop. I can't do this anymore. I have buried many close people because they opted out. I have been angry. SO ANGRY AT THEM. Because they hurt me. They hurt our friends, their family, us. But they are free. I want to be free.",1
"StuckThis sucks I hope I can explain everything that's happening and what I feel like.

It's like, do you ever sit back and realize that there have to be ""lesser"" people in life, so that others can feel better than themselves. I am one of those lesser people, or at least, it's how I've labeled myself since I've realized it during my grade school days in fifth grade. 

Like, everyone around me is clearly better, always producing results, and I know they work hard for what they produce. They work so hard, sometimes they cry that they couldn't bring what they knew they could. I feel similar, except I have never brought satisfactory results to the table and I'm not even sure what I'm capable of anymore. It makes me think that maybe I was never capable in the first place. Maybe it's because my parents have always painted me as their starchild who is the best and deserves the best and I grew up believing that until I realized it wasn't true. I have never produced the results my parents believe I can bring and I don't know if it's because they truly believe in me or they just don't want me to cry and they're sensitive to my feelings because I used to go to a psychiatrist for my suicidal thoughts (I don't go anymore, because my parents asked if I didn't need to anymore, and I said yeah because at least I want to live up to SOME of their expectations). 

But wait! Why did I title this stuck again? Right, the results. So about the results I never produce. For the past few months, I have been signing up and applying for entry level jobs (I am just starting my sophomore year in college) so I can have some money and some sort of responsibility. I applied to Disney! And this is just one example. I had a phone interview and my mom was able to hear me respond since we live in the same house haha but. I ended up not passing the phone interview. My mom and dad were like ""But you sounded great! What happened?"" I had not brought up one part of what the job focused on. If they weren't safe, would they not be satisfied? Anyway). My parents said it was Disney's loss but it was also clearly my fault because how could I miss something so obvious!

More about results, I draw as a hobby, but it's one of those hobbies I've been doing for life. Like, I want to sell my art at conventions art. And, like, because I've been drawing so long, average people who believe they themselves can't draw compliment my art, which makes me feel GREAT because it's a skill I've been working on for so long. But, I clearly don't actually... make an impact with my art? It's not as good as I think it is. I can't sell anything and when other people who draw see my art they do that smile that *smile where you know they don't think that much of your art.* And I just realized I could use italics. Going back. I went to a convention once and sold things. Or like. I sold. One thing. I didn't break even and I still haven't broke even technically. I don't know. It's hard to keep track of anything. 

And another thing I can't seem to do. My entire family and everyone around me think I'm naturally studious because I can easily get As and Bs without lifting a finger. And this strategy worked for the longest time. Until it didn't and I just became me being lazy and not understanding how to actually study.

This honestly isn't where it ends haha. So, I know these are all problems. So, I've been trying to get better at them. Not the job one though, that's a recent development. With art, I've been sitting down and studying more techniques, more things I need to understand as an artist (colors, shapes, etc). With studying, I've actually been studying, using whatever techniques suit me!

But like! The results that come out of this? It's the same exact thing with like twice the effort I put out beforehand. How hard I work doesn't matter because it ends up producing the same result every time. What's the point. I don't get it anymore. 

In the end, it just feels like I have an inflated ego and I don't know how to fix anything and get better at anything. I'm so slow, it's horrible. ",1

"Hi all, I really don't know what to do. Would appreciate a helping hand in working out what to doHi everyone. I'm 18 and was a full time trader. I spent around 6 weeks working really hard at what I did and managed to make 4x my initial investment. Well, I was usually really good at managing my losses, but today I lost 95% of my account (£30,000), and that is all of my money pretty much. I dropped out of college to do this as I was really dedicated to making this work. I have very few friends and no partner (I have aspergers so I have a very hard time socialising and such). I genuinely feel like ending everything as now I have almost no money to trade again and this experience has mentally scarred me away from ever considering trading again. I have no qualifications that would enable me to get a job I would enjoy, and really struggling mentally anyway, I was never that happy even when I had a lot more money as my lack of social happiness overrode the highs I got from making lots of money in a short space of time. I genuinely see no way forward anymore and would just like to open up because I have no one to talk to. Thank you. :)",1

"The Dispair Islands and its residents The Void Islands are a group of Islands located on the surface of an almost dead dimension. The Islands are likely alive and they demonstrate their lives by changing position and shape every 279 years. The Island is inhabited by a tribe of natives called ""the Wave Missionaries. In 1478 DC another group of humans came to the islands and pillaged most of them, in 1480 began a war  between the Wave Missionaries and the aggressors.  The Missionaries were led by Hato, the best swordsman in all the Islands, who was gifted by the Wave a set of divine powers. The aggressors came from a never specified location and were led by Irwin Wardlock. The war ended in 1487 after the fall of Fort Hijo. After that Hato decided to pass down his powers to his family. In 1501 he mysteriously disappeared leaving a note saying ""I'll return, I just listened to the Wave calling me, it was not a pleasant invitation. It was a scream of pain"". 371 years later a city is founded after the alliance of the Missionaries and another batch of humans called Londinium. 28 years later a relative of Hato, Grica Wallace Irwin, sets out to find the truth behind the shady actions of duke Abraham Lucas and the fate of his long lost ancestor , Hato",0

You grow up, maybe have a nice childhood, go to college, get a job, pay your taxes and die as a small blip on the radar.

 I don't really care if I'm remembered or not, maybe I'd rather not be? I just want to go knowing I won't hurt anyone else with my decisions? Is that too much to ask for. Sometimes I just look around and wonder what the fuck are we all dong here, what are we striving for? Sure maybe you will be remembered a few generations down the line if you do something of note but what does that really matter? You won't be here, no one you loved will be here. It just doesn't make sense. We are walking around everyday, searching for our own fates,which in the end will mean nothing. The pain isn't worth it.",1

I know they could care less about me. I don't even blame them. 


My situation could get better. Maybe I won't be so stressed anymore after school ends and maybe I'll be in a different surrounding if I move to the UK. But how much better could things really get? I'm still me and that won't change and I hate that. 

I don't want to feel like this anymore. 


Life is just too fucking much for me. Other people can handle this but honestly I'm just so weak. I can't be vulnerable and I'm so afraid of being abandoned but every thing I do as a result of that pushes people away. Days can be good days can be bad but overall it's still a fucking rollercoaster. Even my ""good"" days just aren't worth it.

"I’ve had a feeling for a while now, this life was always meant to be miserable and that it would end in a similar note but, is it avoidable?TW: some terms that might be delicate

Hey everyone happy holidays
Not a very orthodox opening for a post on this sub, isn’t it? Ha, anyways....I’ll go straight to the point listing the main stuff so it gets more readable(?) 

📍I’ve been suicidal since like august with waves of it coming and going in different intensities. I am diagnosed with depression and GAD, got off meds this year .
📍The way I see life, lives have -in lack of a better term-purposes...like, maybe in this life you are meant to thrive and be happy or to have a hard road to the top but with a good lesson learned, or if you are like me, you are just a background character, someone meant to be unhappy, because there also has to be unhappy endings in the world you know? 
📍My life from the beginning has been a sad story, I’ve move past every happy/mentally positive philosophy there is, saying that it’s all up to you to be what you want, maybe I am just meant to be a sad person with a shitty life and a pathetic ending, and I’ve accepted it.
📍However, from time to time, I wonder if that’s actually not true, if maybe my life will not end in misery of on a sour note because no matter how hard I try every time I try to look into what the future might bring, I see myself still being unhappy and eventually taking my own life.
📍is it maybe a final silver lining? A trick my brain plays on me based off it’s own survival instinct? I know it might be. A lie, something my brain makes in order to avoid self destruction....but, what if it isn’t? Maybe it’s something else from within me that knows it doesn’t necessarily have to be a sad story.
📍As you can tell it’s a very conflicting flow of ideas that keep me confused and in the border of being “I might be ok” and “fuck it, I’ll cut the story short and slit my arms tonight”  so yeah.....I just wanted to share that.

Do you guys have similar thoughts? 
Just thought I might share it....idk

"dunnolike everyone else here, I really, really want to die. I've felt this way for years and years and have never gotten to the point of attempt bc I am a pussy and am afraid of failing like I do in literally every other aspect of life. I also can't bare to think of my death negatively affecting others' lives. logically, I know that it will. it would break my mom's heart, as well as deeply sadden my siblings. people that I have been friends with in the past will likely be sad, though I do believe it would be mostly for selfish reasons. what it all boils down to, though, is that I am so extremely unhappy with myself and I don't think I can change. Im fat and ugly and gross and I don't have the energy or motivation to improve it. im not good at anything and, again, can't muster up the energy to hone new skills or anything. all I do is sleep and eat and go to work because I absolutely have to. I don't have any close friends or relationships at all, even with family, because there's nothing about me that makes anyone want to be a part of my life. I don't blame them, but it hurts so, so badly anyway. Ive tried therapy and all of the therapists I've talked to don't take me seriously/I can't be honest about how absolutely, desperately sad and alone I feel. i can't finish my degree, I can't even sign up for classes because I can't meet deadlines to enroll or pay for them, don't have the money to pay for them anyway and don't ha e good enough credit for loans. even my cat likes my roommates more than me. I'm a sad, disgusting, ugly horrible excuse for a person and I don't deserve to be alive, nor do I want to me. I don't want to let anyone down by not showing up for work, and I don't want people to take the time out of their lives to look for me or mour  my absesense, but I want to run away and kill myself somewhete.remote so, so badly. I want to do it tomorrow after work, but I probably won't muster up the courage. instead, I'll go home, lay in my filthy room, drink  and pathetically salk my exes social medias &amp; cry until I fall asleep and have to start all over. 

all I want is to enjoy things again. I want to be clean and organized. I want to play guitar and write music and poetry and sing bad covers of songs I like. I want to learn things and be intelligent and remember the information I've learned so I can twll others about it. I want todraw and paint and be creative and create things that make me proud. I want to be able to talk to people about things we both enjoy and form connections and be a good friend and have people that love and care for me. it's all I've ever wanted, and I want it so badly, but I just can't do it and I don't know why.

"A personal ultimatumEven though I’m on 100mg of Serotonin right now, I still have these pervasive thoughts. I thought when I decided to change four years ago, that everything would be better eventually moving forward. However, nothing has changed.

I live an empty, meaningless life and every time I want it to change I get the worst tightening in my chest that keeps me glued in my fucking misery. 

The thought of release, to fully give up and sink away into nothing is just so *tempting*. I fantasize about all the ways in which I could do it.

"I think my girlfriend's father is forcing her to leave me I'm afraid that my girlfriend(14) will leave me(m, just turned 17) because her father is against the relationship.

Whenever I'm with her I feel butterflies and when she smiles at me the world stands still, she makes me feel like the happiest guy alive and I genuinely care for her and don't want her to get hurt in any way, in case you're wondering she has told me that she feels the same way about me.

We were texting eachother when she pretty much disappeared for half a hour, when she came back she sent a snap of her hand bandaged up, she has had self harm issues before, just like me, a month or so earlier we swore to each other that we won't do it anymore for each other. I asked her what happened and she told me a bit unbelievable story.

Then she asked me when she wanted me to lose my virginity, to which I replied ""whenever you feel ready, making you do something you're not comfortable with is the last thing I want to do"". She then asked ""what if I won't be ready?"", I replied ""you'll know when you're ready"".

Then out of nowhere she texted me ""I know that would be a reason for you to leave me"", I replied that I would never leave her. She started telling me that she wouldn't fulfill my needs and I would need someone else. I told her that all I would ever want is just to be with her and that having sex is not the point of the relationship.",0

"I want to tell you a story.When I was 20 I tried to kill myself.

I was in love, and she left. When she left, I left. Started fighting. Wanted to bleed. Started drinking. Eventually after months of drugs and,  and, I dont even know what... I gave up. 

I was at home, visiting my parents home. They were at work. I was mad. It was finally the day. I walked to the driveway and covered myself with gasoline, sat down and sparked my zippo. Fucking nothing happened. I was so fucking pissed. I tried a hundred times. By the time I finally gave up I was sobbing. I called my dad. I told him that I needed help. He said he was in a meeting. I knew then that no one would help me. I had to help myself. I took a shower, then I went to the doctor. 
He gave me some pills I never took (no judgement on medication often it is the right answer) and I got a referral to a Therapist.

I cannot overstate the importance of therapy. I was still suicidal for years. Even today I smoke. 

Everyday you must find a new reason to live. I Promise you, there is always a reason. One day it was a tree, with pretty flowers on it. I am happy that I got to see it. Seriously this motherfucker was MADE of flowers. The whole fucking tree! One day I saved a hummingbird. Broken wing stuck in a crack on the sidewalk. I found it. It flew away a week later. One day I had shared a six pack with a homeless guy. One day I called 911 after a car accident. There is always a reason. The trick is getting out of bed and looking for it. 

I am a survivor, and one day you will be too. 

P.S 

I will always respond to PMs.

All I wanted was life. Ten years of destroying my existence. And all I wanted was life. All I wanted was what everyone else has. I wanted to create a place for people to better themselves. And what do I get in return people who pretend to be my friend. People who drain me of everything and I don’t mean money but that too. They drain the nature meaning and love and all of it. What was the reason. Why did you people ruin my life. I could’ve at least had a decent life if not actually have achieved my goals of helping others. What was the reason. Or maybe there is no reason besides they didn’t like me. Maybe my life was ruined because I wasn’t cool enough. I never have anything. I don’t care about the money. I care about people and that most significantly has been taken from me.  I could’ve had some sort of decent life. I never hurt anyone I never did anything really wrong. I’ve just been a victim pretty much. Ten years of gaslighting three years of psychological torture one year of unrelenting mental anguish from others.

"Looking to talk this out. Not really set one way or the other. I don't know how to pick myself up. I don't know how to get going in the right direction. I've been unemployed since May. I've been out of college (graduated with a Bachelor's Degree) since December of 2010. I have two-hundred dollars to my name. I have no friends. No social skills. My day-to-day existence is comprised of waking up at three in the afternoon in my basement and sitting on the computer looking hopelessly at the day's job listings online here in the area and in the neighboring towns. 

Last night I deleted my social networking accounts because I'm only ""friends"" with people who I consider two-faced and spiteful. And because in some way I only use those accounts to get a small measure of validation from said people I don't even like. 

I end up disliking everyone I meet. All my personal projects--aspirations like writing and job hunting--are more consistently defeating than rewarding and contribute to this cycle of self-punishment and self-loathing. 

I feel very much alone. And I'm desperate for my life to change. I'm desperate to catch a break and I'm desperate to be happy. But I don't look forward to the next day and I find myself wishing I could just be asleep, even when I'm not involved in any especially taxing activity. Three nights ago I began contemplating suicide. Up to that point I'd always considered it a ridiculous thing, something that only happened in movies or in the news. But in the midst of feeling hopeless and weak I see in myself the inability to grow, to stand up and fight. And I don't see how this will ever change. I can't get traction with a career, with people, with myself. And I don't feel like I ever will. Because I'm so desperate for that to change but it seems like that desperation, that hunger to do something, isn't making my life any easier. It's not getting me closer to my goals and it's not getting me anywhere. 

I am a twenty-five year old man who's not happy to be alive. I'm soon to be homeless, totally friendless, and nothing is looking up. I'm not a productive adult, I don't have anything to contribute, I can barely get up in the morning. In fact, I just plainly don't want to.

"It feels like I'm constantly trying to escape.Being suicidal is very hard. I didn't know it would be this hard, and I don't know and don't believe there is truly an end except death.

What I've been contemplating about lately is, after dealing with the urge to sleep for good for this long now, is that ultimately what I go through being suicidal is a constant attempt to escape the present moment, or a constant wanting of this ""escape.""

This escape-desire is very uncomfortable. It engulfs me, and few understand. Other people have things to look forward to, while I do not. Everything I want is impossible, and that's basically why this constant escape I keep doing to leave behind the pain is exhausting. Being suicidal is like you are constantly running, running so long I can run mental marathons over and over, but after a while, you just stop, and dysfunction sets in. It's extremely difficult wanting to do and being forced to live due to love of your family. It's a trap, and it's painful. You can't say it's objectively good or bad, but all I know is that is hurts like hell. 

The main problem is that asking, seeking, and knocking, to God, or to the eternal, never gives me an answer that satiates this escape. The desire to escape is never satiated, pacified, cured, or ended by this ""entity"" out there. It's always something that barely, just barely, gets you by, while others have an abundance I never dreamed of. I don't understand this, but perhaps it is due to the momentum and the place you fall. I have fallen into a bottomless pit, and climbing up to the surface is what characterizes my struggles every day, for years upon years now.

But the bottom line is there never seems to be, or there simply isn't, anything that can quench the flames within me, it's always a need, and never a want, it's never a dream, but only harsh reality. 

The answer I receive is always a push, and never a pull.

Always uphill, and never downhill.

While others have their desires fulfilled by merely moving towards them, I have to break through a brick wall to attain just a scrap of what will get me by.

This is how it feels to be suicidal, and I wonder if others can relate.",1

"Your typical teenage breakup.I dated my last girlfriend for 2 years. We had our rough times but overall we were fucking perfect for each other. I met her in gym class my senior year, she was extremely shy, extremely fit and extremely cute. After a couple weeks of dming her I finally got her to a point where she had a crush on me. We went to my senior prom, one of my most fond memories in my entire life. We went to her senior prom. She pulled me out of the building early to play the first song we ever kissed to, and we slow danced under the stars. She was so romantic and so thoughtful. She would visit me nearly every day at the grocery store I work at. She was just by definition perfect. I was her literal everything. Because she was shy she didn't have many friends, didn't have many hobbies besides reading and hanging out with me. I loved the attention she gave me, she made me feel important. 4 months ago we took a break because I said something extremely rude to her and I don't know what came over me to say it. The break lasted 4 days, and she was scared that during the break I was going to think ""I'm free!"" and never look back. After our break we were the strongest we've ever been (at least that's what I thought). We expressed our love with kisses and cuddles and being inseparable every single day. We even took a few vacations just us 2 teenagers. Things were perfect. 6 days ago I was feeling rather glum, we hadn't had sex in awhile and she was dodging the question every time I asked her to move in. (she originally would say how she couldn't wait to marry me and move in with me). She asks me what's wrong and I tell her. No text back for the rest of the night. The next morning she says we need to talk. The talk involved her saying how she had been losing her spark with me and things never felt the same to her since our first break. She said she wanted to be single for awhile, she said she was always so caught up with me that she never could focus on herself and figure out who she is. We break up that day. While she's driving away she texts me saying ""I will love you forever."" Today I went and talked to her. I started out by trying to win her back, saying we could work things out and how much I still love her. She says she still wants to be single for awhile, and how it wouldn't be fair for her or me to be in a relationship that she's not emotionally attached to. I asked her if she thinks we could make things work down the road and she says ""if we're meant to be we will end up together."" I lost her guys. The girl of my dreams, literal perfection. Gone. I haven't eaten or slept in over 40 hours and while my mom is at the beach I'm contemplating driving into the garage, turning my car on and just falling asleep. I feel so fucking lonely and useless and all I can think about is her.",1
"I've been wanting to commit suicide forever, and need some help on letting myself not too...I've struggled with clinical depression, OCD, ADHD, and severe anxiety issues since I was a child. 

Basically, my parents are Indian, and I am just a white washed kid who has tons of mental health issues. 
I don't really want to type out my whole life story here however, here's a bit from my written suicide letters to my parents: 

"" You guys ridicule me for everything even depression, or something like ADHD. 
OCD for sure can be used as an example,considering so many members of our family have it, yet you fail to believe so. Or the simple fact that you guys fail to see any wrong in our family, and the fact that any mental issue should be shamed and is faked (or in mom’s perspective, not be linked to her side of the family). 
The smallest details can drive me to insanity due to my OCD, even my psychologist told you guys how severe it is. I can't do anything the correct way I want to. Everything is wrong and not the way I want it to be and it drives me mad and causes me to have mental breakdowns. 
My ADHD symptoms lead me to not concentrate in class. My mind wanders constantly, and though I may be interested in the subject my mind leads me to another path and I hate it. 
Then there's my depression, which tells me everyday that all of this can be stopped if I just die. No tomorrow means none of this. No more breakdowns. No more anything. It makes it seem right, in which makes me wonder, maybe it is…

Making fun of the fact that I have a mental illness is never good, joking saying “your whole body is fine, except for your brain”. Remarks like that have a toll like no other. If any organ in the body can have a problem, so can the brain, and that’s not a silly saying, it's reality. If we can't make diabetes go away, how would depression work? 
I mean in reality you can’t ridicule me when you feel there are bad spirits in the house and that's why I'm depressed and not smart, and that smoke from sage can make them go away, cause in the grand scheme of things, a lot of your obsessive beliefs are just as ridiculous as mine. However, if I say anything, I will more than likely cause a conflict, causing you to get more angry at me.""

That's just a small glimpse of things, however my parents are major helicopter parents, and also narcissists and if I say anything they will yell back at me, and say rude things, and also make me go down a deeper hole.

Now our story gets interesting Homecoming night in September , I left mad at my dad due to him telling me that I was an idiot for going on a date and that I shouldn't date or talk with girls and focus on friends till I get a job and after college, I had a night full of drama (since my date started acting awkward and weird), and by 10o’clock I was in tears because my life has never gone the way I had desired. 
For some, people saw me as the guy who won homecoming royalty, however inside I’ve been broken forever. 
Now, solving your problems with alcohol isn’t a proper solution, however I really needed a release that wasn’t death. I only ever even touched alcohol since I was in pain all that’s gone on in my life, and homecoming was where it all went down. 

I lied once I was caught, and said I was forced to take it at school by students, causing the school to get involved. Luckily I was honest and came to my senses at the meeting with the dean, however since then my parents have locked me down 100% and I'm lost on what to do. 
I haven't been able to hang out with a friend since then, anything I do has to be closely monitored, and I just got my phone back so they can track my location 24/7.

I'm a failure in their eyes. I'm a Junior who went from a 4.0 to a 2.8 GPA, and my SAT is in a couple weeks, and if I don't get a good grade on that then my dad says he will disappointed. 

I mean on the other side of things I do have a website where I share my music related stuff since I am a DJ and I really also want to help people create websites easily, just I know that won't kick off most likely, and my parents don't see any value for something rediculous like that. 
I lied saying that I coded it, but really used a CMS, with minimal code, and just added a ton of effort to make things look good.

I am failure in my own eyes, and I'm losing it by the minute.

I don't know what to do.

"In between choosing life or death.Hi guys, I'll try to keep this short and simple.

I'm constantly struggling wether to choose to feel sad, anxious, lonely and hopeless or strong and positive.

Sometimes I'm strong enough to choose life but most of the time I'm not, and once I choose to feel down it just goes in a downward spiral that is really hard to run out of.

I need to remind myself to be strong but it's hard, it really is. But I **need** to remember. I don't feel like my time to go is just yet, even when I want to. So that's why I need to help myself to chose life... And it's hard...

Sometimes I caught myself staring at a knife wondering how I would use it to kill myself and in those moments I have two options to either go for it by inertia or shake the thought off. I need to be able to choose the latter but sometimes it's _so hard_. My thoughts take complete control over me like if I was possessed by something and I'm no longer here.

Anyways, I don't know if this is the right sub to post this but I need to keep this straight in my mind. I *need* to live.",1

"I’m fucking tired. Really fucking tired.Here’s another sob story but fuck it who fucking cares at this point. No one

*Beginning*

Given up by a mother that doesn’t want me and a father who left only to be given to narcissistic parents who shove religion down my throat. Scared to death that anything I did wrong would make them give me up too. Just the the foster homes that sent me away. I lied. About everything. My understanding was “they’ll disown me and not give a fuck about me anyway. I have to lie to stay” and the beginning of the end started from age 8. 

I hated myself for lying and I was given punishments of screams, being belted down to a chair for hours, put into a corner whilst my 6’8” heavy drinker father pointed his finger into my face and screamed at me with the redness of a drunkard and stench of the liquor that he claimed as his water {living source} on his hot angry breath. My mother comparing me to my few good friends which twisted my mind into hating anyone who classified as a human being. Their right of freedom of speech became the freedom and right of cruelty. The few friends I had became my enemies quickly because of my hatred towards them. Loner and freak were now used more than own my name.

Nine. Age nine. The first time I had self harmed myself. All I knew was that it took away the hurt inside. The burning yet freezing. Polarizing hurt and anger from inside became too much so I hurt myself physically to take my mind off of it. Here we go again. Lies. I lied about what happened. My",1
"I've been there, and I can help. I was extremely suicidal for two years up until a few months ago. In that time-span, I have made 22 suicide attempts, 9 near-successful, the rest interrupted. If you need help, or have questions, please PM me or comment for a group discussion.

I hardly have time to sleep, I work 14 hours a day. I just need somebody to get me $300 so I can pay my bills. I don't know what to do now, I'm on the verge of suicide.

I need $300. It should be enough to cover the bills for now.

"In the end, all I really want is...Having been in and out of depression for the last 5 years of my life, I have come to accept the fact that I am depressed. However, this does not bug me anymore. I have gotten to the point where I see death as the light at the end of the tunnel. Death, to me, is the ultimate freedom; freedom from this world. I see death as a beautiful thing.

In the end, I do not want people to feel sorry for me, I don't want people to miss me. I do not want people to tell me that I am going to hell for this, or that I should just give it some time. I have given it a lot of thought already, and I see the end as the ultimate peace. 

In the end, all I want is the people closest around me to understand that I AM going to kill myself, and to accept it. I just want to them to say, ""I don't know what comes after death, but I wish you luck in the next life, if there is one. I will miss you, but I am glad you will finally become free."" 

Hearing those words, and then becoming completely free of this world, would be the best thing that could happen. 


At least, in my point of view.

"Life seems dark nowTo start off i am currently 18 years old and i have been trough so much physical,verbal and mental abuse.Since i was born i would get beaten for anything wrong i did by my father untill i got old enough to be able to fight back.my father has ruined my family by beating me,my siblings and my mom and cheating on her multiple times.
I was always a good student and I still am im currently in my 3rd year of highschool and i just cant handle life anymore i dont feel happiness unless im drunk or on drugs.and i have been drinking since age 15 weed since 16 and harder drugs(not too often tho) since late 17.i dont feel like i can talk to anyone so this is why im writing here.i really needed a place to vent i just feel like ending it all would be such a relief but also cause i dont believe in god or an afterlife death is as scary as living.i feel so bad cause living is torture and death scares me.Only thing that ever made me happy was love and the girl i loved cheated on me after a long time being together so it has left me scarred and besides that drugs and alcohol seem to help but i always feel kinda guilty afterwards cause i feel like im not normal and that im an outcast cause of years of abuse and bullying lead me to this place where i replace genuine feelings with substances.sorry about any grammar mistakes english isnt my native language.",1

"Trans. I want to get high tonight and then finally kill myself.I'm a 17 year old trans guy, so transitioning to male. I've always had a lot of issues with friendships, and I've always felt lonely because of it. Even in elementary school, I struggled. I only had 3 years of high school because the summer before my would-be senior year, I graduated early. Any friends I had pretty much vanished at that point. I came out to my parents that summer, and they resent me for it. I started on testosterone about a month ago and that's great, but that only helps with the physical gender-related issues.

I just feel lonely. I don't have friends. And when I say that, I mean no one. I mean, I have a few online friends I talk to sometimes, but that's it. I want to hang out with people. I'd been talking to this really cute, amazing guy for about a month and a half now and I fell really hard. I just get so much hate from my parents and our society in general that when someone showed romantic interest in me I latched on. We hung out once about two weeks ago and it was really, really nice but we haven't hung out since and it seems like he's losing interest in me. He's too nice to say so, but I can tell. I'm really good at reading people. Its my fault, too. I'm obnoxious, and he's gay and I hardly look/sound like a guy. I keep asking him to hang out because I just crave being around someone who doesn't dislike me, and it ruined it.

So now I feel more alone than before, and I feel hopeless. I texted him earlier asking if he wanted to come over and smoke tonight, but he hasn't responded and I'm telling myself he's just sleeping. He works like 4/5 AM - 11/1, so he sleeps during the day a lot. I don't expect him to come, or even reply to the text. But if he doesn't come, I want to kill myself tonight.

Now, obviously I'm not going to tell him that. That'd be manipulative and awful of me. But I need someone with me tonight and I don't have anyone else.

Its not his fault, either. I've felt like this for a long time, but seeing him drift away like that made me realize how shit I am. I don't see how anyone could love, or even like me. I'm trans, I've got a shit personality, I'm bipolar... I just feel hopeless.

So, plan is to get high as fuck tonight with the weed I bought today, and take my stash of pills. I've been saving up leftover SSRIs/SNRIs for about a year now whenever I switched dosages/meds. Parents are out of town until tomorrow so I have plenty of time to die. I just wish I didn't always fuck everything up.

Edit: Changed up my mix. Got a handful of aspirin, handful of benadryl, a good mix of celexa, Zoloft, pristiq, Prozac, hand full of motion sickness medicine and some nyquil. ",1
Shit might actually be looking up but there’s something I feel that’s missingHey y’all I just got some good news so I work in a manufacturing shop in school and I just got a table at my height so I can weld safely in my wheelchair and I’ve been really depressed still wanting to end it because of a few things. First off I’m a jealous asshole second I’m in a fucking wheelchair for life and I can’t seem to get a girlfriend like any of my classmates in all of my classes. Even the retarded kid had one for a while like seriously I basically have no friends and no one really care about me,1
"Why shouldn't I?Honestly its not like life even matters at this point, none of my friends would care and my family would get over it pretty quickly anyways. Besides even if those weren't factors life ends at all points anyways and you'll be forgotten soon enough so I might as well do it now.

"My life is great, I'm just not interested in itI am an eighteen year old attractive boy who graduated early from high school and is now going to community college. My home life is great. My parents got together at a young age and started an adventure company together so from a young age I was living the life; playing outside everyday either rock climbing, boating, or back packing. My mother is from Sweden, so just about every other year I travel abroad and visit my family in Europe. I am Intelligent; I get a's in all of my classes with little or no effort, and I learn things five times faster than everyone around me, and I am currently fluent in three languages and four instruments. My future is bright; I have three different jobs currently lined up that I'm interested in (one of which is in Sweden). the only bad things that have happened to me are that my sister killed herself four years ago (at the age that I am now), but I didn't really care, and I was chronically ill for five years in my youth, but that didn't bother me that much either. 

My point is that I shouldn't want to die, I should love life, but I don't. I hate the fact that all we really have is the moment and our memories of the past. That all that we're going to have before we die is a ton of memories and then we're gone. the only thing that I really want is absolute peace, to loose all consciousness and not have to think about anything or do anything ever again. I just don't want life.

This isn't something that I want to happen right now, but I'm sure its going to happen in the next three years

P.S. My psychologist says that I'm basically a psychopath with reduced empathy, but otherwise I'm completely normal. I think that I'm a very kind person; I volunteer every other weekend at the church, I give to my friends whenever they need something, and I try to be as selfless as possible 

Can you tell me why I should live?",1

I’m having so much trouble not doing something stupid tonight, because my husband and I are in a fight and so all the self worth I base around him is missing.",1

"Hi igI made a throwaway account to say this but I just feel lonely and bored of living. I've been in relationships but I never cared when they left. My dad died and I felt no empathy. My mom is probably gonna join him soon from how sick she's getting. I stopped caring about my paintings and music. I just play video games and binge watch anime but I feel so bored with being on this planet. I that there is an afterlife and I hope I get lucky. If I post again then I probably was too much of a weakling to do it.

I think that we should get to choose when we want to die if we get the chance and yeah I could get therapy but with how the health care system works then I'll probably be in debt and want to die even more.

Welp if anyone wants we can do a double suicide bye...",1
"funny how one can be so numb to the world yet so hurt by everything at the same timei’m honestly slowly starting to lose faith at this point. i keep trying to set tiny goals for myself so i could feel even a little bit accomplished. it’s always things like oh, i’ll try to keep up with my skin routine so i’m not so upset with how my skin looks, or maybe i will try to improve at something so i don’t feel so worthless or i will just simply try not to be sad today, i’ll try to not be so moody today and things like that, but it barely ever works. i mostly end up trying for a little while then i fall down that endless pit i dug for myself throughout all the time i’ve felt like this and i stop doing everything and anything. i genuinely don’t know any human being that is as worthless and useless as i am. not good at absolutely anything including socializing. no friends except the two people i speak to online. i don’t go out. it’s really just kind of pathetic how i don’t have a single thing i could hold on to. wholeheartedly not sure why i’m still here. not sure why i feel like anyone would miss me if i disappeared. just wish people never knew me so i could vanish without worrying about anything. i don’t like living like this. feeling like i’m a burden to everyone and not having a hobby that i’m even decent at. maybe i just don’t know how to try. and i keep telling myself i’m used to feeling like this because it has been this way for years but that’s just because i’m too scared to admit how hurt i am. this never-ending feeling got me at such a young age and i couldn’t hate it more than i already do. i’m so scared of where it’s all leading to but i’m way too big of a coward to try and end it. hope i’m not so lonely and hurt next year. or maybe the one after it. we’ll see as long as i am still alive.",1
"I’m going to kill myself tonightThis has come 18 years too late but I’ve finally committed to doing it. I’ve written my farewells to the few people in my life and I’m just waiting to send them. I’m hoping my balcony is high up enough but even if it’s not, this just needs to be done. I’ll probably try to run away from it like I do everything else but I just need to do something good for everybody in my life just this one time

I’m such an anomaly in life and I should’ve had this happen a long time ago. I’m sick of putting this off but now that I’ve truly reached the end of the road, it’s time for some course correction. I have no ways forward in life and no hopes to be crushed, this has really just been my only path in life and I just need to own up to my life and walk it

I don’t even really know why I’m making this post. Maybe I want some extra encouragement to push me over the ledge. Maybe I need to lock this in to myself so I actually do it. Maybe I’m just a piece of shit who wants to spread my suffering to more people. I don’t know, I just need this to end",1

"My friend tried to kill herself last nightI just don't know what to do, or what I should expect. I didn't follow the ambulance to the hospital because her family and one of her long-time friends were going to be there with her. I've only known her for a few months so I wasn't sure if I she would want me there and I didn't want to impose. I contacted her aunt,  who said she wasn't allowed to see anyone,  and that she would keep me updated. I assume that means she can't use her phone or anything either,  so I haven't tried contacting her because I don't know who is holding on to her phone at the moment. I don't really have anyone else to talk to because some of my friends are understanding,  but don't have experience with a situation like this/don't know her,  while the others don't really like her/seem not to care very much. My family hasn't had much to say on the matter either. I'm just really worried and waiting for her aunt to contact me is tearing me up inside. I guess I'm wondering how long the hospital will keep her,  and what to expect if I am able to go see her. Sorry if this is in the wrong subreddit, I'm not sure where to post it",1

"Sensorimotor OCD and suicideSince August of last year, I've been obsessed with the physical sensation of breathing. This initially came from an immense cannabis-triggered anxiety attack, which then latched onto how short of breath I felt in those days.

Like any other affliction, it seems to fluctuate from being tolerable most days, to being something that makes me have multiple panic attacks on a daily basis. Hyperventilation and this naturally go hand in hand, since because I'm unwillingly focused on every breath I take, I end up getting more oxygen in than my body really needs.

My life doesn't have a lot going for it right now, even though compared to last year, I'm probably over the moon. I have a job after being unemployed for more than a year (even though I hate work with a passion, regardless of whatever job it is), and am in the first romantic relationship I've ever been in in my life.

Regardless of all of these positives, this breathing obsession ebbs and flows to the point where the past three quarters of a year have felt like a long-winded dark night of the soul. If things get worse again, I feel as though I want to fade to black, for good.

I'll miss my partner, I love him to pieces. I'll miss the few friends that call once in a blue moon, but I just don't know if I can live with this anymore. I've tried half a dozen antidepressants, I've tried eating better, I've tried exercising, I've gone to therapy and practiced CBT, and nothing's worked.

I don't know what to do anymore. I don't want to hurt my partner, but I don't know how much longer I can go on living like this. It's alienating, it's hard as hell to talk to anyone at all about this, because I know nobody who's ever dealt with this. It's maddening. I feel my sanity on the verge of snapping. I can't deal with it anymore.",1

"Brother, mom and best friend have all diedHi, I’ve never posted before so here goes. I had a mental breakdown 9 years ago shortly after my dog, a perfect companion, died. Then I lost my job, and due to the job loss, lost my home as well and was forced to move thousands of miles from my “friends.” As time passed, I’ve felt like, for the most part, I’ve been forgotten. 
Now everything that kept me going is gone. My dad is dead, brother died from cancer 5 years ago, my mom died last March and the only friend I still had died of a heart attack completely out of the blue 4 weeks ago. Our last conversation was awful, she said some terrible things to me, and I’m still trying to understand why. I don’t know if she wasn’t feeling well and took it out on me? 
Now I’ll never get the chance to talk it over with her; she’s gone. I can’t get that last conversation out of my head and I want to forgive her, but I admit I sometimes still feel very angry with her. 

I’ve been suicidal for at least 10 years now and I feel this past year has just been the final straw. There’s just nothing left anymore. I have severe social anxiety so making new friends seems almost impossible. When I got the phone call that she had died, I did a test of trying suspension hanging. It scared me. I don’t want to fuck up. There are train tracks near my home and every night I listen to the train and fantasize about standing on the tracks just waiting to get obliterated. I don’t really feel like I know how to keep going or even why? It seems like a decade of nothing but pain and I have no faith that it will get better. I’ve been on meds and seeing therapists for years. 
I know there are many people much worse off, but I just can’t shake the feeling that there’s nothing left on earth for me. 
How does anyone keep going in a world where there so much pain and loneliness?",1

"bromhydrosisHi there, I also suffer this condition in my feet since the last  years. I visited over a dozen dermatologists and only one knew about this illness, she treatrd a couple of patients but couldn't cure anyone. She diagnosed me with 'pitted keratolysis', treated with fusidic acid during a month cures around 70% of patients. Also is recommended to use aluminium 20% antiperspirant, but this thing made things worse for me since my skin developed contact dermatitis.

Somehow I can manage the bad smell a couple of hours so I can go to work everyday. I take an oral antibiotic (Cefadroxil) and apply fusidic acid  or mupirocin. After that I apply an hypoallergenig antiperspirant (Lavilin) and I'm ready to go to work 5 or 6 hours with a bearable odour (the smell is still there but way less offensive).
At nights I apply urea40% in the feet, helps to kill some more bacteria. And is very important to wear only sandals, the cold and  oxygen make a hostile environment for  bacteria to develop(that's why the smell dissappears as soon as you take off your shoes).
I tried botox and worked for my hyperhidrosis, but the pestilence was still there.
Recently I heard about good guy bacteria neutralizing the bad smelly bacteria, try to google it as 'alive probiotic spray for the skin Ammonia-Oxidizing Bacteria' but I can't order it since they don't ship overseas.

I write a blog (is in Spanish, bromhidrosisblog.wordpress) and found that many people suffer this same hell, and also share suicide thoughs ... but please hold on a little, try to focus in other aspects of your life and try to improve yourself as much as you can while some genius discovers a cure to make us normal persons again.",1

"It's so weird...It's been a while since I've been thinking about suicide but these two past days have been different. I kind of feel better and yesterday I even went out for a walk with ""my"" dog (walking has always been one of my favorite activities but I hadn't done it since September, I just didn't feel motivated to do so even if I wanted to) and watched a movie (it had been a month since I last watched one and I'm very, very fond of movies). Doing these things made me veyr happy to be honest.

Anyway, I'd been thinking for a while about offing myself after Easter break, yet I don't feel the same about it right now but there is something in my head telling me that I have to do it and that it has always been how I should go. Honestly, when I think about my future there is nothing to look forward to. I've always felt and been alone. I hate myself for being so needy and for wanting someone to care about me. I don't know why my mood has radically changed this way but these thoughts sure as hell bother me endlessly. I mean, it's like I can't shake them off and even when I feel better they are there no matter what. I'm so fucked up like yesterday I watched videos of people committing suicide and one of them made me feel so sick I almost threw up. I know they will come back, it's always been like this since 2015. Sometimes I'm amazed at how much of a coward I am, even at my lowest.     

I don't know what I'm looking but is it normal to feel this way? to think about it even when I'm fine?  ",1
"I have psychosis and SAD and I can't stand winter anymore. I had a heartbreak today. I don't have any hope to live.I have taken a medicine course related to my psychosis and I don't hallucinate like that before but last two winters were unbearable. Even yesterday, my gf broke up because I caught her cheating and this is the third time I've been in love ans my partner cheated on me. Winter makes me sad and the thought of killing myself always comes to my mind. Even today I was thinking about all emptyness and betrayal. My GFs never had to face any of my mental problems nor have I ever abused them or been rude to them. I gave my best yet I'm not that charming or the alpha male type. Had Xanax a while ago but If I have to depend on medicine I guess I don't know what to do anymore. I'm a 5 ft 10 guy and a bit obese but girls don't like me. I don't have enough friends too.

"Life-lasting diagnosesFirst; It's exceedingly difficult to adequately express exact how I feel and every underlying thought. 

I have been diagnosed with two psychiatric conditions/syndromes that will be with me for the rest of my life. Due to privacy I will not say with ones, but it is not anxiety, depression or other conditions with a more ""temporary"" nature. Despite having several good trustworthy friends, family and living in a country where the costs of health care is an no-issue, I live a very amputated life compared with my cognitive potential. It is not the individual components that is ""killing"" me, but the sum of the whole. An ordinary person would not experience the same ""hang ups"" but in a higher degree accept the situation.

Everything in life is an uphill battle. You fail to achieve self-esteem and success through the same ""platforms"" like education, social success during childhood and young adult, a steady job, a relationship, other things. Disturbing thoughts about my role in society, the near constant feeling of that my life was never meant to be, unhealthy obsessions (unhealthy as in non-productive and ""odd"", not physical hazardous or illegal). Everyday symptoms are paranoid disillusions, depressive thoughts, emptiness, extreme emotions like hate, anger, fear, much more. It's like a ""hells week"" in the army, but it never ends, and it will happen again and again and innumerable times more. I think of *what could have been*. Only in extremely rare occasion do things go my way. I have tried so much. Medications, physical training, socialize, therapy..

I am sorry, but I do not see any other way.",1

if you wanna read my life story you can see that in /depression/ and i seriously don't see any point of why not to kill myself tonight. Yea a lot of people would care but I don't give a single fuck nobody understands what living like this is like. It doesn't end it never has and i'm pretty sure it never will. I don't wanna keep going ""one more day"" I've said that for 5 years. Everythings so fucking stupid.",1

"I thought my life is going in better direction. I was wrong.It all became worse, I was depressed since being 6 and till 21 my life was in a terrible abyss full of hate, depression and disappointment. I tried to contact psychologists and therapists, still taking medicaments till this day, and my life became a little better for like a half year. I had a job, I've began feeling better and this fake hope that depression will finally be over came to my mind, but after this half year my life collapsed into worse state. 

I'm 22 old right now, still living with parents and wasting all time playing games or doing garbage-grade art as I have nothing to do. I've been praying to god to die, just to end up as a non-believer. Those suicidal thoughts ceased between being 21 and 22, but now it all returned as suicide became the only thing that makes sense in my life now. I hate that, but I realised it. 

My family is disgused with me and my depression, while my mother who has an obvious borderline syndrome doesn't care about my depression and entirerly blames video games, just by saing something like ""You're just sad because you failed in games. Go get a job."" And it sickens me. My father... who I hate calling this retard like that, is enraged that I'm not paying for HIS bills and found fun in harassing me at daily routine. There was not a day where I didn't heard a word of swear from this sexually obsessed narcisstic ape, I'm disgused by this piece of shit. ""Lick my anus"" ""fucking retard"" ""I have nothing from you"" are just few spits on my face from him, and he's successfuly placing my entire family, especially my mother against me. He brags at daily routine how useless I am for not paying for HIS bills. I'll call him by name, Thomas, because calling him my father makes me wish to never be born. I tried to speak with my family about my problem, but not only they don't care, they became to hate me more.

I've never had a real friends. For my entire life, I was either alone, or alone and bullied. Since I was 6 till 14 the only people that were giving me attention were bullies making fun of me for being depressed and lonely. Then all my classmates were not giving a fuck about my existence, and my current 4 friends (to which group I was invited by one of my classmates, most likely because he felt sorry for me) are toxic as hell, especially to people online, and they try to convice me to be as toxic as they are. No matter how terrible my days are, I cannot expect any support from them.

My therapist and psychologist doesn't seem to care. My visits are never longer than 5 min, and they repeat the same stuff over and over again. Psychologist only gives me a receipt for antidepressant drugs, which are no longer working and I cannot afford them anymore, while therapist always asks me about getting a job even when I'm feeling like a garbage who's tired entire days.

I don't know how long I can keep carrying on, how long I can lie to myself that life will be better, that I can improve, that my dreams can be true, that suicide is not a salvation. I'm exhausted emotionally and physicaly, for my entire life I've absolutelly never woke up in the morning well rested, and my mind all time shifts between being absolutely numb or being a chaotic mess where I cannot think rationally. I feel done, and father only pushes me into suicide more, because it seems like that's fun for him to harass people in need.

I'm done.",1
I think I'm almost ready to commit suicideWith each passing day I feel myself growing stronger. The fear isn't as strong as it used to be. I don't whether I want help anymore.

"I really want to kill myself but I can'tI've been feeling really emotionally unstable for the past few weeks, I've been binge drinking for one and my ex dumped me.

I also feel really isolated from my family due to their own arguments and my religious beliefs not being as strong. I really want to kill myself, I feel out of my own body and I feel like an object when I look in the mirror, like I don't have free will or something to kill myself.

"My family makes me suicidal. I'm so tired of being told I'm a worthless piece of shit and that I never do anything or help and that I should shut up when I express an opinion or ask a question or ever say anything. I'm so confused on how my mom is sometimes nice and comforting when I'm really obviously overloaded with her and my sister's insults, but as soon as she's satisfied that I can take more she gets right back on the job of making me feel like I should've never been born. She tells me all the time, very specifically, that she hates the way I look and my personality and she's ashamed of me. She doesn't let any of her friends see me, one time I went to the grocery store she works at and she kicked me out, met me outside later and yelled at me for coming inside in the first place because her co worker/friends could see me. I'm not gross looking, either. I look like a normal person, I act like a normal person, but I can't take all this abuse. I just want to slit my arms or something. I am a cutter, though it's been a while since I've last done it, but tonight, without anything being said, my mom started ranting to the air about how I'm a shit daughter and she wishes she never had me. Well, I really fucking wish she never had me too. Everything is really messed up. I don't want to be here, it isn't worth it. Last year I found out a few things, since I was in foster care for a bit when I was a teenager, and I was molested for most of my childhood.. I found out that even though I'm diagnosed with depression and stuff, I'm really a normal person. I'm just surrounded by assholes who don't give a shit. It's my mom's fault that I was sexually abused, it's absolutely her fault I was taken away, and it's her fault that I'm here tonight wanting to go to my room and die. I can't take it anymore. I'm so fucking ALONE with all this shit. I can't say a word about the sexual abuse because I actually get fucking yelled at because my mom doesn't want to hear it, she's basically like fuck off and get over it. And I can't. I just want to fucking die. Maybe I'll go see my abuser and get some peace because I sure as hell won't get any here. ",1

"Chronic pain for over a year is destroying meEvery since June of 2015 I have had chronic urinary tract / urethral pain. I've been to multiple specialists and have taken so many different medications, changed my lifestyle, and nothing works. Constantly looming over my head is the possibility that I have a truly uncurable and painful condition that's causing my symptoms, and the only way to get a true diagnosis is to go through a risky and painful cystoscopy. From what I've heard, the procedure is incredibly painful during and after, and can result in complications such as urethral stricture. So not only will the one diagnostic procedure that I can have will temporarily make my pain worse after, but it can have permanent complications. Urethral stricture is essentially incurable, and the only treatments involve painful dilation or invasive surgery (basically, everything involves shoving things things or cutting up the urethra, and they only act as treatments and not cures - ouch.) 

I'm truly caught between a rock and a hard place. I either live with my pain hoping it goes away, go through extremely painful diagnostic procedures that will make my pain worse, or undergo painful treatments. I'm only 20 years old, it feels so unfair that I have to go through this so young. Most people that get these procedures are much older.

Ejaculation hurts and urinating often burns. As a 20 year old, it's horrible to think that I won't be able to have a normal sex life that most people my age would have. Let's say I end up getting a urethral stricture - what happens then? I'll be constantly in pain whether or not I go through treatments. I've heard of people that have to live with this, and it sounds like a truly miserable and inefficiently documented condition. 

I can't even take antidepressants because they further complicate my urinary tract symptoms. Trust me, I would love to be on them.

I honestly don't know how much longer I can do this for. I don't want to hurt my friends and family, but this is becoming unbearable. Ever since March I have had anxiety attacks almost every day which are often accompanied by spells of crying. I'm always fatigued, and have lost my motivation and my former happy self. I'm not sure I'll be able to handle my upper level science courses this fall in my current state. Being with friends doesn't make me feel better anymore. Talking about it doesn't help because no one understands the pain I'm in and nothing anyone says will take the pain away. I don't want to hurt my loved ones by exiting, but I just don't know anymore.",1

"Being stuck in the house for over a month gave me a reason to do less than what I was doing before.I just feel like my life is going nowhere in the end. I just feel like the negativity from my mind and from others is just destroying me. I have not been as productive as I was before quarantine. I mean I hated myself before but now it's worse if that's even possible. I had a job even though I was messing up in every other area in my life. I still had a job that I liked. Don't get me wrong it wasn't a good job I wasn't getting paid a lot but it was something for me to do and I could see the people I worked with who I really liked. I could also get away from being in a living space with someone who doesn't like me. I just feel like dying is better, but I'm not gonna kill myself. I can't because I've tried a few times in high school and twice in college. Now every time I want to kill myself I just think about how I can't ever succeed in doing that because it's very difficult from the situation I'm in. I mean I have a plan but I can't pull it off. So here I am dreading being alive and being in a place where I feel unwanted. I can never seem to get my life together. I've screwed up so much, and I can't put myself on the right track. So I figured dying was the best way out because I can stop being annoying, I can finally stop depending on my mom, and the pain would go away. I am broke so I can't go and live by myself, my credit sucks because I screwed it up. I won't go into detail because I was just being lazy and stupid and depressed. I don't have a job right now and I'm expected to contribute in the place that I'm living in now even though I can't do much which I don't feel like elaborating on. I have zero confidence and I feel just like a failure. I am overweight and I have been eating less and less during quarantine because I feel uncomfortable eating in this place because like I said before the person I live with doesn't like me. This is not a cry for help, I can't be fixed. I know how screwed up I am. This is just me wanting to rant on reddit for like the fourth time since quarantine. Sorry this was so long I don't expect people to read it I just wanted to talk.

"Done with Life. I don't like doing anything. No goals, no interests, no hobbies. No noticeable cause for this, and its been ongoing for over 5 years. Therapy didn't help. Tried everything I could think of to fix those, and asked advice from at least 200 people. No one else to help me. I go to a job I don't like and I can't think of a single thing I'd actually want to do. No friends. No girlfriend. Emotionally quite sensitive, coupled with most people treating me like I don't exist, or using me, or losing interest after a short while. Great potential; I'm fairly intelligent, and anything mind/thinking based, I can easily pick up if I want to. I think it's worse that way, because I'm wasting it as there's nothing I want to do. I'd much rather be stupid and useless than potentially greatly useful. In all honesty, I don't think there's a single upside to my life. I'm considering not living it. All you need is a rope and something that can sustain your weight. Very easy, if selfish, solution. Then again, if anyone reads this, they'll probably think I'm emo or something. It doesn't really matter, it's difficult to understand unless you've spent 5 straight years caring for people that you come across, hoping that one will return the favour and be the person who wants to know you, who wants to make sure you feel happy. Mind you, I eventually gave up on caring for people. I just couldn't do it, knowing how people are. Seeing all those cold eyes. You probably have the same eyes...",1
"Wrote this suicide note for whenever I get the balls hopefully soonEveryday I just want to kill my self. No matter how many people I tell or what they say it doesn’t work. It just makes me want to shut down and not listen. Everyone says the same shit and I can tell they don’t mean it. I get no joy out of anything I do. Those rare moments of happiness I have are quickly followed by an immense sense of dread like I don’t want myself to be happy. I do so many pointless things just to please other. I know no one will accept me for my true self. Whenever I do feel happiness I go right back to feeling empty and annoying at existing. Everyday I think about shooting myself multiple times a day and it won’t stop no matter who I tell. Worst of all I only feel shame around my parents. They always want me to do something extra when I barely feel like doing anything at all. They always see me so annoyed and distant and they never make an effort to change their behavior. I find it nearly impossible to explain my true feelings to anyone and this just makes me feel more alone. I always feel like my parents look at me with shame and this frustrates me. I do not see the point in the extending my suffering any longer. I don’t give a fuck about their feelings because they never gave a fuck about mine. Whenever I did try to tell someone how I felt I just felt stupid for feeling this way. I beat myself up internally constantly so when other people are mean it hurts 100x worse especially those I love. I feel others constantly try to invalidate my feelings rather than truly address them. I’ve even started cutting and no one noticed. I’ve just wanted to end my life for the longest time.

I dont deserve to live i should have died by now i even promised to kill myself by january 2020 but i didnt and i got a grade 2/3 rare ass brain tumor . Ive been unemployed human trash since may 2019.

my life pretty much changed for the worst when my long-term boyfriend and i broke up two years ago. the relationship was very traumatic for me for a lot of reasons.   


i spent the relationship taking care of him and his situation, which i do not regret - but i compartmentalized all of the trauma that i received. i never took care of myself, and now its hitting me. 

&amp;#x200B;

i cant bond with others anymore. i used to have stupid useless sex constantly that made me feel like a piece of meat to be consumed. now intimacy terrifies me. 

  
closeness and hugs scare me. i'm extremely isolated and i only ever leave the house for my (extremely tough medical) school and to get food. debt is piling up because of that but its my only joy. 

i cant stand people getting close to me. i cant stand hanging out with friends. but yet i want love and intimacy so badly. i feel like im so broken, and that i'm never going to feel like a human again.

 i just feel like a vessel that serves as a stupid, servicing fleshlight to fuck. to only ever improve the quality of others - not me. i don't deserve it.

"I've been thinking about suicide a lotI think about it daily, I set at my desk at work and just think about how awesome it would be to not be in constant torment. 

I recently got divorced from a woman who put up with my depression and irritability until she couldn't anymore. Now I'm a 30 year old man going home to an apartment alone, with no one to share my life with. Such an odd feeling to know 2 months ago things where fine, great job, nice house, in school working on masters, rocky but semi stable relationship, and 2 amazing dogs...to now coming home to silence. 

The reason I haven't done it is for my parents and brother, the thought of their pain and dealing with me committing such an act stops me in my tracks, I could never do that to them. I hope that I stay committed to them. 

I text with my ex still, things are pretty cordial for the most part. However, she's already started looking for someone. I don't get that, how could you already be looking for a relationship?? I will not act all high and mighty because I have already slept with someone else, but I'm not even close to being ready for a relationship. How is this even reality?? People suck.

"Life is kicking my assI'll try to summarize where my life is at right now. In about 3 months time, I've fucked everything up and I'm at a place right now where for the first time in my life, I can't find anything to keep me afloat. 

First of all, I'm 29. In May this year, I lost my job, and I didn't find a new job immediately. I had some trips and festivals planned this summer, and since I got fired I had some security with an unemployment income. 

In June, I moved into a new apartment with a new roommate. This had been planned for a while. It cost me some money of course, and the apartment was a bit more expensive than the previous one. 

Over the summer, a long string of bad decisions lead to serious financial trouble. I started abusing my credit card, spending money I didn't have. Right now, my balance is at -3500 EU, and my bank called me up to announce that I have to clear this debt by September 15th. 

I cancelled an upcoming vacation, and furiously started looking for a job. It's been harder than I expected, and right now I don't have the time to get that money, so my breathing space is decreasing one day at a time. I've been trying to keep it together and build things up again constructively, but I've been suffering. 

I'd been investing a lot of time in this girl I met, and there was a real prospect of a relationship. Once I didn't decide to go on the vacation, she kind of kicked me when I was down and made things worse by throwing all kinds of insults and blames at me. Obviously, this is not the kind of person I need in my life so I broke this off instantly. 

Yesterday, my roommate announced after only 3 months that he doesn't want to live with me anymore because of this insecurity, which I don't blame him for. 

For the last month now I've been trying to stay positive. I stopped using drugs, stopped smoking, stopped smoking weed, recovered my rhythm, started working out again, dealt with all the shit that had been piling up for months, and I've been looking for a job intensively. 

Today though, I couldn't keep it together anymore. I'm usually a pretty positive person, and I've always enjoyed some uncertainty in my life as I was always able to see new opportunities in everything. 

For the first time now, I don't have any security and I can't seem to find anything that gives me the energy to continue. I know all of this has been my own fault, as I've been running away from my problems way too long. A lot of people whom I considered friends (the girl and the roommate to start with, but all the other friends I planned on going on the vacation with too) have been dropping me like I have some infectious disease. 

There is not a single aspect of my life that isn't shitty right now. My financial situation is dramatic, I'm out of options and time is running out. I don't know where I'm gonna live in a few months, or how I'm even gonna pay for it. The prospect of a relationship has all of a sudden disappeared, a lot of my ""friends"" are gone, the job hunt is giving me one disappointment after the other... And right now I just can't see a way out. 

My life is in the gutter, and any prospect I had is now gone. For a few weeks now, I've been fighting thoughts of suicide. But every time I worry about my situation, I end up with only one possible solution. Every time I come to that solution, it's becoming harder and harder to fight that thought. 

Today I broke down completely and just started crying my heart out, I even started writing a goodbye letter... It's not the first time I've had thoughts about suicide, the circumstances in my life right now have made those thoughts stronger than ever. My biggest problem is that I could never stand the pressure of the expectations that were put on me. I kind of 'ran away' from home years ago to get away from the pressure, but I've realized that my entire life has been an illusion. My true self has been completely overshadowed by this image of myself I projected onto the world, through which I pretended to be able to fulfill those expectations.

As a result, I've always struggled with a heavy identity crisis. I'm sick and tired of pretending to be someone I'm not, but the problem is that I don't know who I really am. I've been looking deep inside, only to find emptiness... I feel like my true self has died years ago, and I'm a ghost that's merely physically present in this body. 

I could always cope somewhat with this issue by looking for external distractions, by escaping reality. Through the circumstances of my life at the moment, reality has come crashing in, and I no longer have the energy to pretend. I'm down to my most humble self. 

I've lost all my will to fight, I'm down on my knees. I just need a fucking break already, but the bad news just keeps piling up. My back is against the wall, and I'm not sure how I'm gonna get out of this. 

I have a few true friends left who I can talk to about this, but I doubt they realize how bad I'm doing... I guess I just needed some place to vent and be honest about how bad my situation is right now.",1
"I’ve never hurt like thisi am a 14 year old girl who lost her dad last year to suicide. i won’t go into details but i made a choice, a choice to help decide which parent i would stay with back when he was alive. i choose my mother because i loved him but i was so numb and depressed to the point where i didn’t care what happened to me. long story short we got into a bad accident and i got 2nd degree frostbite and they asked me did i want to leave him and i said yes, a few months later he killed him self. i recently found some messages and i think, i think i made the wrong choice. i was the reason he killed himself, i could’ve stopped it. i don’t know how to live with myself, i can’t numb it. i killed someone, i don’t know how to go on.",1

Fuck it. I'm really sad right now and don't want to bother anyone IRL but have to get things of my chest. Sorry for rambling if you decide to read that (which I doubt) but I've never vented even on the Internet but it seems like I'm going crazy if I won't. Buckle up, this will gonna be a long text (sorry for my bad English btw., I'm German).
I don't jump to the conclusion that I'm actually depressed (clinically) but I guess there is something wrong with me.
I think my problem is in fact that I'm weak minded and egocentric and overall a shit person. I've got this feeling that (nearly) everybody else is dealing with similiar problems or more so feelings but knows how to keep them away and appreciate everything else. Nearly everybody would probably think I'm quite stable because I'm very restrained especially if I'm not home and as I said never share my feelings with anybody because I don't want to bother people with things that actually aren't real problems. Most people would probably say that I'm quite successful actually: Despite being really lazy and being hindered by my emotions and being really introverted I was one of the best of my year even though I'd say that I'm quite stupid. This trend continues in university as well. I'm studying biology at a well respected university and despite being dumber than probably everybody else I've got the luck to be in the top 5 percent of my year having an average of 1.4. Studying biology is a dream come true but despite the fact that I never even thought I'd achieve this and thinking it would finally make me feel less miserable and pathetic it just doesn't seem to fulfill me. Nearly everybody else seems to be as happy as can be because they have the privilege to learn all this cool stuff and are really enthusiastic whereas I experience this amazement and enthusiasm rarely. Because of this I feel like I don't deserve this privilege. Though I've only told this my best friend and as you could imagine he told me what I already knew: That everybody else is experiencing similiar doubts. The problem is: This doesn't reasure me. In fact I feel even more pathetic for feeling the way I do.
This maybe sounds like I try to be really 'manly' by not talking to anyone but that's not the case. (I think trying to be manly by doing 'manly stuff' is actually quite ridiculous and sad as it shows that one is just insecure and has a lack of personality. It's much more impressive to be yourself even if that means you enjoy something unusual)
It's just that I think I never learned to talk about my problems and thus I don't even know how to express what I feel like. Therefore I feel really uncomfortable to bother anyone with my problems and decided that nobody except my best friend is allowed to catch just a glimpse of my inner conflicts. There's one exception when I confessed most of my problems to a girl after she told me hers (which were arguably much more severe I would say but at least she was quite open about them) but because of misunderstandings (at first she loved me but I didn't love her but didn't notice/believe someone could love me, then I loved her, drugs, feelings of betrayal &gt;&gt;teenage drama I guess) we aren't nearly as close as we used to be and we/I am still recovering from that. But despite the fact that this story took quite a toll on me I didn't dare to tell anybody because I was ashamed of the whole situation, me confessing my problems to her and some actions of me. I just don't like to be remembered of my weaknesses and mistakes. For example I used to bully this one kid probably because of my inferiority complex and being bullied myself (but I'd say I deserved it in some way (pissed my pants in first week of middle school on a school trip in the woods because I was to scared to ask if I could go) and now I'm friends with both ones that used to bully me and the guy I bullied myself) and everytime this is brought up in a haha funny way I cringe so hard that it's hard for me to keep my calm and collected outside. 
Maybe some of my problems originate from my father and my familiy. He's clinically depressed as I recently found out and had to deal with a hell of a childhood though he never talks about that. His depression manifests in a lot of ways: He won't talk about problems which goes so far that he once disappeared and my mom had to call every hospital in our city to find out he was having surgery, won't admit any mistakes and blame everybody else, is really choleric in general and he isn't able to show love in the slightest so I crave for every bit of affection he shows me like a simple hug (There have been maybe 3 or 4 of them in my conscious part of life) while simultanously feeling relieved when I found out that he possibly has cancer. Well because of that I think I've got on the one hand a big thirst for appreciation and acknowledgment and on the other hand can't handle compliments or being honored (especially in front of an audience). This results in the paradox that I one the one hand kind of secretely brag about my accomplishments by mentioning them when someone asks me and it's appropriate but on the other hand I then 'act' (I don't know if you could say that's genuine humbleness but I'm genuinely ashamed) humble when someone is therefore impressed/interested/compliments me. 
Additionally I sometimes even lie about some accomplishments or make them seem more impressive then they are (for example I won a fellowship of the German association of chemics (GDCH) because I was the best in chemistry of my year and thus they would've supported me if I would have chosen to study chemistry but I tend to tell that I had a scholarship for chemistry)
 
I tend to lie a lot actually and I'm not really honest for which I despise myself. Often times I don't even know why I lied myself or I get myself into situations im which I have to lie. Often times I tell a false story if I don't know what to tell someone I'm alone with anymore and have to talk to. It's kind of a reflex as I fear this uncomfortable silence so I'll tell a dumb story or even if I know what to tell someone I'll change the story without any reason or exagerate something (dramatically).

As mentioned earlier I take drugs and I don't see anything wrong with that as I am far from being addicted (I only take something every 2-4 months(except maybe alcohol) nor do I crave any drugs though I enjoy them). But sometimes I dream about the 'golden shot' as it seems to be a rather enjoyable death but I never attempted suicide though I have and had some plans. I don't do much self harm except hitting myself (though as I got older and stronger this got more severe) as I started self harm while I was quite young and didn't really know about cutting and as I've seen really horrible scars I'm quite glad about that. 

I used to be quite a loner and for 4 years actually and talked with nobody outside of school or at least never met with someone. I think that contributes to my communication problem as well. Now that I've got friends I don't tell someone that I'm not in the mood to meet them (because I'm sad) but either meet them anyway or tell them I can't come for some elaborate reason. 

But recently it just seems that I'm not able to restrain myself anymore or at least it takes all my energy and it feels worse then ever. Just today I was invited to a party of my best friend but I don't even have the energy to tell him I won't come because there simply isn't any energy left for me to continue. I just can't come up with the lies and thus I'm paralyzed and just don't answer their texts. I'm so tired of myself and being this stupid. 

Something I wouldn't normally tell anyone without being forced: Even though I have more female then male friends and sometimes even cuddle with them, cook with them and even had 2 female friends fall in love with me... I still haven't had my first kiss. I don't know if that's because I'm quite ugly (maybe a 3/10; 5/10 being average) but I guess I somehow 'tricked' (I'm convinced and as I am a objectivly despicable person if someone would look through my mascerade that nobody would love my true self) at least 2 into liking me and even though they are gorgeous and I am one lucky bastard that they'd even consider me... I don't have the same feelings for them. They are sad because of me which makes me feel terrible. Sometimes I try to comfort me by telling myself that I don't want a girlfried because I fear I could become my dad as I already am quite cold on the outside and feel the coldness seeping deeper and deeper until I finally am completely cold.
Right now I'm in love with one gorgeous poor girl whose personality blows my mind. She cares about me (I think) and trusts me: We've taken some MDMA together and she was sitting on my lap because she probably doesn't even think I could be stupid enough to even think I could have a chance and while we were high we talked about our problems and she seems to have such a high opinion of me. Meanwhile I betray her and think about us being together.
I feel terrible and thusly terrible for being an asshole for feeling terrible as everybody else with my sort of miniscule teenage problems is a fucking grown up and deals with them while I am laying in my bed and don't even have the energy to go outside or do any of my hobbies. Sittin here procrastinating and wasting my time. I don't want sympathy I just want someone to either kick my ass until I've grown up or died. I don't want to talk to nobody but I guess I had to confess to someone that I'm a total piece of shit even though I feel like an pathetic asshole begging for attention.

Always check if you are mute So today I was having Zoom meeting in art. I showed one of the drawing I made and unmuted my self to tell how I made it. Once I stopped sharing my screen I forgot to mute. Sometimes I whisper when I read/write so the class was hearing whispering and we were also in the discussion of ASMR. My teacher found out it was me and I immediately muted myself and said I had to go since either way I had to eat. This taught me a lesson to always check if you are mute or not.,0

"WoohooSo I’ve been thinking about suicide in the last year or so. Ways, reasons, how to do the least damage to other people, all that stuff. There’s nothing particularly wrong with me. I have okayish grades but worsening, a decent amount of friends but only a few really good ones. I just feel like life is pointless though. Like “woohoo! I get to spend the next few years going to school to go to work to retire to die.” Life has no meaning to me. I don’t exactly want to kill myself but I would definetly not object to someone shotgunning me in the head. So yeah. Just wanted to get that off my chest.

Everyday I think and utter to myself the words ""I want to die"" when I am alone, and I dont even know why. I cant find purpose to continue on living but Im too scared about the fact that if I dont continue on living, how would my family and friends react to it.

Not to mention the fact that he broke up with me once in November and then got back together with me only to later say he regretted doing so and felt it was more of an impulse. Theres also school. After missing out on qualifying for my major by one point I'm stuck taking a bunch of electives and three day a week classes I dont care for until my GPA gets brought up. And then theres work. While everything else for me ought be changing work is still shitty as ever. And I'm about to be double fucked. Because of my work schedule my only days off are Tuesday and Wednesday. Except I have classes on those days ao no matter what day it is I have some shitty obligation that's gonna take up most of my time. I have no time for friends, video games, I dont even have time to watch movies something I love to do and is what I want a career in cause I'm too busy focusing on other things that force my time. I dont even have time to find a new person to love cause I'll be too busy with school and work so It'll be miserable loneliness for me. Yaaaaay. So what I ask is is there even a reason for me to care anymore? To keep going? Cause right now I'm not seeing it. When your best friend says they'd be fine if you decided to leave them it doesnt do a great job of convincing you that you have a ton of meaning to that person. My life over the past few months has been hell and I just want it to end. At this point why go on with the struggle? Oh and before all you thirsty nice guys say how you'd treat me right, let me just say I'm a guy as well sp dont even bother. I want actual people to talk to, not someone who cares more about his cock than a persons well being.",1

"I Don't want to live but afraid of mental and physical trauma accompanied before deathI just want to write this somewhere, I have no one to tell how I feel. I have failed in life miserably both in materialistic and spiritual life. I have no specific skill set no friends. I am a huge disappointment to my mother and my father . I keep wondering and questioning why was I even born. I remember my mother telling that when she was about to give me birth there was shortage of blood and I was dying before I could even open my eyes but my uncle came for blood donation. I often think if he was late I would not be here. Its true one have to struggle in life to achieve something I don't know if I tried enough or not probably I didn't but you see at this point of time I don't want to anything good I just want nothingness I feel all the struggle in this world pointless.

"tired...It's almost 3am where I live and once again I'm thinking about ways to kill myself. I haven't done much research on it but I'm thinking about taking a bunch of sleeping pills and then telling my bf to choke me to death while I'm sleeping. No idea if it would work but I'm sure he would help me do it. I just don't want it to be painful, everything is already painful enough.

I'm just really tired of this constant stress and problems. I'm going to be homeless in 2 months unless I find some ways to make quick money. I can't live on the street with 2 cats. I even thought about growing and selling weed, that's how desperate I am. Everything is slowly turning into shit and I can't find a way out. I have so many fucking debts and I'm not making enough money to pay it all. It would be easier if I was dead. I'm willing to give everything up. I don't hate life but this is not the life I want.

"I GENUINELY believed it would be ok.So I accepted this special supplement for research earlier this year. Last year, really.  It's at an Ivy League.  I was excited.  I grew up in poverty in an abusive home with addicts and I also have cerebral palsy and a non-verbal learning disorder.  I spent my early years getting my head slammed against walls at home and forgotten in the classroom. Nothing special. I was the dumb girl, so it was better not to set expectations and to just let me fail.  I didn't really attend high school. I didn't even picture going to college until my junior year. I worked super hard and got into uni to try to get out of that life. I was passionate about science. I did everything right.  I didn't sleep so I could study. I went out once my entire freshman year and took flash cards with. Sophomore year started the same.  I poured everything into school and research.  Right as second semester started, I was raped at a party. A get-together I guess. I didn't realize that there were expectations until it was too late. But I tried to do everything right. I spent 30 hours a week in the tutoring center to try to catch up on the algebra I hadn't learned beyond fifth grade. It worked. I was a straight-A student.  I fuck up a lot of shit, but I work hard and I overcome so much.  

I couldn't function. I tried to ask for help but it was hard.  When I got counseling, my confidence was betrayed (and no, it shouldn't have been) to cover the school's ass. I couldn't recover. I transferred twice.  I took almost 8 years to graduate and spent so much time trying to hold myself together. Lab was the only place I felt safe.  The school was my home and I had family there.

I had a mentor that cared about me. We were so close.  We don't talk anymore. She was the first stable adult I knew.  My family was in that school and I lost it.

I tried to pick up the pieces. Find my lab family and some stability and a good counselor.  Just couldn't do it.  I thought this would be my opportunity to find my professional footing. And there was health insurance! I could get help.  I was doing better, but I could really work to be strong.  But I got here and the mentoring plan the NIH created wasn't followed.  It was completely falsified.  A post doc started touching me, and my PI shrugged it off.  My reagents purchased with federal funds were disappearing.  The disability accommodations I was promised before coming were nowhere to be found. My lab mates are verbally abusive.  I've never seen this before.  I don't think it's me, because it's never happened before in any lab I've been in, and I've only ever left a lab if a PI or I left the state.  I've always gotten on with my lab mates.

I tried to get help and the whole thing blew up.  The school started an ""investigation"", but didn't talk to anyone who could corroborate what I experienced.  

I have no support system. Jobs for people with disabilities are tough.  Accommodations are OFTEN not provided.  I can't survive.  I don't know what to do.  My mom is sick and won't recover.  I just don't even know what to do.

I can't even verbalize this all.  It seems scattered, but it's been so much trial.  I try so hard. I was working 110+ hour weeks and balancing that with school. I don't expect anything to be easy.  I didn't expect this to fix everything. I just wanted to have an equal opportunity to succeed-and that didn't happen. Now I'm stuck in this weird transitional period, and there's no way out.

I just feel like the pain will never stop.  I can't do it anymore.  I don't want to struggle this much for this kind of existence. I feel so alone. I worry about being homeless. I feel totally unsupported.  I never expected my PI to be my friend or to discuss or help with personal things. I just wanted an opportunity to be a scientist.

"I feel like my life’s been leading up to me committing suicide but I’m to stubborn to go through with it.I’ve never posted on here, mainly because my writing skills aren’t the best but I’m at the end of my rope, but here it goes. It was back in 2009, I met this girl on MySpace. I was an extremely awkward 17 year old and wasn’t the best with girls. I dealt with depression since I was about 13 so that didn’t help either. Anyways, this girl was beautiful, funny, and most of all easy to talk to. We hit it off well until I found out one thing. She was already talking to one of my friends. They weren’t dating yet so I didnt think too much about it, I even let my friend know and he was fine with it, probably because of my awkward nature. Over time it became very clear that her and I had feelings for each other, we’ve hung out a few times as friends and talked most nights, I didn’t feel good about myself because I knew my friend liked her too but when you’re always depressed and someone makes you feel worth something it’s hard to just turn that away. One night after we hung out I walked her to her door and she kissed me. I was so happy that I didn’t even think about my friend. Obviously that caused a rift in our friendship but I’m going to skip all that because we are absolutely fine now and that’s not the reasoning for this. We chose to not date at the time because I didn’t want to be that guy to my friend anymore and they ended up actually dating so I left it alone. Jump to March 2016, her and I still talked and flirted every now and then, keep in mind that her relationship with my friend had been over for a little while now, and one day we decided to give it a try. She was living with her brother and his soon to be wife and I was living with a friend in the same town, at first it was perfect! My depression disappeared and I felt like I would never go back. We made the stupid decision to move fast because we thought that since we’ve known each other for so long we would be fine so I moved out of my friends house and lived with her at her brothers until we got our own apartment a couple months later. She ended up pregnant less than 3 months after we started dating and now I have an amazing son but the problem was, when he was almost born I was terrified. I admit that I was far from the best person at those points in time, always stressed and my anger was getting worse, it didn’t help that she was Mint the cleanest person ever but I knew that going into the relationship. Not long after I found her talking to another guy so I started working on my anger and I managed to get it under control (keep in mind that I never once hit her) but even after getting better I caught her talking to her another guy. Fast forward to about a month ago. Our landlord sold her property and so everyone living there had to leave. I had the choice of moving in with a friend or moving in with my dad, which is a place I never wanted to go back to. I love my dad but we have a horrible history when it comes to living together. She was going to live with her brother and his now wife so that we could have a “break”   But they ended up telling her nevermind within a week or so of needing to move out so against my better judgement I decided to move in with my dad so that she could come with me and would have a place to stay, my friends wouldn’t let her come because as of that time I caught her talking to around 15 guys and they didn’t like me being with her. I tried and tried to do better but everytime things seemed to be going well there would be another guy I catch her talking to and I’d slip further into depression. She left me three weeks ago out of nowhere while I was about to get this nice job that would have changed everything. Now I’m stuck at my dads with no car because she had the only one after mine was totaled, I couldn’t take the job due to having no car, and the town I am in has very few job options and the one I’m at has no opportunity to move forwards. In other words I’m stuck. Luckily income taxes are coming in soon but that doesn’t help my depression. I have an almost 2 year old son and his dad is living with his dad with no car and barely any income. I feel depressed and I wonder why it still hurts me that she left even knowing all that she did to me. I just wanted a family to take care of and come home to but I feel like life has always been pushing me to suicide and I’m to stupid to go through with it. I love my son but I feel like he’d be better without me. Someone please say something that’ll motivate me to do right and stick around, I’m tired of doing nice things only to be screwed over and as much as I feel like suicide is the right choice, I don’t want it to be....",1

I dont know what I'm going to do with my life after high school. I cant seem to find someone to love, but for all my friends it's so easy. I can never fully integrate into a social circle even though I want to. My grandparents have both passed away within the past year and I have very little family left. I cant find joy in anything. Last night I took 2 tabs of acid, smoked a little bit of weed and drank a lot. I acted like such a dumbass and got mad at everyone. I nearly jumped in front of a truck moving down the road. My friends had to drive me home while everyone went back to the party. It's so fucking easy for everyone else. I wish I could just be blue pilled live a life of blissful ignorance.

When I cut myself I barely ever go any deeper then the skin layer. Does that mean I'm a wimp? Does it mean my pain isn't real? The only reason I've made it this far is because of how many people would blame themselves. It's not their fault, it's mine, everything is my fault. I don't want my parents to find my body. I just need someone to hold and tell me things will be better but they are gone and don't care. I may not kill myself tonight but I don't know how much longer I'll last.",1

I'm so angry...all I ever try to do is make people not hate me (I gave up on being likeable) and somehow I am either ignored or looked at sideways.

Now I'm living alone, nobody to talk to. I work, come home, eat, and waste time until I'm tired enough to sleep.

I really give up on trying to find my place in society but that doesn't change the fact that maaaaybe it would be nice to talk to someone? Like for real...just be genuine and be able to relate to someone

The hollow feeling I get is unbareable hence why I want to kill myself occasionally. Tonight is one of those occasions.

But I know I won't do it. I'll just have to keep living, being bored, being lonely...whatever

Maybe one day someone will just kill me. Maybe I can trip down the stairs and crack my skull open

"I've made too many mistakes. I deserve to die. If anyone, even just one could read this it would help a lot. Be the verdict.Hey, using a throwaway account for obvious reasons. I just...need to talk.

I've been getting so intensely suicidal, but it comes in waves. There's moments where I feel perfectly fine or even happy, then I'm cast into deep depression when I remember the terrible mistakes I've made. I've been wrestling with depression for four years now. I've had two suicide attempts already.

I guess you want to know about all the shitty things I've done. I guess the only thing to keep in mind is...well, I'm autistic, so sometimes because of my lack of social awareness I didn't know any better, not to mention I was fairly sheltered and homeschooled with conservative parents.

I'll let you guys be the verdict. Should I just end it?

1. When I was a little kid, like 11 years or younger, I'd sometimes open the bathroom door when my sisters or my mom or my dad was showering. Not because I wanted to get a glimpse of them naked or anything perverted like that, I just thought it was funny that they went ""EEEEEEEEEK!"" I never felt sexually attracted to my family at all and the thought of it disgusted me. I just played that prank because I didn't understand the context of why it was wrong. One day I tried it when I was like 11, and then my dad pulled me over. I was crying because I thought I was in trouble, instead he gave me the Talk. I told him I didn't like my sister that way. In hindsight, I think that was true...but I worry sometimes what if there was some subconscious sexual undertone to it??? What if I was perverted but didn't know it??? When I was younger, I might see a glimpse of a family member naked but it disgusted me, but part of me was curious. I just...I don't think I knew any better.
2. When I was like...12 or 13, I briefly touched my cat with my penis for like two seconds, then decided it was a bad idea. In fact, I used to touch all sorts of surfaces with my penis at that age. That thought just revolts and disgusts me now. I feel like such a horrible person.
3. When I was 15, a 12/13 girl admitted to having a crush on me and I wasn't sure how to respond because a girl had never told me that before. I did some thinking, and I decided to tell her that while I was flattered, she was too young for me and that since we were at different stages of emotional development, it wouldn't be a good idea. The only issue is was that her uncle decided to take away her electronics for some reason, so I decided to bike to her house, and I got her address from a mutual friend. I told her how I felt, but I said she was a beautiful, kind person because I didn't want to break her heart and make her feel that I was rejecting her because she was ugly or anything. She hugged me and told me that meant a lot to her, but as it turns out she was already dating another guy who was 15. Back at my age I thought I was doing the right thing but in hindsight I just find this really creepy and cringey.
4. When I was 17 I was at a homeschool prom and we were doing group photos and I stood behind this girl. She bumped into me on accident like three separate times, but I didn't move a muscle. I asked her if I was okay to stand there and she said it was fine. I never did anything, but she kept brushing into me and I let it happen. But...part of me enjoyed that. And that just feels very twisted in hindsight.
5. Sometimes I watch porn because well...I'm lonely. I've never had a girlfriend, mainly because I lack confidence and good social skills. I never watched porn where I thought the actresses were underage or non-consenting...but like, what if one of my assumptions was wrong? What if I saw something that was illegal and didn't even know it? That thought keeps me up at night. One time, I did encounter a website on accident that seemed to be hosting some very suspicious images of what might have been underaged girls. Horrified, I reported it, but I felt horrible. Some part of me kept telling me I was a monster. I didn't sleep at all that night, and I started shaking and crying at work, but I couldn't tell my boss what was wrong. I just had to beg him to let me home early. One of my coworkers saw me crying and comforted me in the parking lot. I never told her what I saw, but she told me to be strong. I got so close to suicide that night. Some voice in my head just tried to convince me I was a pedophile, even though I wasn't and I had tried to do the right thing.
6. I sometimes get these intrusive violent, sexual, or racist thoughts. I have been diagnosed with OCD but the thoughts are so powerful they start to feel like impulses. Now I actively avoid being close to any woman because I'm afraid I'll bump into them on accident or worse, I'll act on a sexual impulse. I never, never, ever want to do that and the thought scares me.

I just feel like a monster. An absolute monster. I'm carrying this constant shame and guilt everywhere I go. I've told my dad and some of my friends about these issues, and they tell me I'm just worrying too much. That these things aren't as bad as I think they are. Are they right?

"Easiest and most painless way to die?I know I've made a post on here previously, which I deleted not too long ago, but it's here again. It never really went away. For the first few days after my first attempt everything felt like hell, but it got better. Or at least I thought it did. After a week had passed, I was feeling shit again and as the months went on, it got worse. I've been trying to get help, but it hasn't helped at all. It took about 2 months to get a fucking referral, and I haven't heard anything from them since. I'm pretty sure my care manager just wrote me off as an attention-seeking teen. My family hasn't been much help, but what can be expected from them, I'm pretty sure they hate me anyways. They don't know what's wrong with me, why I'm like this and they think I can simply stop doing this, when I choose too. I haven't gotten a proper diagnosis yet, but I'm pretty fucking sure I'm depressed because the last few months I've been barely able to drag myself out of bed, and take care of myself. Not to mention my anxiety has gotten worse, the worse it's ever been. All most all of last week was one giant, clusterfuck panic attack. Which I had to endure in school. My incredibly Christian school, which has been no help whatsoever. I'm not out there, because I'm pretty sure they'd kick me out, which I can't afford to have happen. Every other school in the area is even worse, shitty dead-end schools for even shittier dead-end people. Throughout all of this the only person I've had to rely on is my mom and my best friend. The former who is now sick of me, and at every possible opportunity, she will scream at me and dismiss me. My best friend on the other hand, has no idea what to do for me anymore. 

I just want this to stop, everyday hurts like hell. I feel like I've been hit by a bus. My body hurts so much, and I've got a constant headache and I can't sleep properly. I can feel myself declining. No one's helping me anymore. No one cares about me anymore. I just want to know what the easiest and most painless way to kill yourself is.

Im only 21 so i guess this is foolish but logically it doesnt matter. I've been so driven by my feelings lately and sometimes they cant be justified by logic.

But this uncertainty, this distance between me and her further driven by the pandemic, having to wait all this time to see her and see where her heads at only to know theres a chance she just sees me platonically, it makes me want to give up. I can't stand waiting all this time. I think ill be okay but I want your advice, words, anything you can offer to a young motherfucker in love with a girl who might not love him back in the same way.

"i posted a few days ago, deleted it, and I'm gonna retry. I am completely human trash, and i want to die.I'm not here for pity points. I'm not here for your 'I'm sorry's' or really anything. I just want to know that I'm not going to make a dumb decision. That I really am human trash.

All I know is that since I've been in elementary I've been a mentally fucked up child. Not only am I a transgender male, but I have possible borderline personality and a lot of other shit.

I'm numb all the time, and when I'm not numb, I'm sad. Scarily sad. I'm not ever happy. I've been dreaming of transitioning for awhile, but my dad won't let me get a job (and since I'm underage it's not like I can just spite him.) It's cause I'm apparently too lazy, and I'm starting to think he's right.

It's just, I don't wanna be here anymore. I've done so much bad, and I don't think I'll ever do any good. All I am is a waste of human. Who's gonna love me when my emotions are all over the place? And now because I know I'm in the wrong body, the entire worlds against me. I bet a few of the people here already want to argue with me, or turn me back just cause they disagree with me.

I'm also setting myself up for financial crisis's. I'm already poor, but paying for hormones or surgery is already gonna add financial strain.

I'll never ever be able to be who I truly am, I'll never be able to get anyone to love me, I'll never have any friends, my family is going to leave me all behind eventually when they learn how fucked I am. No one likes me, no one wants me, no one wants to get to know me.

My only escape is the internet. The community here is so nice. But it will never help me. It won't be enough to change me. I'm clinging on to false hope that things will be okay.

I've become so depressed, so isolated, so lonely that even a small compliment makes my entire day, and I'm scared that it'll become a bad habit that'll make me cling to toxic people. I hate being so vulnerable.

Being so isolated due to COVID-19 has made things worse. I might actually kill myself. I might do something that I'll end up regretting, possibly. So all I want to know is will I really regret it? I don't expect my life to ever turn around. I don't even have a college fund and the university I want to go to is private.

Mind you, this has been ongoing for years. Years of this pain, ever since elementary, and I'm in highschool.

I don't expect to get many responses. I hope you are having a better life then me. If I do end up doing anything, I'll make another post - maybe.

Thank you.",1

"I turn 27 in a few minutes. I'm in my room drinking alone on a Saturday and I'm having suicidal thoughts again for the first time in nearly 10 years.I have supportive friends and family - hell, I have a group of friends upstairs right now at this very moment hanging out and having a good time. But here I am, alone in my room drinking straight vodka with the lights off because I simultaneously don't want to be sober, but also hate my body too much to afford it some form of sweetened mixer.

I feel inexorably isolated from every person I interact with. As if I can't open up and be myself near any living person.

I have a stable job in a relatively cutting edge field that pays well. One where I've been promoted consistently and feel appreciated for my efforts - but I feel no satisfaction from my work whatsoever.

There isn't a single source of motivation in my life that feels worthwhile.

I've sought therapy for things in my past but I feel as if I just tell these people what I think they want to hear.

I feel disgusting when I have to rely on other people for anything, and as a result - here I am, wanting desperately to reach out to someone I know, but feeling paralyzed and unable to.

I was given an inheritance when my grandpa passed in the form of a .308 bolt action rifle. 

Over the past few weeks I withdrew all $25k dollars from my retirement fund, on top of everything in my checking account.

Right now nothing feels more compelling than to sober up, write an informal letter distributing my belongings and money between the people I know, exit my house, load the rifle into my trunk, drive somewhere far out into the woods - and then walk out into a field and end it all.

I don't want my death to inconvenience the people around me. I don't want my brains to stain my car, so someone can take it and use it in my place.

... I know I'm not going to do any of this. I have responsibilities.

But those things don't change the desires to do it, or this overbearing feeling of isolation.

So now, feeling so disconnected and lost, I still wish I could follow through. I've nearly left the house tonight for a new (similar) place to do it, but then just felt the heaviness of depression weigh down and I think, ""maybe if I just sleep for a while"" or some crap. Though at the same time, I wonder if I just getting starting it over with that it might not be so hard. Attempts in the past weren't as hard because I knew there was a possibility of survival, but desperately wanted to be close to death. Now I'm much more concerned with it working if I'm going to bother at all.

Things have been getting progressively worse as the years go by. I live in almost constant fear and paranoia. Panic attacks come daily and psychotic episodes are thrown into the mix a few times a week. 

Im a senior in Highschool and all I can think about is how I'll never finish and how behind I am. I think all the time about how lonely I am and how I don't have friends. All of that is my fault though. I've lost most, if not all motivation to get up in the morning, to go to school, make friends, and live a normal life. It's my fault that I'm not working hard enough to help myself. It's my fault that it got to this point. 
I'm about ready to give up. The only thing I think about lately is death and I'm scared. ",1
"Boyfriend Wants to Die Young... Really YoungHi all, 
I (20F) have been in a relationship for about 2 years with my boyfriend (20M), I’ve known him since primary school. 

From the beginning of our relationship he has expressed the desire to die young. I have heard people say they don’t want to live past 50, 40, maybe even 30. My BF, however, has told me he doesn’t want to live past 25. 

At first I thought he wasn’t serious, but as years pass, and he continues to express this, I realize that he is likely serious, and 5 years goes by faster than you might think. 

We’re both attending University now and I intend to attend graduate school, and I can’t imagine losing him at what is essentially the start of our careers and our lives. If I say something along those lines he says I’m selfish, that he shouldn’t have to be miserable for the rest of his life because of his attachments to friends and family. 

Is it selfish to want a future with someone who is apparently miserable deep down, for reasons that exist beyond the relationship?

He’s also expressed that he doesn’t want kids, which I’m okay with, but I hate to think that He doesn’t want kids because he doesn’t intend to live long enough to raise them. 

I don’t necessarily want to live to be old either, especially if I choose not to have children. I’ve watched elderly family members experience crippling health conditions including dementia and the thought of my body outliving my mind or vice versa is a deep fear of mine. 

So in a sense I can relate to him, but 25? Bluntly, I feel that (especially) if you don’t want to make extensive plans for success later in life you could live spontaneously for long past 25 and have a plethora of unique experiences or take risks. You could travel, see the world, take a shitload of drugs, I don’t know.

Overall he doesn’t engage in risky behavior or anything that would make you assume he doesn’t value his life. He doesn’t drink or dp drugs. He is in school. He has a great relationship with his family. Loads of artistic talent. From the outside, someone would think he’s got a lot to live for. 

I dealt with similar thoughts as a young teenager. I didn’t plan to live past 16 at one point. The year I turned 15 was one of my lowest if you can imagine. I hung out with an older crowd, abused alcohol, prescription meds, coke, etc. I struggled with an eating disorder and engaged in other forms of self harm. 

That year I made an attempt on my life by taking sleeping pills and drinking alcohol. I woke up in the middle of the night experiencing sleep paralysis. I thought I was dead. I thought that after you die, you were still fully conscious. For what felt like hours I thought about what it would be like when someone found me, at my funeral, if I was in the ground forever or cremated. It was intense. 

I was okay, puked and hallucinated for a couple days. After that things got better, not linearly, but I’m in college now and things are good. 

What I’m getting at is, I’ve been there, but I still don’t throughly understand. I love him dearly, and I promise that over these years I’ve tried to have in depth conversations about why he feels this way, but no matter how long the conversation goes on I’ve never gotten a real answer. I’ve  checked in to see if he was actively suicidal, and the answer has always been no. 

What I’m asking for is perhaps some perspective from people that may have felt this way before, or some guidance on having a very real conversation with him about this topic. 

Thank you.",1
"I gave myself an end dateI've been someone who has been depressed for a long time. I don't tell many people as the few I do tell either don't believe me as I'm able to play happy or tell me that my life is good enough that I don't deserve to call myself depressed and say there are other people out there that have it worse. They aren't wrong. However I've gotten to the point where I just don't want to be alive anymore. I don't think there is really anything after death and quite frankly I don't care. However I don't know exactly how I want to go. AFAIK there isn't one nice clean method. I've given myself a little over 4 months to plan how I want to go though sometimes I don't think I'm going to make it that long. 

I'm also afraid of how the people in my life will react. Obviously I know some will be sad and some will be angry and I do feel for them, but ultimately I think everyone would be better without me. I just hope that there is a way for them to understand that this is what I really wanted and to forgive me for any pain I cause. 

I wish there was a way to let them understand that this wasn't an easy decision to come to and that it is the decision that I want more than anything else.",1

"Shopping IS AWFUL Finally was allowed to go out to London, a place other than trees and forests (Iâ€™ve only been on picnics for 5 months)

And I have to say... shopping is terrible.. before you walk in, thereâ€™s these large bouncer looking type men at every entrance staring at you while you walk in, and it makes it uncomfortable from the beginning.

Then the shop employees follow you around and keep and eye on you (also very uncomfortable), you canâ€™t actually touch any beauty products, like perfume etc... (why would I go shopping if I canâ€™t touch or try anything on?)

I had the same experience at every other shop, and combined with not being able to breathe under a mask... it was not a pleasant experience.

I donâ€™t think I want to go back to shopping ever again if thatâ€™s how uncomfortable itâ€™s going to be, I think corona is completely going to wipe out all these types of business and stores, the future will be completely online, and social distanced... and itâ€™s scary.

Anyways, I donâ€™t think anyone would care enough to read about what I did today, but if you did, what do you think the future will look like?ðŸ˜‚",0

"From death with loveSuicide is the third largest cause of death in young people in USA and I think this will be the biggest cause of death in coming days if we don't have a nuke war. 

I spend time around and I see you people helping others by picking up a point to somehow trigger the momentarily love of life. This is actually insane because the person may stop for now and will do it later on. Life was shit, life is shiter and it will be the shitiest soon as the world is becoming a damn better place. Too many people in the world. Remember the dialogue of transformers movie ""We don't need you now because we can make you now"". This is a fact. 

I am close to reaching the boundary line of neglecting the situation of the world without me. The World is nothing just a bunch of lies. You were told made up lies and you are being told made up lies. 

I had really beautiful ideas of life and career after graduating and once I was graduate I saw that the world is really ugly. There is no point of doing good or bad at all. It is based on lies. If someone wants to go to permanent sleep then what's wrong with it? Eventually, the person is going to die sooner or later. Life is NOT beautiful.

"By the time I feel like I've been 'sorted out' I won't have any time left to live so...I can't help but catastrophize everything time related that pertains to me 'getting better' for whatever that means and it constantly draws me back to the quick solution of ending my life.

As I see it, I've got years of therapy which in theory could help me attack my deepest issues but then it still won't change the way I look so it's going down a rabbit hole to nowhere.

Of all the things I need to change about the way I look, I desperately need to get my teeth sorted out which means waiting until the end of February for an appointment with the orthodontist to start the process of treatment which will take years and the results of that may still not be satisfactory to me. (I've got a lisp and I want rid of it more than I want to end my life but they've given no guarantee it'll go away with my mouth sorted out)

I could then have sorted teeth but still the rest of me will look awful so I still won't find anyone so I'll still be lonely and still despise the way I look so I'm back to square one only many years older and many thousands of pounds worse off.

I could carry on going to the gym but then end up completely ripped and super healthy and still completely unattractive in both my own and the opposite sexes eyes.

I could forget about finding someone and accept being single and on my own so then I'll start thinking about what I actually want to do just for me.

I could apply for a TEFL course and voyage abroad but not enjoy it and I could apply to do a sociology and psychology course but not enjoy that either. I could try my hand at many a different thing with the end result being me a bunch of years older and still at the absolute bottom of the food chain.

I could do a great many things and have nothing to show for it and still be utterly miserable. In fact, I'm pretty sure I'll do exactly that and that's exactly what will happen.

Or I could just end it all now and save myself the trouble and the easy option is always better than one you've actually got to put effort into without guarantee of success right?

That gnawing thought of you can do this but this'll get you down anyway is always there and I just want a way out.

I'm already doing everything I possibly can to push everyone away from me to ease the lingering guilt I'd have for dropping it on everyone left behind.

It's the irrational side of your head telling you to just get it over with but it sounds so much more rational than the wait and see side does.",1
"Not Sure If This CountsSo recently I have been doing these things. I don't think of suicide, I don't think I want to kill myself but I keep doing these things.

I don't wear seatbelts and constantly think of flying through the windshield. I put myself in situations where something bad may possibly happen to me and I am curious if this counts as suicidal thoughts. 

Thanks for the help in advance. I am worried for myself and people around me and if I should get help or not. ",1

Edit: I figured I should tell a little about myself...
I am 15 year old boy named M. Suffer from BDD and depression. I just got informed that I have to start taking 80mg anti-depressants each day now which equals 4 pills. That basically means that there is something wrong with me. None of my friends are on pills like that. I haven´t actually tried to kill myself before but the thoughts have always been there.

I´m very good at school - the only thing I do when I´m home is to basically study. I love to study languages, especially german. My goal was to move to München when I finished high school. I live in Sweden by the way.

Edit: I have to take a shit at the moment. My stomach is acting very strange. I will update you on my android phone. And - I´ve never been so happy in my life!!! Every time I feel suicidal - 6 caffeine pills will go down my throat! This is the best thing I have ever done.

"""If you were REALLY suicidal, you wouldn't tell anyone about it. You'd just do it.""Those words were said to me hours after I attempted suicide and was recovering in the hospital, trying to get my kidneys to work. 
I called 911 on myself because I knew I wasn't gonna die anyway. At least, not for days and days after the overdose of the medication I chose. I was told by my guardian that I did it for attention. Totally not true, for the record. Instead of supporting me like I really needed it, most people turned their back on me or punished me in some way. I spent 2 weeks in a psychiatric hospital. That was my 8th inpatient hospitalization for the same reason.
I was really suicidal. I still kind of am, just not as strongly as I was then. I've tried to move on and not attempt again. I haven't told anyone I'm feeling this way again because I don't want them to think negatively of me again. I'm so tired of being alone.

"I have nothing leftI’m 16 and for probably the past three years I’ve been really depressed like to points where I almost killed myself a few times but I always could stop mysef before I did it cuz I thought there must be something good out there and then I met a girl and we dated for over a year but then we broke up over some dumb shit and I didn’t fight for her cuz I struggled too much woth mysef and then I realized what a fool I was and I tried to get her back but it was too late and I literally don’t have anyone else at all, like all my “friends” aren’t actually friends it’s not like they would never do anything with me it’s just they don’t really care about me I always have to hit them up and they don’t show any affection towards me it seems like they wouldn’t even notice if I would just disappear. Yeah and like rn I’m at such a low point I have nothing left to live, I have no friends or any other people who love me and I have nothing else either like nothing gives me joy anymore all I can think about is death, I’m in constant pain I even tried to self medicate with drugs but that just made everything worse tbh. I don’t even know why I bother writing this or what I’m expecting from y’all but I think maybe it will help if some people on the internet know my struggles before I die.",1
"Please be careful what kind of advice you give to people. I know I may come across as an asshole here. Most of you will think what I say here is dangerous, but I wish I had been told this when I was a teenMy biggest regret is that I didn't commit suicide earlier. When I was younger and had fewer people who loved me. When my family and I hated each other. When I didn't have coworkers, customers, roommates, a dog, best friends and family who rely deeply on me. I'm the social glue that holds so many groups together. I'm so instrumental to so many peoples lives. 

Yet, all I can think about is how I wish I had never gotten to this place and I had killed myself when I was a teen. It's horrible. I feel stuck now. Like I would ruin so many lives and hurt so many people. I saw one of my best friends suffer when her childhood best friends suicide and it horrified me. I can't imagine putting my family and friends through that. I get visions and dreams of the utter misery I would cause people if I killed myself and I hate it. I just can't do that to people. 

I thought making a difference in the world, donating money, helping other, having girlfriends, having sex, making money, having friends, partying, getting therapy, getting on a new SSRI, etx. would finally make me happy. And it does. Don't get me wrong. There are moments of pure bliss. But are they worth the hours, days, weeks, months and years of what feels like indefinite suffering and pain? All the happiness and bliss is so temporary. The normal is pain. I feel like my only purpose in life is to ensure others don't suffer while I suffer the vast majority of the time. I wish I could end it. I wish I hadn't gotten to this place.

Please just listen to suicidal people. Don't tell them to hold out and have false hope. Just listen and empathize. It's so fucked up, but in a lot of ways I wish someone told me this when I was younger. That I would get to a place that so many people rely on me that I feel like I'm not allowed to end my suffering. I hope that once my mom dies I can finally do it. But for now, it's decades of more pain and suffering for me.",1
I can't believe how loopy people areThey want a system of control. They want some people controlled like animals. Not all. Just some of them. The others get a free pass to do whatever they want. I feel so powerless I might have to end it. It's liberty or death.,1
"Scared of the abyssWell I'm not exactly suicidal anymore, but only for good reason. I'm extremely depressed because I am alone and have no family left. and also I just had a terrible past, abused severely as a child and a broken home I'm 18 now almost 19 and am a recreational pot smoker.( helps me cope And sleep) Well I went from being okay and at peace with the thought of death. But I realized something after I tripped way too much acid for the first time. I realized there's nothing after death and it's terrifying I looked right into the abyss and nearly lossed my mind in the process I just want to better my life now but I have awful trust issues since I was never shown love as a child only physical abuse, neglected and abandonment as a child I'm not really sure what to do.",1
.I have no idea what to say so I'm going say this I'm going end my life all together on August 20th I can't fight my depression anymore its been 3 years I attempted suicide 18 times and self harm on my head and arms and tights I really don't want to be here I never want to wake up every day is same I'm alone af and bored af nobody talk to,1

The friends I do have outside of uni are only because of my sister, this is how much she does for me, even giving me her own friends in an attempt to see me happy but it just doesnt feel the same. My 'best-friend' pushes me aside when anything is wrong and so I have no-one to share my feelings with, no-one to game with, no-one that makes me feel happy.

"I don't think I'll be around for much longerI have no family of my own. My mother is dead. My father seems more distant than ever before. I'm a fuckup to the point it's just sad. I've accomplished nothing but ruining myself financially since graduating university 13+ years ago. I've reached a point beyond depression into a numb realization that I'm probably not going to be around to see my 40th year. In fact, I hope I don't. I'm glad I haven't had any kids. I'm glad I'm not married and that my romantic relationships have not worked out because putting anyone thru who I am would be sadistic. My hope is that when I finally do what needs to be done, I am found by someone to whom I am just another body. 
The numbness is a new thing. It's an uneasy peace. It's uneasy in that the prospect of non-existence is an unknowable thing. All I have ever known in existence and not existing is at the same time, not knowing. 
It is weird though, knowing that even if I weren't so financially and socially fucked, it still would mean nothing.  I could be rich and well-known and it would not change the fact that I just do not want to experience life anymore.  
I just hope that I am forgotten quickly. I don't want to be remembered. I want all of my personal effects to burn. I want my name erased from what little insignificant history I have made. I've done nothing worth remembering so my death won't be worth remembering either. I can only hope that it doesn't inconvenience too many.",1

"My son who was so pure and kind just committed suicide in the UK .. far far from home. About 14 hours by planeI lost my son eleven days ago.  He committed suicide,  as he had severe emotional issues ftom horrible and I mean horrible things that happened to him when he was young. He had just be diagnosed,  two months ago with severe Ulcerative Crones disease... He went to Europe. There was no Stelara ( crones Med) there. He knew he’d suffer ...He thought he’d be happier far away. He always thought he be ok far away. Never stayed in one place too long.   He was so sick from a flare up of his crones he went from 175lbd to 110lbs.  He was a Skelton.  His bones sticking out. His pictures made me cry and cry and cry.  He then felt very vulnerable and he couldn’t live with  “not having power”.  as someone evil took his power away when he was young. Someone offered him to stay at there house- there were sick gross people but he thought everyone was nice like him.    He also had brain damage from a previous suicide attempt gone wrong. So then my son had brain damage so he believed everything anyone said. He was 30 so I could not force him to stay home. He kept leaving home.  Running away from himself. always going to places far away and many times dangerous countries. But when he travelled before,   he was sharp, smart, aware picked out lies, bs and could smell bad situations. No one could fool him. A man and his wife did quite the number on him. His health was failing.  He knew with crones he couldn’t travel anymore.  He wanted to come home to us but he was a 14 hour flight away. He was took weak saw no hope and was doing a podcast while overdosing. I am loosing it. I love him so much. He was my sage as he was so book smart and school smart. If something scared me even though I’m his mom he helped me,  he would stay on the phone for hours with me- talking making sense of things. He wouldn’t say good buy until he saw in my face I was ok. We spoke or texted everyday. It’s 11 days. I want him back. I cant walk. I dont want to see light. I dont want to eat no appetite not only that’ but I want to go join him. He was my everything. Want to write more but can barley see the screen crying too much. This is torture",1

"An open letterI’ve been depressed since middle school. I also have an anxiety disorder, and am a highly sensitive person.

I became a recluse and fell off my meds this past summer and became imminently suicidal twice, once on July 2nd and again on August 13th. I’d felt suicidal before, but this was different. The feeling was no longer met with any sense of dread, sadness, or despair, and the usual road blocks, such as what it would do to my mom or sister if I left them behind, were no longer relevant to me.

When you’re in a better place soon after a bad cycle, you tell yourself to bottle this emotion of temporary relief so that when you are in despair, you may be able to uncork it and trust your happier self that this cycle too shall pass. It’d be the same as if you made an audio recording of yourself when you were happy in order to play back to yourself when sad in order to try and talk yourself down. I’m kind of convinced that this mental note-to-self strategy is the only reason I temporarily put off killing myself. It was the next day when I was a little more clear-minded and not even necessarily suicidal that I told myself that I can no longer afford to keep playing Russian roulette with myself, and I did something I’d never done before: I swallowed my pride and pity and finally asked for help.

I didn’t even ask an old friend or a family member for help (because of the burdensome I felt). I drove to work, went to the HR lady, and told her I was suicidal and didn’t know what to do. I cried and cried and cried in her office, but looking back I think it was one of the bravest and smartest things I’ve ever done. She helped me take my first steps to a recovery I wasn’t even sure I wanted. I was taken off the work schedule for three months while I saw psychiatrists, therapists, and got back on better meds. There is a lot I went through during this time that I won’t bother mentioning, because it’s going to be a different process for everybody.

Point is this: as pointless as it may seem at the absolute worst of times, the fact is your life experience is too rare and precious to just throw it all away, although that decision ultimately comes down to you and you alone. Wouldn’t it be more interesting and amusing to see what ridiculous and crazy shit you could accomplish while you’re alive? If you don’t care what anyone else thinks of you if you were to die, why not take advantage of that feeling and not care what anyone else thinks of you while you’re alive?

History rarely remembers those who were always happy and content with their life. It usually remembers best those who were angry, emotional, and passionate—people who stood up for something.

There’s nothing I can say to take another person’s pain away, and there’s no way for me to adequately express what I’ve been through to anyone else. We all have our unique demons that we have to beat the shit out of on our own. Such is life. The only thing we *can* do is understand this much and to try to live a little more selfishly if that’s what it takes.

I did not mean to ramble on like this. Maybe I needed a little therapy session. I’ve been slipping on my daily meds lately, am still an anti-social recluse, am still having trouble motivating myself to simply shower, and just learned this afternoon as I was calling into work tonight for strep throat that one of my young, close coworkers died over the weekend. This winter feels like it will never fucking end. But I know it will eventually. Absolutely nothing in life is permanent, so see if you can learn to appreciate life’s ridiculousness, not fear it.

“The most beautiful people are those who have known defeat, known suffering, known struggle, known loss, and have found their way out of the depths. These persons have an appreciation, a sensitivity, and an understanding of life that fills them with compassion, gentleness, and a deep loving concern. Beautiful people do not just happen.”",1

"I just don't think I'm fit for this world.I apologize in advance for the lengthy post, but I would really appreciate somebody's help. Let me first say that I am a 19 year old man currently in college. I have been having on and off suicidal thoughts for a couple of years; usually I get past them, but lately I feel myself getting closer and closer to actually killing myself. I spend hours thinking about what to say in a suicide note and I get this feeling that just ending everything would leave me with no more pain. There has only been two things I've ever been super passionate about in life those are being a great dad and being a great husband. I have never been ambitious, I don't care about achievement, or money. I coasted through school because I didn't care and I was smart enough to get b's with absolutely no work. I'm doing the same thing in college right now. I have no clue what I want to major in or do for the rest of my life. I'm currently unemployed and I have never held a down job down longer than 3 months without quitting. I'm not motivated about bettering myself and I don't really take pride in hard work. I feel like a lazy parasite who only survives based on  the support of others without any independence of my own. It takes months for me to do anything in my life such as schedule a doctors appointment or getting car insurance. I hate myself for it, but I also kind of like having no responsibilities and nothing to worry about. I have really bad anxiety new work settings, new people, they all terrify me. The anxiety is worse when I'm around men. I'm a little bit more sensitive and emotional than most of the men I know and I get such a huge sense of inadequacy when around them. I'm fairly short, small, and I have no common sense or knowledge of stereotypical ""man"" things. I get terrified of looking like a fool in front of people and I shut down. This fear keeps me from doing so many things. I feel like I've fallen short of everything my family, friends, and loved ones have expected of me. My father was a great tennis star and beautiful singer, my grandfather was a brilliant band instructor and composer, and my other grandfather was a literal genius who worked for NASA. I will never stack up to that not only because I lack the skills and talents, I lack the drive. I don't want to end my life because I'm sad or my situation is bad. I know things like that change. I just feel fundamentally wrong, like I will never be more than a parasite on society unable to do my part. My girlfriend is loving and supportive and she would be devastated if I did something like kill myself as would my friends and family. I also know I that I would miss out on having the family that I've always wanted and never had. But honestly how good of a father or husband be without being able to support his family. I could write a ten page essay on how I feel, but I guess this is as good a place as any to cut off. Again I would really appreciate anybody's help.",1

"Considering itIt seems like everyone here has real reasons to be unhappy or upset with a serious aspect of their life and I just don't. I don't know why I'm so unhappy, but I am. It's been this way for the past ~2 years.

I'm not unhappy all the time. It's easy to distract myself, either with work or going out or whatever. It's whenever I stop doing things, whenever I'm trying to sleep that I just want to pull the trigger.

I think the primary reason that I haven't is because the hurt it would cause my family and friends, but the more time that passes the less I care about how it will affect them. 

Therapy or something would probably help, but I don't know what I would even say. Everything is good with my family, my friends, my job etc. To pretty much anyone in my life, I'm doing fine. I don't have a valid reason to be unhappy, but I also don't really have a reason to stick around.

At this point, I'm just writing so I have something to do, I suppose it feels good to finally say something about how I'm doing. 

Even if I achieved all of my goals, personally and professionally, I still don't think I'd be happy. I can't imagine what it would take for me to get to a place where I was content with myself. I don't know what would make me feel better.

I know it's a cop out, but it really just seems like the most efficient way of dealing with this shit. If nothing is going to make it better, then why not?

Anyway, sorry for the wall of text. Thanks for reading, hopefully you're doing better than I am.",1

"I can't stop hating who I am. I only want to be a normal woman.I am a late 20's woman and I have always hated myself. I wake up in the morning and hate my appearance, I hate how undisciplined I am, I hate my job, I hate my life, I hate how I speak, I hate where I live, everything. I hate everything about myself. This hatred of who I am has affected literally every aspect of my life. I don't try to get a nicer job because I think ""hey they won't hire me"". I don't ask out men that I'd like to because I know they would not find me attractive, I don't take any risk that would lead to a positive outcome because I know it will fail. I have been an insecure, depressed mess of a person since I was a teenager and things are not ""getting better"". Things did not change for me, they got worse. I want to improve but I physically cannot, my mind mentally blocks me all the fucking time. It's like there is a part of my soul that knows I can do better but the darkness of depression suffocates it and wins every battle.

To buy time to think what to do so I told her okay letâ€™s go on a date and this is my first time going on a date so I asked my older friends they gave me tips and stuff and just told me to be me act as myself and not someone else so couple days later we go on a date it was weird walking around with a girl not the boys anyways we go and eat sushi I never had sushi before so we sit talk just like a normal date and then after that we start walking around   she was really brave doing all of that
so I thought to myself I gotta be brave at least once and told her I have a really big crush on her and I really like her Then we stopped walking and my heart just dropped and she said I really like you too and kissed me also that was my first kiss and now we are in a relationship

"Is it ever going to get better?Medication after medication, doctor after doctor, and I'm still crazy. My mind is driving me to insanity. I hear voices all the time and I'm getting to exhausted to keep going, keep fighting. There's only so much one person can take before it's to much.
I'm holding back because of my mother and my husband. I've been married 12 years to the best understanding man I could have ever asked for and I don't want to do anything to hurt him. My mom has had a hard way to go and I don't want to make it harder but I don't know how much longer I can stand this. I don't know how much more I have left in me. Nothing is the same. I'm slow, and exhausted all the time. I can't think straight half the time, and the other half I'm scared of all my hallucinations that haunt my every waking minute. 
I know how I would do it. And I would never be home for it. Although I almost did take all my medications a couple of days ago while I was at home, but I couldn't bring myself to let my husband find me. 
I'm losing hope. I'm losing hope in medication, in life and in myself. I can't handle anything stressful anymore and I'm nothing but a burden. I can't work, I can't drive, I can't even think.

"Stagnation. Why go forward if you can never go up?I have no family. I have no friends. I live in a remote, isolated area. I have no transportation. I have no money. My body is in terrible shape, and the worst things about it are the ones I can't change. (Why lose weight if I will still be hideously mutated? I certainly have no desire to prolong my existence.) 

I don't see anything changing, in the near or far future, for better or for worse. 

I exist each day on my little, tiny corner of the planet. I eat, I sleep, and when I have enough energy, I shower. I refresh Reddit, Facebook and all three of my email addresses several times a day just to see if there is anything new.

I have a wonderful husband who loves me, despite my body. I have two cats who occasionally notice me. I keep telling myself it's enough. I keep telling myself to exist for one more day. For them. That there will be one more moment of intimacy with the man or the cats. He will kiss me one more time. One of them will climb into my lap and look up me. 

As the days and years grow longer, those moments feel ever smaller. I will be 40 soon, and all I want is for my heart to stop beating. ",1

"[Life Story] My Pathetic LifeI'm 18 (Since March)
Never had a girlfriend. Only two showed interest in my life.

 
My life has been shitty. I got molested at age 10. Watched my dad beat my mom when I was little. 2010-2013 Jr High was hell for me. I was bullied for my weight, I lost interest in girls because they would insult me over my appearance. Skipped school a lot due to this and flunked 7th grade. A family friend died from a gunshot to the head in 2012. Also in 2012, CPS takes me and my sisters away and a few close cousins in error (Long story short, Grandpa molested my cousin) so I was stuck in a group home for a few weeks. I didn't get to see my sisters or family. I cried myself to sleep every night in the group home. In 2012 my dear grandma whom I loved very much passes away in front of us in the hospital after they disconnected her from life support due to liver failure. Same year uncle passes away from brain cancer. I find myself scared of death and questioning god just leading to more depression and anxiety. I wanted these feelings to be suppressed. I started doing drugs. First with marijuana and then prescription because they were easier to obtain and hide.


In 2013 My sister and I caught my mom cheating on my dad and my
parents separated for a while; older sister stayed with my dad meanwhile me and younger sister stayed with our mom. We lost the house too. My mom tried to kill herself and I had to call 911 one time. Parents reconciled soon after and now we're living in 1 bedroom apartment struggling financially. I never went to the 9th grade because I couldn't afford all my necessary school supplies. So I decided to try Primavera Online School which just ended being a total catastrophe. A major bug in their system never logged in my school work and wanted me to redo everything from a month's lessons. So I basically dropped out of High School. Then my older sister dropped out.... mom blames me but my mother just did not want to wake up to take her to school herself. At this point in time I was just done with life. I started to lose weight slowly because I would not want to eat due to the anxiety attacks I would always have.


2014 comes and we get a puppy. It might have been the most happiest I have felt in a while. I never had a pet of any sort in my life. Well that puppy dies when I decided to sleep with it next to me and I rolled over it. My fatass smothered it and I'm a heavy sleeper. No pun intended. I blamed myself for the grief I have caused my family and the painful death of that poor puppy. I went into a state of depression that I have never felt before. I was just done and decided to turn off my emotions and say fuck it, shit happens. I think that same year I got into a physical argument with my dad (He swung first) and went to go live with my other grandma for a bit. I have done drugs very heavily from there where I couldn't leave the house without a percocet to function.
That same year a girl from Jr High I went to school with is murdered. another family friend died that same year. I didn't care anymore. I am just numb to everything at this point. Insults, appearances, being lonely, people dying, or even myself. Even my mom at this point started to change and call me names and insult and degrade me calling me gay, and fat, etc. My older sister followed soon after.


2015 comes and goes without incident. January 5th my great grandpa dies and we see him pass away too. I did not shed a tear. I just said in my mind ""farewell old man"" and left the room. Yes I did love him and I do miss him but what can I do? Besides he was suffering from his COPD and was in pain for years. I tried to kill myself by taking 18 butalbital but somehow those fuckers did not destroy my liver lol.


Now I don't take percocet anymore. But my state of mind is very stale. I feel like I am numb to everything. I felt like I never had a childhood. I never got to experienced high school where I think I would have had a better chance at getting a girlfriend. I do want a girlfriend but I don't trust girls. Everyone is with someone now so my chances are slim. I can talk to girls now, But I'm bored when I do talk to them. I am trying to find a job but who would hire a damn 18 year old drop out with social anxiety?I am very nervous to get one as I am afraid I might screw up. GED classes cost $120 a month here. I can't afford that. I weigh as much as a pencil now and I barely eat. I just watch movies I pirated and listen to music. Got diagnosed with Hashimoto's Disease and have other health issues. My mom might have cancer of the pituitary gland. I just recently noticed a lump in my right testicle that I am afraid of getting it checked out and have to live with the pain in my back and groin area. And barely sleep. I mean it's 6:49am now I stayed up all night haha


I am just thinking of ending my lonely pathetic life. I am not afraid of death but how death might feel. I'm numb to death. If I don't have emotions then I am not human in the eyes of others and am subjected to more misery and solitude in my life, social anxiety and awkwardness;More death of family and friends and more insults from my mom and sister. Really I'm laughing right now because I am pathetic. I just might take some people I fucking hate down with me as well. I dunno. I am just sick in the head now. I am done.

Edit: I mean even though they do this to me I still have love for them. I don't know why.",1
"No longer enough every semester I kill me doing the projects, today I had the beautiful news that my work from the past semester is being used by other people, people creatures have no idea",0
"I keep thinking I can't possibly feel any worse only to discover I am wrongI keep thinking ""Ok, so I got through today, I don't see how I can feel any worse and I'm still coping, so I can just keep on coping, right?""

And then there's another development.

I seem to be having occasional mini panic attacks at my desk in the office now, totally out of nowhere. No particular event or thought seems to trigger them, I'll just be sitting here trying to get stuff done and then suddenly I'm sweating, it's pouring off me, and I can't see properly, and my hands are icy cold, my heart hammers and I'm drowning in this feeling of absolute doom...

...and then in a few minutes it passes. I've gotten away with it so far, but sooner or later someone is going to try and talk to me while it's happening and I don't know that I can adequately hide it. 

I just want to go into the bathroom and vomit my soul out, to just throw up everything I think and everything I feel and to emerge again completely empty. I want to feel nothing, I want to **be** nothing.

I've set my date for October and I'm really hoping I can hold on that long. There are things I need to sort out and people that I need to cut off before I can feel like I've done the best I can with making a clean exit. 

And between now and then I've got 5 months in which things are only going to get worse. I have to hope that whatever lies in wait for me in that time isn't going to completely derail me, if I can keep working and keep up the outward appearances then I can get out without too much of a mess. 

I'm not asking for help here, I just need somewhere to put these feelings so I'm not trying to carry them all, all of the time.",1

"The Mind and Body Connection is RealI was suicidal because who I believed to be the love of my life and soulmate ended things with me. He knows I’ve been depressed and suicidal, yet he continues to ignore my calls and texts. As a result, I’ve been more anxious than I’ve ever been. I haven’t been taking care of myself. I’ve been eating terribly, not hydrating, and barely sleeping even though I stay in bed for hours at a time. So I haven’t been feeling well—-headaches, nausea, stomach pain, and so on. Again, he knows this. I’ve told him, but he’s been avoiding me instead. Well, today I landed up in the ER. I was vomiting all day. The pain in my head and lower back became unbearable. So, I went to the ER for that (not suicidal ideation) and found out I had a kidney infection. I’m in relatively good health and don’t have health issues, so for me, this was the last straw. I wanted to end my life because of this person. But because the stress from him not understanding me and avoiding me has led me to become physically ill, I am done chasing after him. He is not the love of my life and he is not my soulmate. Whoever that person is (if they even exist) would understand my depression, anxiety, and thoughts of suicide. He wouldn’t isolate me and leave me alone, confused, and sad. So if anyone out there is feeling like they want to end their life because another person didn’t “value” you, then that shouldn’t be the reason. I’ve learned the hard way that this person isn’t worth your time and energy. Because there is a deep connection between the mind and the body, so any psychologically stress will lead to chronic health issues as well. He wasn’t worth the stress. I’m better off alone and I’m realizing that’s okay and you should too. It might take a personal experience of some sort to realize it. I prayed to God yesterday wishing I was dead and then the next day I landed up in the ER. Life acts in mysterious ways. You never know what your struggle or your heartache or your loss will lead to. You may find your life purpose in that way. ❤️",1

"Want To Tell SomeoneThrowaway account for obvious reasons. 17F, for context.

I've been feeling suicidal off and on since May 2015. Last September I told my mom, who reacted unhelpfully (""Well who will babysit your siblings?""). She did take me to a therapist, but instead of acknowledging the hurtful things she says to me, she claimed that I was suicidal because of something my grandparents said 5 years earlier. I was an emotional wreck at that point, and went along with it.

I saw the therapist one more time, but that was still with my mom in the room.

Since then, I've claimed to be fine, even as recently as yesterday. I had a depression screening before a doctor's appointment. I lied on every question.

A few weeks ago I kinda-sorta tried to kill myself (half-hearted attempt, gave up the second I felt uncomfortable).

Today I felt a lot worse. I have a plan, the means to do it, and the only thing stopping me is my religion. Hey, any reason is a good reason.

I am aware that this is bad, and that I need to inform my parents that this has been ongoing, but I'm not sure how to break it. I can't just walk up and say, ""Hey, I'm suicidal. How about the weather, huh?""

Any tips for bringing it up?",1
"Think im really going to do itI have been suicidal since I was 8/9. I never thought I would do it because I was too scared. Today I realized im actually going to do it. I dont know when though. Maybe in a week? I dont know why but im really happy/excited about it.

Is it wrong to be feeling this way?",1
"I really need help.I'm on my way to work as I'm typing this to force myself, I've been struggling with balding all my life and I'm at the point where I can't take it anymore. I've tried to convince myself that I look good but I can't get it off my chest. I was not going to go into work today because I need the money but I feel broken, I've been grinding and working out to give the illusion that I'm fine but I'm dying. I wake and wonder what is the point every fucking morning why do I get up and work 60 hour weeks and act happy when I have no free time. I feel trapped where I am and just want to escape somehow, I obsess over my head all the time how it looks how people will treat me. I can't quit another job because of depression but I can't keep putting in a fake face I feel like that commercial where the women applies her face every morning. I simply don't know what to do anymore and it's holding back my life because I have no drive or passion for anything anymore. Really I don't know how to look at myself anymore because I just look terrible and sad and I'm surrounded by all these people all the time that are happy. Everyone tells me that it's all in my head and not to stop worrying. I have a wedding coming up and I'm looking for anyway to get out of it.
My. mother and brother suffer from bipolar and depression and anxiety and I just need help, I'm not begging for compliments I just don't know what to do anymore.

"I'm most suicidal on my birthdaySo, it's my 23rd birthday today. Yeah me. I have now lived seven years passed my ""no shit your last day on earth"" day and that somehow makes everything worse. I was lonely and sad the summer before freshman year. then depressed. then I made a secret pact with myself that I would die before my 16th birthday. I came close but couldn't do it. So I pushed it to 17 then 18. Then I just sort of stopped caring about everything and it became this thing in the back of my mind that I was just numb to. But every now and then I feel to much or think to long and I want to die again. This is most true on my birthday. The simple truth is I'm a failure. I fail at everything. So, instead of having lived a full 23 years of life I have just been failing to die for seven. And what sort of life is that. Pathetic. Failure. Empty.",1

"Autism is making me stressed and having depressionI think about the option of wanting to be dead every day and depress myself with the fact I am autistic, 15 years old, and can only succeed in life with learning Russian, I think about this goal everyday cause I know it will bring me happiness.

I feel my disability makes it so hard to do my goal and so are my tendencies of depression everyday and suicidal thoughts, I got a therapist but she doesn't really feel like she helps me and just asks me questions all the time and says stuff like I don't have autism even though I have it and I think its a bad thing for her to say.

I feel like there is no solution, that I always will have to be anxious for the rest of my teen years, that there is no end to this until I have reached my goal and live a better life with autism, there is a good reason why the suicide rates for autism is so high and this post is proof of the tendencies, struggles, autistic teens have to deal with, I feel this is not normal life, and that I shouldn't be having these tendencies every day.",1

"Working as a kitchen manager makes me feel like a worthless piece of shitI've been working in the restaurant industry for about 12 years. I started in college and got stuck here because the world of committed full time jobs scared me. I've been dealing with depression my whole life, but in the last 6 months it's the worst it's ever been. I've been very suicidal, especially in the last 2 months, working this insane, gruelling job. I'm salaried, and am working about 60 hours a week, outside, next to hot ovens, and inside shared, chaotic prep kitchens. I don't make any overtime, so my boss has no reason to value my time or life away from work. He says he really does, but my hours away from home certainly show otherwise. We have a very low commitment staff, so I don't feel I have anyone who supports me. The owner of the company is someone I thought I trusted and wanted to be a part of his venture. I've worked with this company for two seasons prior but never with this level of responsibility. This year he has let out his true chef nature, being very controlling and demanding, with standards that are incredibly high. He constantly criticises the work I'm doing. He says I need to manage better, and that I'm not using the resources I have efficiently enough. My partner is depressed because I'm never home, and he can see the constant emotional pain I'm in from this situation. My mom says this is an abusive job and I should leave. But I feel so stuck. I wish I could just dissappear. I've failed my way here and feel so worthless. I'm having panic attacks all the time now, at work, at home, at night. I just feel like, if I can't do this job, and maintain professionalism and a stable mind, I won't be ever be able to be responsible. I won't ever act professional enough to succeed because I have such bad depression and anxiety. At some point or other it's just going to get too real and too uncomfortable for my employer. I'm not on meds, and have considered them. I took them in high school and it was such an awful roller coaster, I'm afraid to get on again. I've tried to find a community of other kitchen workers dealing with this kind of stress-- I know they're out there, but I can't find them, even on Reddit. Everyone seems to be so proud of all the gruelling  hard things that are leading to the state that I'm in. I just want out any way I can find it and lately the numerous bridges in my town feel like it. ",1

"Anyone else just feel that suicide is their inevitable?When I was 16 years old (2015) I journalled. I sort of wanted to see my character development and for good reason. Now, with covid-19 and all the time in the world, I did some 'spring cleaning' in my room to clear my head and I found my journal. I flipped through what was predominantly puerile stories of your typical, happy-go-lucky teenage girl. So much so that I found an entry that hit me like a tonne of bricks. 

""I always see these posts on social media, these depressing ones, e.g. ""I want to curl up in a ball and die"". How does a person feel like this and what causes it? Note! I do not feel like that.""

I was so naive. 

I am 21 now. I have not been diagnosed with anything because I am too much of a coward to seek help. As much as I loathe self-diagnosing I know that I have multiple things wrong with me. I am so, so fucked up in the head. In a matter of 5 years my life has been turned upside down. I stay up until my family is asleep so that I can cry in my room with nobody to bother me, I fantasise about my death, I fake every single smile and I regularly have spontaneous bouts of anger. I do my best to please others but I am always the second option. Frankly, I am enjoying being forced to stay at home because that means I don't have to see anybody, go to work or university and feel anxious about how people will perceive me. I always feel the need to distance myself and that has led me to delete all social media (except Facebook for university group chats) but that does not stop me from aimlessly scrolling on it and seeing people my age getting married and having children when I have never even had a first kiss. Everyone I know describe me as a very 'smiley' person. Guess I do a good job at hiding it. But I do not know if I can do it much longer. I feel very, very alone and honestly, I do not see myself living past 30. And, if nothing else kills me by then I will just end up killing myself. It is my inevitable.",1

We’re in a long distance relation so I can’t be there for her. I’m distraught that something so bad can happen to someone as pure as her. I’ve been trying to give her the support and care she needs, it just hasn’t been working.
A friend of hers was there and he could give her physical support. I can’t do that. I was happy that she wasn’t alone, but it just broke me when she stopped talking to me.

"I want to fade out into nothing until no one is left to care whether I'm here or notBy all rights I should be proud of myself. At least that's what my parents tell me. I have a good degree. A well paying job. I worked hard enough in school to graduate early with very little debt thanks to scholarships. I'd like to think my family is proud of me for that. I'm not. I don't think I've ever been more of a miserable wreck in my life.

My fiance left me 4 years into a relationship for another guy a month before I was going to propose. This was a while ago and I'm pretty sure I've been so stressed ever since then that my hair has fallen out. I always thought I was ugly but now I look even worse.

I spend most of my days waiting until I can find an excuse to go to sleep and sleeping in as long as I can so I don't have to think about my own existence. I've turned to the bottle to numb myself throughout the day.

My productivity at work is plummeting. I feel like I don't even deserve to be at this job anymore. I hope they fire me. My social life has plummeted. My circle of friends that I actually talk to has started shrinking. I can go days, a whole week without talking to anybody. I can't talk to women. I tried asking a girl out to coffee, she gave a reluctant yes, and I over thought the whole situation so much that I broke down in a nervous fit and haven't attempted to talk to her since. I lashed out at my immediate family instead of talking to them about how I'm feeling because I don't want them to see. I can feel them distancing from me now. 

Sometimes I wonder if I was a glitch. Maybe I'm not supposed to exist. Maybe there's something so fundamentally wrong with my existence that it needs to be corrected. There was no where in my life that I ever fit. Even in my own family. I always felt like I was never supposed to be there. All of my friends and relationships have been a fluke, and everyone is going to find that out eventually. I want to cut ties with everyone, so much so that when my existence does get corrected no one will know the difference. I guess I'm doing a good job of that because the only person I can tell this to is an anonymous message board.",1

"Apology Thread &amp; Update... Not that I expect most of you to give three shits.

I have been in a really dark, awful mindset as of late. I'm snappy, I'm jaded, I'm angry at the past and most of all I'm angry at myself that I can't fix myself or stop my thoughts from racing.

I've had a really short fuse as of late. Also, I've been really closed minded to a lot of your advice.

I'm sorry. Not that I honestly expect any of you to believe me.

I have seen and been through hell. A lot of pent up anger and feelings suddenly swelled up to the surface... due to the fact this weekend is the 7 year anniversary of two of my closest friends' suicides. One where the boyfriend of the couple overdosed in my arms.

7 years ago is a long time. And usually... it doesn't bother me. But for some reason, I've exploded with emotion.

I've been thinking quite a bit now. My rage is all gone and out and I've had a few moments of real clarity. Probably fake and bullshit, but hey it felt real.

I don't want to die. Not yet. John and Jane (obviously not their real names), on top of my fiancee and other friends took the easy road out. They found a permanent solution to a temporary problem.

I'm going through a temporary problem. I have C-PTSD and I'm going through the ""it's all happening again"" stage. I really don't have anyone IRL that I can talk to about this stuff. Most of the people I've told about everything that happened I've cut off contact with everyone. I don't have a relationship very much with my parents or siblings. When a lot of this shit started, I disconnected from my family. It's not their problem or concern, so I keep it to myself. But keeping it to myself is driving me nutso.

Right now, I don't have a whole lot to live for. I have no job. I have no friends or social life anymore. I can feel the walls closing in on me, but this is all just temporary. It's just a bump (though it feels like 6 Mt. Everest stacked on top of each other at the moment) in the road. I can pull through this. 

I've survived a carjacking, I've survived being tied to a bed for 3 days and being used by a drug dealer, I've survived 4 episodes of alcohol poisoning, I've survived 3 drug overdoses. The most recent one being back in March.

Obviously I'm not going anywhere any time soon. If I was, I'd already be worm food by now. There's a reason why I'm still here. I just have no goddamn mother fucking shit fucking clue in fuck what the fuck that is.

Half the fun of the adventure is traveling to the destination, right?

So... Some good things for a change:

I've contacted my old college's Career/Job Placement office. I'm setting an appointment in a few days to get my resume written and hopefully find a job soon. I'll also be getting tips on how to handle interviews.

I'm looking for a therapist that will work with people without health insurance. No luck so far and my old therapist will not accept uninsured people. I'm probably not going to be able to get to talk to one until I get money again, but it's worth a shot at least.

In the meantime, I've picked up a hobby that I'll be able to add on my resume. I'm using CodeAcademy to get caught back up on HTML/CSS and learn all the new fandangled nonsense with HTML5.

... Jesus I've rambled for entirely way too long.

TL;DR

I'm sorry for being very manic and snapping on quite a lot of you guys that were only trying to help me. Regardless of how I acted, I did actually listen to you guys.

Getting in touch with a Career/Job Placement Center, shopping for a therapist, picked up a hobby to try and keep myself doing something productive.

Thank you to everyone.

"Concerned about my cousin?he's early 20s and im still in high school. when he was in high school and i was in elementary/middle school, he always used to tease me and was that relative that lived with you but was so annoying. he always bragged about how he was in the top of class at his top private school and my dad would always say to me that i should try to be like him and study like him and etc and it always bothered me. then my uncle (cousin's dad in case u didnt know lol) lost his job and this resulted in their family unable to afford university for him and his younger brother just a yr younger (younger brother is attending good university in native foreign country). the rest of their family moved in with us because they couldnt support themselves. fast forward, im in high school and cousin is like 24 idk, im much taller, bigger, confident, athletic than the person who used to piss me off when i was little (im still small myself lol but my cousin is just actually really small) , but currently he's living alone in a small apartment being paid by his parents who are trying to build and grow an amazon business but its taking a long time for it to catch and money is moving slow for everyone so no one could really help one another either. my cousin started smoking cigarettes, caught me smoking pot twice and then felt that he was even more justified to smoke cigarettes, hes barely and hes starting to become overweight. i dont think he's mentally capable of finding and maintaining a significant other right now if he could barely care for himself. i want to help him but its so awkward because we both know a little too much about each other's issues and our past doesnt make it any better.

I am going to counseling with a religious approach and he told me something like addicted people doesn't know drugs are bad for them and you are like this  maybe you don't know how bad was selling your nude was and effects you

"I just want out.Hi, 

I'm a 21 year old female and I just want out of this life. 

I've been thinking about it a lot lately... I feel empty and nothing brings me joy anymore. I have a few friends but spending time with them seems like a chore. Wherever I go, I find it very difficult to fit in. I feel like I'm not 'entertaining' enough for other people to take any interest in me. I'm not cool, I'm not successful in my studies, I've not achieved anything in my life. I want so hard for people to like me but I just don't have what it takes. I'm not confident or smart or funny. Most of the time I use sarcasm to cover my anxiety because I just can't handle social situations. People tell me that I'm pretty but that's all I am to them. Just a pretty girl. Guys don't like me for who I am, they just like me for what I look like and I feel like I will never be able to open up to anybody because they don't see me as worthy of more. 

 I study architecture and I like my course but I no longer have passion for it. I don't have the energy or motivation to create anything. Every day I wake up and I'm more and more behind with my coursework. I don't even try to catch up  because I don't see myself succeeding or doing well enough. I can't handle getting an average or low grade in the end because this is the one thing I chose to do based on the things I used to love and I'm not even good at it. 

It's breaking my heart to think that I will never be good enough. Not for anyone or anything. I attempted suicide at 18 because the guy I used to like in school bullied me physically and verbally ever day for a year and I was powerless. I couldn't make him stop and even his friends who watched it all happen didn't bother doing anything because they didn't want to get on his bad side. I've never been able to stand up for myself. I feel ashamed for being so weak, unable to do anything. I let people walk over because I rather compromise on how I feel than upset someone else. 

Recently, I've been feeling like I simply don't fit. Part of me doesn't want to die because I'll never get a second life. I don't believe in God. I believe that us humans, simply made it up as a backbone to our lives. We need some kind of security, we need to feel like no matter what happens there will be someone to help us out through it all and no matter how bad things get there's purpose in it all and that purpose is given by God. But I don't have that kind of security. I believe that once we die, there's no place for our soul to go. We simply stop existing and we're just part of natural selection. The world doesn't stop when we die, it simply sifts out the better from the worse. And I just want to get myself out of all this. I don't want to be a part of anything I just want to stop existing without any consequences. Fall asleep and never have to worry about anything ever again...",1

"I know I’m in hellit seems very likely. and I don’t wanna continue feeling existentially cursed. Every event seems to be directed at me, and my downfall. And I’ve fallen. And I keep falling. Every thing I do, seems to exacerbate the external circumstances. I can’t accomplish ANYTHING. I say “can’t” because I’ve been optimistic, and continued to fail. 17 years of my life. Extreme psychological abuse. Psychopathic mother. Even after I’ve escaped, and dealt with the past, reality is, I still exist. My existence seems inherently painful. Full of anguish I suppose. Surrounded by my own failures, and inability to adapt. Cursed is how I feel. I continue to try, results similar to the opposite. so I’m close to giving up. I seem to be a beacon of stress, my aura causing others to feel similarly. Exhausted efforts to try and help me. No results. I have nobody left. And I’m not exaggerating. Nobody seems to understand the inner turmoil of failing everything i try. That misunderstanding leads to strain on relationships. I’m seen as lazy. Not willing to try. But nobody sees me how i feel, trapped inside, begging for mercy from my mind. All I want is my brain to listen. but since I can search for answers so well, but I’m failing terribly at studies,(my iq is too fucking high) it’s a choice. I’m BEGGING for mercy. But I only descend farther. I’m ready to give up, but what’s the point?? I’m trapped in this reality. I tried offing myself a few years back, when I was with my psychopath(yes PSYCHOPATH, narcissist ) mother. over 100mg oxy. A handful of clonazepam. I ran into the woods. Far as I could. Yet, I STILL WAKE UP IN A HOSPITAL BED? this makes no fucking sense. And it makes me feel trapped. So I search for liberation.",1

"Being a social rejectWhat is the point of living that life? I'm 30 and never had any friends or anyone romantically interested in me. It's just straight never going to be different now, it is what it is. I find it very upsetting, particularly the hopelessness that goes with it. I know I'm right about being a reject, society has rejected me entirely. People can talk shit about ""all lives matter"" or whatever but the reality is that if you don't meet certain standards you're a shunned subhuman.

Only reason I can think of is that I hate to upset my family, but they would eventually get over it and it's selfish of them to expect me to live when every day is a living hell.",1

I find that women feminize me, and men ignore me, and I'm too old to think it's fun to be a minority. I don't really have hobbies, because what's the point? It doesn't matter if I can cook or knit or get good at yoga. Hobbies don't add anything to anyone's life, and they cost me money. Same goes for relationships, I honestly don't know why my fiancee is still with me, and if they leave me, good for them. They can go find someone who's not completely worthless, boring, and incapable of contributing anything to society. I work a fast food job because I can't afford to go back to school. I can't have a dog because my fiancee thinks our apartment is too small for a second pet. The car is on the edge of breaking down, I'm broke, and I have nobody to lean on. I don't feel like wasting money on a therapist, so that they can tell me to work out more and eat better and stop being mean to myself. I'm entirely capable of doing those things - there's just no point.

"Cutting myself has become a habitI bought a knife set (to cut fruits, as my parents believe) for my dorm room in uni and I started cutting myself last year one day when I was drunk. From there things have escalated to a point where I can't go longer than a week without cutting myself. And at this point, it actually feels exhilarating and relaxing, like good music ; and I've started using it as a tactic to stay awake to study or just get a laugh. (I laugh when I'm in pain, idk don't ask) or that brief adrenaline rush. 

Not for attention mind you, haven't touched my wrists or anywhere the scars might get spotted but I've started considering my neck. How do I stop? I'd like to cease now before I mess up. (I mean an accidental death would be great and all, but not like this)",1

"Didn't Know I Had It In MeI spent about twelve consecutive hours today thinking about suicide.  Its been on my mind a lot lately.  I'm not posting here for attention or because I'm looking for someone to convince me that life gets/has purpose/whatever.

Even though I feel I have no reason to wake up in the morning, I do.  Every morning.  I'm afraid of death... rather, I'm afraid of the associated pain.  I've done research.  I know my options quite well; hell, I have favorites.  It's not like I haven't been here before.  I don't think I quite ever truly recovered when I got here the first time.  I didn't succeed when I first attempted suicide, but that's because it was a half-assed attempt.

I was afraid, and I didn't really know if it was what I wanted.  I'm... I'm getting more sure of it now.  Still, taking your own life... that's a ballsy thing.  It takes... it takes something.

So, today I cut for the second time.  Self-harm has never really been my thing, but it's progress.  The first time I cut, I pussied out a bit of that too.  This time I was a little more bold, and it didn't hurt as bad as I thought.  I felt... proud.  Maybe someday I could actually do it.

Like I said, this isn't because I'm looking for a ""friend"" or someone to talk me down.  I've realized that friends don't really exist in this world.  That's fine, because I don't really want to exist in this world either.  I can't really blame the concept of friends for not wanting to be here.  This is because I'm proud of my progress, and I wanted to proclaim it.",1

"Closet SuicidalI’ve been suicidal on and off throughout my life. I’m one of those smiley depressed/suicidal types so not even my partner of 12+ years really knows. He’d probably be completely shocked. I’m successful professionally, have a great personality (not very look-at-me but generally pretty social and quick to laugh), etc.

The last time I really outwardly struggled was when I was a teenager. In my early twenties, I became severely depressed and suicidal, but we were too young and drunk for him to really know what was going on other than thinking I was really lazy and messy all the time. After that, I was always able to be depressed and suicidal almost exclusively inwardly and without many outward symptoms.

We’ve had a baby who just turned a year, and honestly I think I’m the lowest I’ve ever been in my adult life. It’s starting to show, but mostly as new-mom-frustration, not depression. My husband mostly just finds me annoying when I’m like this.

I tried going to therapy the other week, but I mostly smiled the whole time and made light of everything. I didn’t even tell her I was depressed or suicidal. I just talked about all the stressors in my life and she actually complemented me on how together I was despite it all (I’ve got a lot of family drama going on right now that I won’t get into).

I just can’t get myself to admit feelings anymore, not even to myself. Honestly its sometimes difficult to feel my own feelings. I think I’ve numbed them out a lot over the years.

When I do feel, I just think about suicide and how I should have just done it before I had my daughter because of the traumatic effect suicide has on children. I will never tell her about my suicidal thoughts because my mom was constantly talking about suicide when I was a little kid. To this day, whenever she gets upset she talks about not wanting to live because I’ve done this or that. I never want to do that to my daughter.

Not that I would ever tell anyone outside of anonymity, but I almost regret having my daughter because now I can’t kill myself anymore.

I just wish I could get myself to talk to someone. I feel very alone. Today I just really wish I could end it but I could never leave my daughter to be raised by whoever while my husband has to work all the time.",1

"All the sameHey,
don't know why i write this but i guess it's hard to keep all it in for so long. I think my first depressive episode happened when I went to high school (16 yo). Since then I've been struggling with a sense of emptiness, meaninglessness of life, suicidal thoughts and suicide ideation. Every day I've been waking up hoping to die and never planned anything for the future as I've always thoughts that in no time I will finally kill myself. I've been numbing myself with alcohol getting blackout drunk almost every time I went out and eventually even my emotional reaction to suicidal thoughts became numbed as they became familiar, I got used to them and decided that soon I will surely do it.  
I passed my high schools finals with good marks, went to college, recently resigned from it and know i feel more lost than ever, have no direction in life, feel a great void inside of me and feel extremely loneliness as despite being 21 I've never been in a relationship. I act as if I'm okay, barely anyone knows that I'm depressed and extremely disappointed with myself, I go to therapist but it's hard to talk with her openly as i'm afraid of being locked in a hospital if I tell her what's going on.

"Search within yourselfI was down recently, shit was real bad, but I survived thanks to my amazing friends, and  now I feel happier everyday. The reason? My friends didn't cheer me up directly, they helped me ask myself- what makes me depressed, is it my own weakness or is it a past experience or is it someone/something else completely, what drives me forward, what have I lost, what can I recover and what can I gain. And they gave me no answers, they just gave me time and space, lots of it, to search the answers myself. 

In my case, it was my own weakness and I work on it, bit by bit, everyday. I accomplish something new, I make my friends laugh, I handle my duties and my passions well, and after an unbelievably long while I sleep waiting for the next day.

I can't say, I'm completely out of this, but my want to end it all has shrunk down a lot. Was it easy/quick? Heck no, it might be longer/shorter for you, but the important thing is, most of the answers lie right within you. So go on, talk about it. Talk to yourself, your friends, your parent, your partner, your pet, talk to me if you want to anyone you're comfortable with for that matter, but find it.

They all made me believe such crap. I was better off when I knew that I was a stupid loser. When I believed that things never change. If I kept being like that, I would have avoided so much disappointment.

I have two or three years at most, don't I? After that, there's really no chance to do anything. But right now I don't want to change or try. There's too little time left. How do you just start being a different person? I have no friends and no one likes me. I don't get laid. I don't have any money, and I can't get a job. At least not in Belgrade and getting one in my hometown means nothing. I haven't got a car and there's no buses and I don't know anyone really. They know me however, and they hate me.

There really is nothing I can do. Sorry I wrote all this garbage. Ignore it.

"I want to do it, but I am terrified of the prospect of oblivionI am 16 years old. Last year I realised that I had been seriously considering suicide. I talked to my mother about this. I went to 2 therapy sessions before they stopped, I dont know why they stopped, they just did. I have not talked to my mom about it since because she is sort of an emotional wreck, I guess and it was very hard on her the first time (she has a history of basically snapping and going completely apeshit at the smallest thing). Asking my dad is basically impossible. He is not a bad father, but we have never really been close or really talked much and I dont really think he would know what to do. So I guess im turning to this. The reason why I began to feel this way is primarily loneliness and a feeling that I was basically wasting my life. I am just impossibly shy. I havent really had real friends since about 2005? I mostly hang around with a bunch of nerds. I hate to say it but they are not nice people, they are all bitter, racist, sexist and extremely insecure, they often gang up on me and insult me. The reason I hang out with them is simply that they are the only people I have at school (School being my only social connection). Romance is basically something I have never even thought about, it just seems too unrealistic that it would ever involve me. Years ago when I still knew girls, there was one girl I liked. But I simply could never really tell her, because I was too scared, and now shes gone. I have absolutely 0 self confidence, mainly due to how much I suck at life it seems. I never properly learned how to communicate. I spend most of my early life (1-7) with a childminder who didnt really talk to me, just used to leave me in the living room so I got used to being alone. Primary school was better, I had a few friends and it was normal. Secondary school was just too big, and I didnt know anyone. So I just sort of gave up and didnt really make any friends.

Honestly I sometimes feel that I should just kill myself, like it could be the right thing to do, maybe I am just so inferior to everyone else, I should just go? Often when people talk about this, they talk about clubs activities etc, but I just, cant do this basically, I tried to make myself do it, im so scared of people. I got invited to a concert by two old friends of mine, with girls, alchohol everything etc. I knew at the time it would be a great oppurtunity, and it would probably be the only one. I considered it, but realised I just couldnt, I dont know how to. Its easier said than done. My life now basically consists of studying, maybe 1 hour of video games a day and then going to bed, I cant handle it anymore because im so goddamn bored. I have so little energy my grades started dropping from As to Cs, I got rejected by the 6th form I wanted to go to and I now face staying where I am, with the same godawful people, I feel trapped with my life, I lack the energy, social skills, and motivation to even go outside, I do not know how to get these things anymore. I realise this has become tldr. I am going to stop now.

The main thing really keeping me from doing it is that I am terrified of there being nothing after I died. I dont want oblivion, and my mom would probably die. If it werent for that, I would have done it. But im not sure when it will get so bad i will have no choice

"becoming a black holeI have been depressed for 15 years (25 in October) i still don't know what: and of course my doctors don't know why either. i am taking prescription antidepressamts, but i feel more and more suicidal every day.

"I would never kill myself, but I have suicidal thoughts constantly. How do I make them stop?The woman I'm in Love with left me almost 5 months ago now...and I'm still extremely messed up over it. Most of the time I can fake being fine well enough that I believe it myself, but some days I just can't do anything. 

I have a few things that make me feel better, but almost regardless of how I feel I see ways I could kill myself constantly and it's always something burning away in the back of my mind. On bad days sometimes as the train I take to class approaches I find myself imagining how easy it would be to just take a big step forward and be done with dealing with everything, on a very bad day sometimes I see it happen in my head very vividly. 

But as much as I feel ignored by people around me I also think of the people who would miss me and the fact that even though some things are really shitty right now I have good things going for me...I don't think I would ever actually be able to do it thanks to that.

But I still have these thoughts all the time and it scares me. Does anyone have any advice to help stop this?",1

"no hope left but too scared to dieIn just a few short months of bipolar mania and psychosis, I ruined everything I had going for me by losing my job and making every stereotypical bipolar mistake on a catastrophic and public scale. I won't recount the details because in my case mania wasn't euphoric or funny at all. The things I damaged can't be fixed, and on some level I just can't believe it all really happened. After three months on medication and back to my senses, my depression is getting worse instead of better because my problems are now all too real (primarily financial, in addition to remorse and shock over the horrible things I did). The worst part is that my family still harbors hope for me, not understanding how badly I actually destroyed my life prospects. In a way, their love and optimism is just more torment because it makes it harder to just kill myself, which seems like the rational choice. The only things that will realistically happen in my life now are negative, so it's the worst kind of suspense. What if things are actually, truly hopeless? That happens sometimes, doesn't it? Am I supposed to just endure it as the aftermath continues to unfold?",1

"The mods are cowardsI posted on r/depression and got perma banned for being truthful. Just after that I got perma banned from r/suicidewatch without any reason or explanation.  


My post was about having off and on thoughts of suicide, and my GF leaving me with our baby. I'm pretty sure that nothing in that post broke any of the rules. What I think happened is that a mod here is also a mod there, and decided to ban me for breaking a rule that was not clear in the first place.  


More importantly: I personally believe that these subs should enforce rules more forgivingly than other subs. These are specifically for people going through the toughest mental issues a human can go through. We are going to act out, lash out, act insane. We need a calm warning before being banned. Because every person posting here has mental issues that can be exacerbated by being downvoted or banned.  


Yes, you cowardly mods, banning someone may end their life. I tried to hang myself last night because of being banned. But the stupid cable was too weak and broke before I died. I woke up crying that the stupid cable failed.

It sucks a lot, I don't know if you do, but I beat myself over the idea that I'm sad as shit when I have everything I could want or need. I feel like a bitch. The thing is, I kinda hope I'll get better, though I want to die a lot, and I've tried a few times, I'm still breathing.

I feel like there are things I would regret as I started to lose consciousness.

So that's why I'm sitting in hospital right now, by my own choice, voluntarily. Because I know it's better to be here before anything happened than to get dragged down by the ambulance.

"Roughly 18 hours to go.Hey all, I didnt make my own post at start but I'm still set on ending it tomorrow. 

I've had people reach out with information on services or advice, I really do appreciate it, but I just cant do homeless again. It's not even that, I've had a stagnation cycle for years, I get or attempt momentum and it goes south or doesn't start. I dont mean to sound ""like a victim"".


Back in day if I bugged a place, eventually they'd see I want to be there more than their current employees and hire me. I have been bugging everywhere, for at least 3 weeks, going in face to face. Roughly 75% have more or less told me to stop coming in, in nice, vague words of course.

I hate how seemingly anytime I try ""the right way"" it just sets me up worse in life. Rather than just ""being a homeless person living day to day"" with my 3 days on streets, 1 day in hotel I did this 3 weeks and job hunt thing (SSI came Nov 29th).Rinse repeat each month w my SSI. Living just to live with no prospects is numbingly depressing. 


I dont do drugs or drink, so being homeless is extremely boring, which means my thoughts, anxiety and ruminations snowball as I go days without sleep. 


All week, once I realized temp agencies had no jobs w/o STBoots and that I was back on streets Thursday I've had this numb acceptance.  The thought of killing myself tomorrow isnt terrifying, saddening or even instilling apprehension. Now, if I think about being alive &amp; homeless again- my heart races, I sweat, I fidget, I want to cry until there's no moisture left. 

I was going to end it here, but hotel staff has been very nice. Worked with me regarding $ or even let me pay later a few times, I dont want their place to make the news (the arrogance of me. Impeachment and I think an aspies suicide will make a mention).",1
"No one will ever want me.I don't want to get into all the details, but someone I was friends with for years and had strong feelings for asked me out on a date, then rejected me the next day.

He made me feel so wonderful... He held me. Kissed me. Made love to me. Told me I was beautiful. He was perfect. And now he's ""not ready,"" he's ""overwhelmed,"" he ""doesn't want to hurt me..."" I'm so fucking angry and hurt. If he wasn't ready, why did he lead me on? Why did he let me fall in love? 

Every time I've loved someone, they've thrown me away. I guess I shouldn't be surprised. But this... This is just beyond heartwrenching. He knew I loved him. And he broke my heart. I want to cry so badly. But I can't. I just can't. I'm so numb, so emotionally scarred.

I've lost hope in finding a life partner. I know I don't need one. But dammit it hurts knowing that no one wants to spend their life with me. This hurt is so overwhelming, all-consuming. I can't eat. I can't sleep. I'm nauseous all the time. I want to celebrate a year clean from self-harm, but I can't. I'm in too much pain to be in a celebratory mood. I'm in agony unlike anything I've ever experienced.

I do not want to hurt those around me. But I just can't take it. It hurts too much. The anxiety, the uncertainty, is all just too much. I wish I had marijuana, opiates, something to kill the pain, at least for a moment. Something to keep me from ending my existence...",1

"Can't shake thisWhen I look back on my life, I just see mediocrity, underachievement, and failure. No great paying career, no real success in music, which throughout my 20s I focused a lot of time and energy on, and no real useful skills or profound knowledge. This is how I view myself. Everyday I ask, ""What is this life?""

I was with a woman for five years. We were engaged, then it all fell apart the last couple years. We tried couples counseling, I went to therapy, she also went to therapy, we tried recreational drugs, bla bla bla, but everything worked no better than a temporary Band-Aid. Nothing seemed to mend our differences, and she ended up leaving anyway. She took a lot of the valuables, and the dogs. And within two weeks, she was with another man. 5 years together, and she got over it in two weeks? I'm pretty sure she cheated on me, despite her telling me she loved me always and all these other lies. Honestly, it's better that she's gone, as I've had months and months to reflect now, though her jumping into another relationship immediately after doesn't make me feel all that great about myself.

Anyway, the worst part is the dogs being gone. I raised those dogs and did everything for them, and I got nothing. Now I'm all alone, under stay-at-home orders, $52K in debt (not including student loans), about to file for bankruptcy, and wondering if she'll ever pay me the $10k she owes me (probably not) or take initiative to get my name off the title of her car, while her new man drives it around with MY dogs... Being alone is not helpful because I just think about everything that happened and it makes me angry. One of the worst things about our breakup is the rift it created between me and our mutual friends. Now, nobody wants to hang out or talk to me. Nobody asked for my side of the story during all this - they never cared to. And I'm not about to go tell everyone around town what happened or post about it on social media. That is not my style. So, I just rolled with the punches until I'm where I'm at now. Forgotten and alone.

I used to get really driven with music and write tons of songs, play with friends, play shows, hell maybe even a little tour here and there, but the last half year+ has been pretty much a dry spell. Then I get mad at myself for being so depressed, because I can't write songs. Then I start thinking about the point of it all, as often it seems like a huge waste of time. I feel like I'm losing my life by doing nothing with music, but I also simultaneously don't feel the same joy I used to feel when doing it. Then I think, ""Well if you stop making music, what else are you gonna do?"" That's one of the best things I can do, and I'm not even that great at it.

So what's left? I'm trying to study to get A+ certs to get into IT, but that too brings on a feeling of, ""What's the point?"" Yea, more money, but for what? I have no goals and don't know where to start to make new ones. Right now, I just want this constant feeling of lethargy, apathy, and depression to end so I can at least occupy my time with something else.

I'm just so sick of this. I feel like I've fucked up my life not only because of everything that happened the last 5 some years, but because of a slew of other shitty decisions that I've made over time. I feel like my family thinks I'm a fuck up, and that I let them down, and I often believe them. By comparison, my sister is a Doctor, and I'm just a loser with a boring job and an ability to play bass and guitar. Wooo... Totally giving back to society over here...

I often think about suicide as the ultimate escape from this hell. I need to break this cycle and I don't know if I have the ability to do it myself. I stopped doing drugs, don't smoke, try to work out, eat great, but it isn't enough it seems. I'm either missing something, or my brain is now hardwired for the constant negativity beat-down, and I don't know how much more I can take.

Sorry for the long post. I don't really talk to anyone about this so, here it is. Depressed, lost, and alone.",1

Please help. The world is going to shit. I walk through the halls of my school and the people can laugh and complain about their stupid petty problems. They don’t understand the dangers around them. They don’t get that nothing matters. We’re all going to die in a few years any way. They don’t get it. They act like idiots for “popularity”. It pisses me off how people can be so care free. So stupid and ignorant. I want to believe there are good people but people around me squash that idea into dust. There are people that I like but they don’t get it either. My best friend is an idiot. He doesn’t understand. I know that sounds horrible to say. I’m not a good person either. I try to be. I want to be. But I have thoughts of doing horrible things to people. I’m plagued by the thought of having total sexual control of someone. I can’t get them out. Sometimes I just want to destroy and kill. But I can’t. I won’t. I hate that I can give others advice and give them hope but that advice is meaningless to me. I don’t follow it. I say I have reasons to live but I don’t. I would be fine dying, disappearing. A while back I tried to talk someone down. I told them how their method was slow and painful and they thanked me. I’m scared. I’m tired. I’m paranoid. I want to cry but I cant. I hate the idiotic feminist ideals. Fucking man-spreading bullshit. I hate it. It pisses me off to no end to see people complain about petty problems in front of them when they can’t turn around and see the looming problem about to kill them. I want to help. I want to do something meaningful. But when you have your spirit, your hope, your happiness crushed by people it hurts. I want to live up to peoples expectations but I won’t. I’ll be a failure after all the encouragement I got. I’ll disappoint my family. I’ll just end up cold and alone hanging with a rope around my neck. At least then I won’t be able to feel the cold. I won’t have to shiver in the darkness. I can float. Dark. Not feeling, not aching, not alive. I don’t know when. I don’t know how, but I hope I can rid this miserable life soon. I want to sleep. It wouldn’t matter, the world is dying while we sit on our shitty devices and distract ourselves. While greedy people turn a blind eye and continue making  millions of useless prices nylon and paper. I’m a shitty person. I get mad. I want to have control over women. I want to kill people. I want to destroy everything. I want to destroy humanity. So one day I could watch the stars. The galaxy. Did I you know without light pollution we would be able to see the galaxy. I’m sure it beautiful. But I will never get to see it. Just another great thing the “wonders” of technology have brought us. I want to die. I’m so broken. The only reason I’m really making this post is to get sympathy. Im begging for attention. I’m going to die. Alone. Cold. A disappointment. A virgin. An idiot.

They of course freak the fuck out and started hitting me and the dog while his knot was still stuck in me. After I heard my parents talking to my uncle who was suggesting an exorcism be performed on me. They decided to send me for a psychological assessment instead. So I went to the doctor and tell him that I have always been into animals and how it's not fair that society puts unnecessary constraints on who we can show love and affection to. It's okay for a interracial homosexual couple to legally pee on each other but not okay to have a dog shove his dick up my ass? Anyways the doctor diagnosed me with ASD or something like that. As this was happening my parents put killed my lover as they said he was now ""tainted"". When I found out I went to bed crying and woke up crying. And to put the cherry on the fucking top my little bitch of a sister told everyone in my school about this. I'm so depressed and alone now I skip school and go under a bridge cry, contemplate my own death and throw rocks at stray cats. I think I'm going to go out through hypothermia, I heard the last moments are absolutely euphoric.

"Every day suicidal thoughtsEvery day I think about killing myself. I'll be going about my every day life and walk over a bridge and imagine jumping off, I'll be waiting for a train and imagine being in front of it as it hurtles past. I sit at home and I think about all the ways i could do it and it frustrates me that I can't choose when to die because my loved ones would view it so badly. 
So, every day I'm alone with my thoughts, my fantasies. I have no plan to actually do it and it has become so normal to think of death that it's weird to think of not killing myself.",1

"I think my BF triggers suicidal ideation.I would never tell him this because I don’t want come off as manipulative but I’m starting to admit my BF is one of my major triggers for suicidal thoughts. He treats me like a fucking peasant. He constantly mentions my lack of money or the shitty financial situation I was in a year ago with my mother.

According to him I’m too poor for his stuck-up friends. I know all his friends think they’re better than me and he does too. I’m too poor for a normal engagement and wedding. I’m too poor to be trusted without a prenup. 

It causes me so much anxiety about money, I even started gambling which I detest. And it’s not like I’m not trying, I forced a fucking raise out my boss. I make enough to not even need him. Then he wonders why I talk about offing myself 24/7. It’s clear I’m a financial burden and I’ll never not be to him. ",1

THIS is something I have to remind myself.
I have posted here before and I got great advice but i feel maybe I didn't address the correct issue. 
Not being alive has just been seeming enticing. 
I do not like work or school, (never have liked school). I know nothing about anything other than usless material like video games and magic the gathering. and i know that ky family loves me but religion really esqued my thinking. (how can you know what love is when it's something you MUST grant everyone?) I let religion control me and now without it. I do not know who i am. I have tried to discover to no avail.

"I'd rather end my suffering than wait for things to get better when I know they won'tI've already picked out a date before the year ends and I actually feel very at peace with my decision, as well as relief knowing that I won't be tortured with horrible depression every single day. I've suffered from horrible depression since I was 13, therapy and drugs never helped me at all, and now I'm at a point where I can't even afford it anyways. My family doesn't want to have anything to do with me, all of my old friends have moved away or have new lives and have cut off contact. the only good thing I had was a relationship that ended a couple months ago, and the breakup really fucked me up mentally, and I know I will never feel better. I know no one else will want to date or associate with me and I'm just done with trying. My life doesn't have a meaning and there is really no other reason for me to be here. I just waste people's time and resources and take up space. For once in my life I actually feel at peace knowing that I'm in control of ending my own suffering.",1

Truthfully I don’t even know if I wanted to do it or not. 
I just know that in that moment I wanted to do something. 

I know all the bullshit about how I just want out of the bad situation and that suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem but there is literally no bad situation. No fucking problem. NONE. I am perfectly fine. I don’t even want to fucking die half the time, Im too fucking scared.

Family, Friends have taken me for granted and left me hanging. I just need a fresh start on my personal life. I am way behind the curve and I'm not sure I'll make it out alive on my career end to see positive changes in my personal life (family and friend relationships) from my recent years of depression. I can't remember the last time I was content with life. I wish some friends would remember me and reach out as a genuine caring friend because I never had that type of family support. I try reaching out and still get blown off. I feel alone in this battle. Not suicidal, but just depressed at life. These are supposedly my best years and yet I am chained to my mother for life it seems. I don't have a life of my own. I just go with the motions. Only thing going for me is this job.

She told me that I was bad for her and the she wanted to be away from me. When I heard that I couldn’t bear it anymore. All of the pain of cutting her off and being alone has pushed me to the edge, and now her saying this is too much for me to handle. I feel utterly finished. Every birthday feels worse and worse, and I can’t bear this any longer. I don’t want to say goodbye to my friends or family because I don’t want them to stop me. I’ve tried therapy and I’ve been on medication for a while. Without her I feel empty, and with her saying I’m bad for her I don’t know what I am anymore.  So now I give up. I’ve been trying to get better and I’m just not, all my effort feels worthless. I’m sorry everyone.",1

"My friend commited suicide this week and made me want to do the same.I'll make this short, because I'm so exhausted of thinking tonight, perhaps I'll elaborate tomorrow.

I've been suicidal for two years, made two half-assed attempts with pills and alcohol, and been hospitalised a few times. Before this, I was a happy, quite resourceful and hard working girl. 

A few days ago, a friend of mine ended her life. I wasn't close to her but we are a very big group of friends now mourning and of course the big talking topic is suicide. Huge. Trigger. They are saying extremely offensive things which of course is because they don't understand what it it like to be suicidal.

I was doing quite well before this happened, I've stayed out of hospitals since November. Got a puppy, changed my job. 

and here I am, reading and obsessing over suicide methods and survival stories. I feel trapped, because I can't do this right after our other friend. Which they also remind be of every day.

I feel trapped, extremely alone and very triggered.",1

"Anyone else realize how messed up Timmy Turnerâ€™s life was? Looking back, this is quite possibly the saddest show Iâ€™ve ever watched. 

His parents were either gone, or not liking him. I.e. their distrust in him when he says Vicky is rude to him. They also regularly make jokes about how much they dislike having had him. His only teacher quite literally was insane. Not only that, this teacher had a profound disliking for Timmy. Heâ€™s also bullied in school, both by his â€œfriendsâ€ and the person the show actually identifies as a bully. Lastly, the person who does take care of him most of the time, Vicky, is quite possibly a psychopath. 

It gets to the point where he creates a construct in his mind that he has fairies. These fairies can solve every problem Timmy has, itâ€™s everything Timmy has ever *dreamed* of. Sometimes things get so bad, they take him to another world (that fairy world thing) They quite literally blind him from his dark reality, as they bring him to another dimension, make him a superhero, get rid of his bullies, give him a girlfriend, all the things he could *imagine* they brought to him. 

Did you ever think that maybe the reason he canâ€™t show Cosmo and Wanda to other people, isnâ€™t because they would be taken away, but because they donâ€™t exist? Think about it, his parents, his teacher, everyone constantly gives him weird looks, treats him like heâ€™s lost it, treats him like heâ€™s a â€œnot all thereâ€ 5 year old. Maybe the reason the teacher hates fairies so much, isnâ€™t because he just doesnâ€™t like them, but because the â€œfairiesâ€ Timmy is always talking to are the sole reason he doesnâ€™t try in school. 

Toward the end of the show, his parents get him a dog. Now, if youâ€™re the parent to a 13 year old youâ€™re not just going to give them a dog that they need to take care of all on their own. Youâ€™d only get them a dog if the child ABSOLUTELY needs it. In Timmyâ€™s case, the dog is likely just a therapy dog, who the parents got for Timmy thinking it could help him return to reality. 

Iâ€™m never going to be able to watch another Fairly Oddparents episode again. I tried it earlier, I was literally crying 5 minutes in.",0

So when I was like 8 my school was doing a talent show and nobody in my class volunteered so my teacher made my friend do it and she got me and another friend to do it. We chose to sing under our spell from the mlp rainbow rocks movie (btw them girls watching them back have a weird tension about them), I was originally a backup singer but main girl couldn't handle the role so I took it and I sung my little heart out and we got to the finals but we lost to someone singing a Bruno mars song or something idk. I was sad we lost because I was 8 and I really just sung in front of hella people only to loose. ( didn't matter to me because the prize was a tennis racket and a ball from Poundland) oh well, now I've remembered this I have a massive flex on people because I went and did that.

"National Suicide Prevention Hotline might just get you battered and left to walk home alone in the dark and rain. DON'T EVER CALL 1 800 273 8255
I called the hotline because I felt like I might hurt myself a couple of days before Christmas. The line was disconnected because my cell phone went dead. I'm sorry so I put it on the charger and started it back up when I had a little bit of power I saw I had a message from them asking me to contact them or they would send someone to check on me so I contacted them right away and let them know I was okay and that I was no longer feeling like I might hurt myself. A couple of hours later a police officer showed up at my door I opened the door and asked him what he needed and he said that he understood I was feeling like I might hurt myself and I assured him I no longer felt that way and that I had called the hotline back and told them so and I close the door. As I close the door he stuck his foot in the door but I had already got the door closed. Apparently this made him very angry and he began to beat on the door so I opened the door back up immediately, at which point he grabbed my arm very brutally and said he did not believe that I was okay. He asked why I called in the first place and why I was upset and felt like I might hurt myself and so I explained to him it was related to some texts and voicemails I had received from my mother. I told him I would show them to him if he'd like and he said yes. So I went to get my cell phone and as I did he suddenly decided he didn't want me to get my phone?  He grabbed me again and put me in handcuffs, and called for backup? I told him I did not intend to fight him and I did not intend to hurt myself I could not understand why he was doing this to me but he just continued to brutalize me! By the time he was done I had a boot Mark in my shoulder oh, I had bruises on both arms bruises on both wrists and hands bruises on both legs and a cut on my right leg! I was forced to go to the hospital where they did not even treat me because they said there was nothing wrong with me? They just left me lying in a room until I finally got up and left😢 they had a telepsychiatrist evaluate me and she said she could completely understand why I was so upset in light of everything I was going through at the current time and they were going to get me some medication to help me with the anxiety but they did not! I was not offered a ride home I could not reach Uber because my phone would not work. I left there on foot in the dark and rain, and nobody cared! Not one person said one word of encouragement or concern?  They even stole my medicine I had a CBD cartridge in my pocket and was not given the opportunity to take it out since I was drugged out of my apartment against my will. It was a $70 cartridge and my medicine to last for the next 3 weeks. I was told it would be put into the security room for safekeeping until I left? But when I left and asked for it back I was told it was disposed of😢 And on top of all that $430 went missing out of my wallet while officer friendly was beating me up look at me up??????? No wonder he had such a giant smile on his face and kept laughing the whole time 😭😭😭😭 DON'T EVER CALL THE NATIONAL SUICIDE PREVENTION HOTLINE!!! They are not your friends and they DO NOT want to help you!!!  It's just a way for them to tell their friends and family they do something meaningful by volunteering for something that should be good but isn't!!!

She gave me the number of someone else to call until then!  I called it and got a recording saying call back another time. How f****** sad is that!!!

"I know that one day I am going to kill myself.Some days it feels closer than others, but I think it's at least a year or two out. This isn't to say it couldn't be tomorrow or that it couldn't be in five years. I only mean that I'm almost certain of it and it's how I *want* to die. I think I should be in control of when and how I die, you know, other than accidental death or murder. It's selfish, sure, but it's a personal choice that people make all the time and I want that choice for myself, too.  

 I find myself often thinking it would be okay if this car coming at me would suddenly swerve into my lane at 60 mph. It would be okay if I died in my sleep and never woke up. Dying will be okay. It's oblivion and I want it more and more all the time- more so than life or experience.  

I'm 31 years old, and while I know that I haven't seen everything, felt everything, been everywhere, or learned all there is to learn, I don't think it matters. When I'm dead none of this will matter and everything I do in life will be as if it never happened. 

My mother took her own life a little over two years ago. For a while I thought only of how selfish she was- and it burned a scar into my heart that will never fully heal. But I want to tell her that I get it, even though I don't think she knew what she was doing when she killed herself. She was fucked up on drugs and essentially trying to avoid going back to prison. I sometimes think she didn't mean to be successful and hoped it would win her sympathy, as she had done that once years before.   

When she succeeded and I found out, it took my thinking into new territory that I didn't know existed: We're all going to die. All my life I think I never really believed it- a youth being a youth- but suddenly it was real and it took my mother.  
  
 She gave herself to it. And she's gone and I can never talk to her again. I can never ask why or did she, oops, not really mean to? I want to tell her that she pulled the rug out from under us right before I was going to do it. I want to tell her that I've put the rug back but I'm still thinking about it almost every moment of every day. 

Those left of my family, my brother and sister and my dad and step-mom, my grandmothers, and very few friends- I can't talk to them about this. I can't get their *permission*, and I know they would never be okay with it. In fact, it would probably piss most people off. So it's my secret and I keep it. Except here right now because I fucking want to tell someone anonymous.  

I know how much it is going to hurt certain people. The only reason I really haven't yet is because of them, but I know I can't keep this up.
 I'm going to kill myself. I really doubt I could be talked out of it. I've read and enjoyed some of the most uplifting shit in the world, and the most negative shit doesn't make me feel hopeless. It's not that I feel depressed or hopeless anyway. It's just that I'm tired of life. I'm tired of waking up every day. I'm tired of the grind. I make music and I paint and I write and none of it matters because ultimately everything will be gone. I work to pay bills that I would rather laugh at. I eat because I have to, not because I want to. Life is inherently pointless. I know that I've got to make my own happiness and give myself purpose. No one can or will do it for me.... and I don't want them to. I just want out.

Seriously life has no point for me. Why continue on living if i dont have anything to live for. What do i have? Hope? Even if i want things to change i cant. I cant influence other people to like me, either they do or they dont.

"Acquired means. Strong chance I'll attempt.I got pills earlier today. There is a very real chance that I might get to the point of using them in the next few days, especially if intoxicated. I haven't been this scared in a while.What should I do?",1
"Finding this living thing to not be so greatI really don't know what to do with myself or my life. I feel like I've exhausted my potential and focused on all the wrong things. As a result:

* I'm socially awkward. I can't have a real friendship with anyone. I wonder if there's something off about my body language of facial expressions. Even my own family doesn't seem to like me. You can imagine how well this goes over when talking to women or going on dates. I spend most of my time alone just surfing the Internet. The worst part is, despite all the advice I read, I have no idea how to implement it since it seems like my personality is beyond my control.

* I haven't spoken with the only real friends I've had since I was 14 (I met them near the end of college) in two years.

* I have literally no talents. Alright, I can cook pretty well with a recipe in front of me and I know a little Japanese, but beyond that, I have nothing. Since I have no real skills, I can't get a job beyond minimum wage work (despite going to college) or have something cool to show other people.

* I have nearly zero experience in life beyond studying in Japan for a semester in college. And I burn through those stories quickly and sound like a huge weeaboo if I talk about them too much. As a result, I usually have nothing interesting to talk about.

* I live at home and don't have a car. As a result, it's hard going anywhere to meet people. There is a bar near my home and the staff is friendly with me, but beyond that, it's still really hard starting conversations with people.

* I have no idea what to do with my life. Most days, I'm working at my cashier job or laying in bed surfing the Internet. I do go to the gym and jog almost everyday of the week, though (I rest on Sunday). On top of that, my student loans are piling up. I really hate to see my acrued interest right now. I just don't know what to do. I hate the idea of being committed to something for the rest of my life. But even if I had an idea what to do, see the section above about me not having any skills.

I just don't see the point in life. It seems everyone wants to work 9 to 5, get married, and have kids, but none of that appeals to me. I want to be free to go wherever I want; do whatever I want; fuck whoever I want to fuck. I don't want to be chained down by anything.

But that's the problem with this world; it wants you to be committed to something. It seems like the only way to be free is to completely ignore the law and fuck people over, and I don't want to do that. So, at this point, it seems like suicide is the best option.

I just hate the person I've become and how it's the exact opposite of anything I wanted to be. And how any effort I take to change it will take years. Why couldn't I have had the realizations I'm having now when I was younger? I could have actually had a life in high school and college, and worked harder to have a better future after I graduated.

I'm hoping you guys can pull through for me. I'm at the point where very little in life gives me any real joy. I've posted here before and haven't been too impressed with the commentary. Hopefully, this time around, there's something.

But I'm already pretty committed to dying at this point, so I don't know what anyone can say to change my outlook.",1

"I think I'm calling it quitsI can't get better no matter how hard I try. I thought things were going better with my ex wife. I thought we were getting back together. It's been months of us hanging out almost daily and having a lot of fun. But now she's officially with someone else. I'm barely succeeding in college, trying to finally pursue my dream, and it's so hard.  My anxiety basically prevents me from going outside of my apartment unless I'm with her. Now I have a new deadend job at a day food restaurant that starts tomorrow. I need the job because the disability insurance I get for my depression, anxiety, and ptsd is barely enough to live off of, so I need some supplemental cash. But because of the anxiety and stress over having to go to work tomorrow, I can't sleep. So I'm stressing and smoking about that. It bothers me so much that the only time I was ever successful at anything was while in the military. Literally blowing people up. I'm an absolute piece of unlovable garbage and I've wanted to kill myself since as far back as I can remember. 

I've decided. I'm leaving it in the hands of the American people. 
4 more years of Trump and our terrifying descent into fascism is, honestly, the least of my concerns, but I've decided to make it my ultimatum. If Trump wins, I'm killing myself.

"Relapsing, past issues are still hereI feel ashamed of my mental health issues. I started struggling at 15 years old, with social anxiety, self harm, depressive episodes, suicidal thoughts and ideation...never talked about my problems, my family still doesnt know.  Now I'm 22, still struggle with social anxiety but its better...but I feel ashamed bc I'm self harming again, I self harmed 2 weeks ago, I got angry with my father that always criticize me. I also feel depressed again, I'm studying at university but I doubt myself a lot. How can I find jobs with social anxiety? I still struggle when I talk with others. I feel lost, I think about suicide, I'm afraid I'll kill myself if I don't find my path, my purpose. I wanted a job where I could help people, I did 3 years at university for this and I really wanted to and still want to help! But how can I help if I'm struggling? 

I feel like a burden...I'm wasting my parents money. If I kill myself they don't have to waste money for me anymore. Tomorrow I'll call a new therapist I really need one!...I'm ashamed because I'm relapsing with everything. But I'm afraid I'll start therapy and don't get better then what?﻿",1

I am seeking inspiration for my own life, and would like to hear your thoughts on this. Also, does anyone have any suggestions for what one could do during an acute suicidal crisis? Something to think about maybe? I have heard ""call a hotline"", ""talk to someone you trust"", and ""distance thoughts from actions/wait 24 hours"" many times. Thanks.",1
"Does therapy help with suicidal thoughts?My mother has been having suicidal thoughts for at least the past 11 years. I'm hoping the thoughts are on and off, but I guess I would not really know because she doesn't talk about the thoughts everyday. There are 4 of us children; I am the oldest. My sister (second oldest one) and I were very shaken by her first three suicide threats when we were kids, but after the three times we got desensitized and stopped taking her threats as seriously after  that, except once or twice after that when it felt more serious. I never knew that she was actually close to taking her own life until a few days ago. In the aftermath of a small fight when she got really angry, she said that she can't take it and just wants to jump. Then for the first time, she told me that she had actually opened window grills or a rooftop door, and contemplated jumping before stopping herself. I started crying sometime in this conversation and she kept talking with a nonchalant and amused expression. She said that life and death was natural and asked why I was crying with an amused expression. I replied that taking her life is not natural, and that talking about her own suicide to someone that loved her and expecting them to not cry is not natural. She said that she plans to do it when all her kids are older and independent. My youngest sibling is 11, so I'm guessing that's at least another 5-7 years. She also said that she's already told my father. They love each other very much and have a good relationship. In her religion, there is a heavy punishment for suicide, and she says that one day when she is courageous enough to face that punishment, she will go. How do I go about preventing a suicide that far ahead in the future? Would therapy actually help? I live in a country with good access to mental health specialists, and I trust that we would be able to find a good therapist eventually and might even be able to get subsidized rates. But my biggest worry is that my mother will pay lip service to the therapist for these 5-7 years and tell us that she is getting better, and one day when we aren't paying attention she would just take her own life. Is there anything that can actually help? ",1

"Ranting for myself I guessI can't ever do what I like. I know that I guess. I'll never get any opportunities in theatre anymore because of my bull shit asshole filled highschool theatre program. I don't think I'm great alright? But I used to know I was good. I'm trained in dance, vocal, acting, and I came from an arts school. But they all treat me like shit. I fucking hate them. I never tell them that of course though. I just have dreams all the time about finally being in a production again, then I wake up and it's all gone. Everything is gone. I'll never have it again. I'll never get to work with people and entertain the audience. I'm apparently good enough to be exploited for solos but I can't have even an ensemble part in a fucking show. I have tons of experience. I'm suicidal. I'm depressed. I'm anxious. I go for weeks without sleep on end. The only thing I still like, out of music, guitar, violin, piano, singing, etc is theatre. That's all I want. Musical theatre. That's why I moved here. I've been nice to all of those shit heads. They're all mean to me. They always have been. It's been years. No one understands how much I miss entertaining everyone on stage. But I can never have it again. Every community theatre is some how fucking attached to people at that damn school. I've auditioned a million times for everything. The theatre class at school was terrible to me. I'm fine with critiques y'know, or I wouldn't enjoy theatre. But the top kids in the class ridiculed me daily and the teacher supported it. This is my LIFE. This is everything to me.  My parents are emotionally abusive and treat me terribly all the time. I can't get a job because I have scoliosis and most minimum wage jobs require bending. I can barely drive because of my back. My parents took away my lessons with my favorite teacher, whose like a father to me, and keep refusing to give them back. I feel like I make my boyfriend buy things constantly like food. I hate it when people spend money on me.  Everyday gets worse and worse. It hurts so badly that I am honestly suprised I haven't just stopped existing. My biological mom (who did drugs, is a pathological liar, used to be alcoholic, lied to government) won't leave me alone online. I can't see my little sister because she lives with her and my biological mom is crazy and just tells me off for ridiculous things. (Ex used to tell me we're witches and princesses when i was younger. Also, went off on me extensively for not giving her professional physical copy prom pictures while I was still at prom and she lives cities away. Also I'm broke we didn't take any, nor can I teleport.) I just feel so freaking bad. Sorry for the wall of text. Sorry for everything honestly. Sorry I'm not hanging or bleeding out. ",1
"I wonder why do I even need to exist?I’m 31. I’m a gay man who was born in a broken family. My father put his last name on me and left us after a week. 
At 3 years old I had an accident trying to climb on the kitchen and busted my head causing me a mild brain injury that would be the root of my undiagnosed ADHD and severe anxiety issues. 
I was raised in a very hostile environment where my mom retaliated all her anger and frustrations beating the crap out of me all the time. My grandma who was the light of my childhood had a seizure when I was 8 years old and ended up crippled in a wheelchair until she died 11 years later. She turned into the biggest and most annoying burden a small family can endure. 
My mom was obsessed with the idea that no matter the cost I had to be in a privileged private school even when I was bullied for being different in so many ways. I was made fun of out of everything. My height (I’m also 5,6), my sudden queer manners, my clumsiness...etc...I even developed severe dermatillomania in my hands due to severe anxiety. it was hell, I had 2 attempts for suicide that were totally ignored by everyone like it didn’t really matter. The only friend close friend that I had only lasted a year and half after his mom passed away in the middle of his first year in the school... 
I was the poorest of my classroom, I had the worst house, my mom drove the cheapest car and even my dogs were ugly as fuck. Neighbors would always made fun of my pets. 
My house, disgusting, always dirty...my mom was a semi hoarder and would always accumulate clothes and books. 
I would never invite anybody out of deep shame. 
My grades in school were ok. 
I was very good in some and horrible in the others. I had to spend extra hours memorizing stuff because I would not understand simple shit sometimes. Every time I had to speak in public I would panic and stutter and people would laugh. 
My scape was video games, I would play so much that because of it, it started affecting my visual impairment and started developing strabismus at 15 years old....
After I graduated, i got out of my hometown and got to a private university paid by my mom. 
I struggled a lot in college. 
I felt stupid and out of place. I was always awkward and lacked social skills. 
I would annoy the fuck out of people and they would ignore me. 
In my time off I focused myself to try hard and be more physically attractive so I would go to the gym and have tons of protein supplements. 
I would also go to play Magic theGathering whenever I could and eventually got good at it but due to my undiagnosed ADHD I would mess up all the time. I would get so angry at losing. 
At 21 I lost my hair. I was balding bad since 18. 
I hated my look. I was always angry because I had to wear a hat to look like my age. I would look almost 10 years older. 
While in college, I started forcing myself in doing internships but I would be so difficult to work with due to my behavior and forgetfulness. 
On my last semesters I would try to work on the side but got fired twice. 
I gave up on my 8th semester and quit college for a year out of deep shame for myself. I felt humiliated constantly. 
To fix my visual impairment I managed to get a surgery in a public hospital after a 3 months wait. 
I “fixed it”...when back to college. Same struggles on other areas. Didn’t give up this time, suffered a lot to get that thesis done. My thesis barely passed...it was basic and shitty. 
I didn’t make any friends and even when i was invited by default to the college graduation party I barely knew anybody and it was awkward as fuck. 
After college. I started internships again (neither of the didn’t last long tbh). I would sugarcoat my resume to death to appeal to employers, I ended up being hired in a couple places but surprise, got fired in the first and the second was horrible an abusive position that nobody else would take and therefore ended up there for a year. I got so depressed I ended taking medication for depression and quit that job. I got hired in an ad agency which fired me after a month. 
I gave up on everything and  sold my MTG cards to buy my ticket to the US...
I tattooed my head in a micropigmentation style so it gave me a younger appearance and it somehow made me feel less shitty about my genetic makeup. 
I ended up as a server in multiple places. I worked as busser, server and even did cleaning labors. 

I would throw up in bathrooms out of panic, anger and shame. I got hospitalized in 2016 for severe depression...
I ended up working in a total of 15 places. In which I got fired in 9 of them. 
I got diagnosed of ADHD at 29. After being fired for like the 12th time for being messy, scattered minded and forgetful. After meds I saw the light. I started getting creative. It was like a miracle. 

Too bad I lost my 20’s and teens in a very miserable way. 

Even when in these 2 years of new life I’ve improved a lot, I still can’t get a job out of my lack of experience and creating a business takes a lot of investment that I haven’t been able to acquire. 
Social media makes me sick and gives me PTSD  every time I get to see the accomplishments of those people that I studied with and all their successful relationships. The amount of mental disorders I’ve gathered through so much abuse are way too much to handle and paying for a friend (therapy) hasn’t solved the issue. 
I now have CPTSD, Rejection sensitivity dysphoria and probably some mild form of autism. 

What is the point of all this suffering? 

I’ve gone against all odds...fought many battles. But in the end...it doesn’t even matter. 

Why do people like me exist? Is not like someone is going to give me a life medal for overcoming the gigantic struggles of my life. 

Nobody wants to date me because I’m so emotionally damaged. I’m in total fear of meeting new people and isolation made everything worse. I’m a couple months away of being possibly homeless and if I get to that  point it’s definitely over. 

Is life even worth all this shit?
I feel like it’s hanging from a thin string and it’s about to break anytime soon. 

I should’ve broken my neck when I was 3.",1
"I don't know what to do. I love you, please don't give up.One of the people I care the most for in life is depressed and suicidal and I'm so scared I'm not saying the right things. I'm fighting every fiber of my being to not be around that person, as they clearly want to be left alone, but it's so hard when I'm so sick with worry. My head tells me the right thing to do is let them come around in their own time and not pressure them, but my heart wants me to run to them. God, what am I supposed to do.",1
"I’m sorryI wish that I could have one day, where I felt worthy. Where I didn’t feel less than. And that voice of doubt wouldn’t try to convince that everyone would be better if I wasn’t here. Or that no one cares or loves me. I just want one day of peace and happiness. I would pay any amount of money to feel normal for just one day and not have this self hatred looming over me.
I have already written my good bye letter, and placed it where it can be found. I’m done. I wish that I was stronger, but I’m not",1
"I feel like I'm close to breakingI posted in depression some time ago, several weeks I think. Not sure. I said then, among other things, that I wasn't suicidal. Not really. Because it doesn't matter and nothing really does. But now despite my suffering being utterly irrelevant to anything at all in the grand scheme of things, I'm starting to feel like I want it to end sooner rather than later. I still don't think I would kill myself, but I'm not as certain as I used to be. I just...

Time erases all joy and sorrow, so it doesn't matter when I die. ""BuT aLl YoUr LoVeD oNeS wIlL bE sAd!"" And then they'll eventually die too so that doesn't matter either. Oh sure, it sounds horrible to say, and I'll be devastated when any more of my own friends or family die, but then I'll die eventually so that won't matter, won't have mattered. It sounds terrible but it's true. And helping other people doesn't matter because their joy will eventually wither as well.

""ThIs ToO sHaLl PaSs."" Yep it sure will and then SO WILL ANY HAPPINESS I FEEL IN THE FUTURE SO THAT DOESN'T FRIGGIN HELP EITHER!!! This saying is the worst possible thing I could ever hear!

""LoL a ThInG iSn'T bEaUtIfUl BeCaUsE iT lAsTs!"" Actually, it partially is though, because anything that didn't last isn't beautiful anymore.

""yOu HaVe To MaKe YoUr OwN mEaNiNg!"" There's no meaning to be made if nothing lasts forever, because it's going to be erased anyway. Everything will. But none of the religious views on the afterlife posited help in any way either. Oh we reincarnate? Doesn't help because we apparently lose all memories. Heaven or hell? An eternal afterlife based on our finite decisions. Gross. Atheism? Oh great, we all get made didn't happen by the void at the end of the universe, no practical difference between us having existed and never having existed at all.

I've heard all these things from people at some point or another, all are things from people who don't seem to have thought them through to the end. Or they seem like empty words people cling to to avoid thinking about the reality of the matter. 

And ultimately, I hate being human... I hate needing other people. I hate the fact that talking about this shit helps, just thinking about it doesn't, because apparently, no matter how intelligent I think I am, I'm too stupid to think along the right pathway to get past this. I hate how susceptible we are to gimmicky bullshit mind games. For example, did you know that people have lost weight just by switching the size of their plates? Because apparently we as a species are so incredibly idiotic that we think we're eating more food if our food is on a smaller plate. Ugh.  

I hate that so many people have told me I need to schedule my life. Scheduling is a self imposed rut that murders passion for the sake of efficiency and I hate it. 

I hate being a social animal. I hate the fact that we seem to be nothing more than slaves to each other with no masters. Everyone influences everyone, there's no real individuality or independence to be found, apparently. We're all just mirrors reflecting each other, there's even neurons in our brains that exist for no other purpose than to compel us to behave this way. 

That's another depressing thing, how much like stupid meat robots we all are.

And just knowing that someone out there will read this helps just a little more, but my realization of that fact also makes it hurt just a little more. 

Am I making any sense? Probably not. I posted most of what came to mind, and I so often feel out of phase with other people anyway. I'm still afraid, but it hurts less now I guess. 

And I have trouble trusting doctors. It... So when you take your car to a mechanic you don't trust there's always a risk they might weaken something on your car so you have to go back and give them more money. Why wouldn't doctors do the same thing with the medications they give you? I know people usually say it's because they're not sociopaths, but putting aside the fact that some of them most likely are, you don't have to be a sociopath to do horrible things for money... And I've been on medications before, and I'm honestly terrified of being dragged off to a mental institution and being forced onto them again. They made me feel... Not right. And I feel like I'm taking an incalculable risk just by posting this...

Still going to I guess... I feel like I need a better conclusion. It doesn't matter, though.",1

"My wife cheated on me, little brother died, Mother disowned me, lost my Vehicle/possessions to gambling, and I felt like all was lost in this worldAll of this happened to me while I was in the military.  It all seemed like it happened at the same time.  All of it just hit me at once.  To be perfectly honest, when all these situations came to me, I felt depressed, I felt like I didn't want to be on this Earth anymore.  I had to put on a stern face when going to work because I had Marines under me that looked up to me for the leadership that I portrayed.  It seemed though that none of this could even compare to the feeling when my little brother passed away.  It might be weird to some that the others didn't hit me harder but my little bro was my life.  He was only 7 years old when his asthma took him from us.  When he passed, I fell into a very dark place.  I felt almost emotionless.  I couldn't sleep, I couldn't eat, and every bottle of pills I had looked delicious.  I wanted to die.  I started towards my cabinet and pulled out a full bottle of percs that I received when I received shoulder surgery the past month.  I had a good 60 or so.  Plenty enough to do the job.  As I opened the bottle I had the most surreal experience. 

I was never really the religious type, but at this moment it was almost like a voice spoke to me and I felt a loving presence of someone that was hugging me.  It was the craziest experience.  All I remember was I started crying and laughing at the same time but I felt like everything was going to be alright.  This sudden realization made me understand that killing myself isnt' going to fill that void inside of me, instead it's just going to open an even bigger one inside all my friends and Family.  I put the bottle away and just stared at the ceiling for a good while until I fell asleep.

After my experience I decided to give religion a go, I found a church that I liked, people that I enjoyed being around that uplifted me and helped me become the man that I used to be.  Now I'm not saying that religion is for everyone, and I know that a majority of the Reddit community is Atheist, I was too, but I found happiness in my religion, and it put me at peace.  

Today I have 2 more little twin brothers that I play with whenever I can, I am in a close relationship with my Mother again, all of my bills are now paid off, I found a career that I absolutely love and make a good salary off of it, and I am now in a relationship in which I am very close to proposing to her!  Everything that was taken away from me was brought back 10 fold :)  

Now if there is anything to take from this story, it's that if you are having thoughts of suicide, hurting yourself, hurting others, etc.  Know that there are many others like you with those thoughts as well.  I'm not going to tell you that Religion is the medicine to relieve your pains..it isn't, (though it doesn't hurt)  The real cure is patience.  When you feel as if nothing could possibly turn in your favor just know that someone out there (like myself) is going through the same thoughts and feelings you are.  Know that you are loved, and that something good will come your way with patience and perseverance.  

I'm only leaving this post in hopes that another can relate to it and know that your life is precious and not worth throwing away.  If any of you need advice or a friendly talking to then I would gratefully extend a welcoming hand to help you guys out with anything you need.  Especially with you guys being fellow Redditers, we have to look out for each other :)  ",1

"Can't stop wanting to end my existenceI don't even know where to start. Basically, everything is just getting to much to handle and I have literally 0 support for it and as a result I feel like I'm so so close to killing myself.

I am a student studying medicine and the course in itself is really tough and needs me to be on top of my game - my mental health has held me back for the last 4 years and I need to pull through during my final year.

My family life is really tough. I come from a religious background (muslim) with parents who have been emotionally and physically abusive in the past and are incredibly controlling - they pay for my entire uni which means i'm not in debt but also means that they have regularly threatened to pull me out of uni over the tiniest whim.

I was diagnosed with depression when I was 15 after losing two brothers and two grandfathers within 4 years and my family were 'supportive' of treatment (only psychotherapy) for a year but were heavily involved and my mum would regularly yell at me for being miserable.

I've kind of rushed everything but it's just getting way too hard for me to cope and I literally have no-one i can turn to. I don't have anyone in my family I can talk to. My friends are either busy or useless (in that they have nothing to say) or both. I'm constantly feeling like i'm on the edge of doing something stupid.

I've tried counselling, medication, calling helplines, all sorts. But nothing seems to work. My problem is my situation which I can't realistically get out of for at least another year, which may not seem like a long time but right now I'm struggling to make it through the day.",1

"I'm starting to feel suicidal again this year and I really need therapyThis pandemic and school semester have really pushed me into an unstable mental state and I'm constantly scared I'm close to falling apart and collapsing entirely. I'm an architecture major so my constant studio presentation deadlines have me working for 14 hours every day with really minimal time to take breaks or take care of myself properly. This extends into all my weekends and holidays. It's become so hard to stop myself from breaking down and it's become even harder to find time to spend with family or friends. My boyfriend has been going through a lot of issues with the pandemic and school as well and I can slowly feel myself become more and more unable to support him properly since I'm struggling so much myself. Its breaking my heart to see my personal love life (and family life too) strain under the tension of my struggles. I used to be pretty suicidal in high school and I'm feeling those thoughts creep back into me the more this hard year goes on.  

I'm scared because I can't do anything to immediately help either my boyfriend or myself. I'm terrified something's going to snap and I'm going to lose him or myself. I want to be happy so badly but it's becoming more and more grim each day and I dont know how many more 14 hour work days I can handle before my body shuts down. 

I desperately need therapy. I need professional guidance on how to cope with my stress and how to properly support my boyfriend in a way that doesn't hurt my own emotional state. I've always been scared of therapy because my parents raised me in a very strict mentality of thinking its taboo (immigrant parenting be like that), but I really want to just be consistent with getting professional help for once and recover properly (I tried a few times before but I always stopped going after a month or so because I always thought I I wasnt ""stressed enough"" for it later on). After my final architecture studio presentation next Thursday, I'm going to call my university counseling center and ask for help. I need to. This post is more of a reminder to myself that I really need to do this. My body can't handle anymore stress without proper professional help.

"Fuck this.I'm so tired of living and existing.

I'm not depressed, and have never suffered from depression. I'm just fed up. I am fucking sick of being told to consider other people's bad situations to make myself ""thankful"" for the pointless, meaningless life I live. I never fucking asked to be born.

I am suffering *every fucking second* of knowing that I exist. It hurts to breathe and blink. I'm fucking tired of trying to play this stupid game of living up to society's expectations so that I wouldn't feel bad about myself. I don't want to go to college or get a career or make lots of money or even get married or have sex. All of this bullshit is just a man-made scheme to delude the primates of ""humankind"" into thinking their time on this shithole has meaning. What the fuck am I supposed to do after all that? Eat ice cream? Go to the movies? Read books? Find someone who will let me ejaculate on their breasts? Lease a luxury car? Invest in the stock Market? Again, all of this bullshit is just some more distraction that I no longer want to take part of. And none of it will matter if I suffer brain damage or die. I'm going to be forgotten in the next few decades anyway. I've stopped all contact with my family just because I'm tired of them not seeing my point.

I'm only 20 now and I'm just done. I'm not sad. I'm just tired. I'm fed up with life. I never asked to be a part of this pointless, meaningless game.

Problem is that I know I have been putting in tremendous effort so far and I have been maintaining A/Bs in all my classes. 

This contrast of confidence has gotten me really put down. I can't shake the feeling that I have forgotten to learn since high school. In either 2 years or until I get a stable job, my parents are paying for my college tuition and classes. It drives my emotions to the ground knowing that I am going to end up disappointing them.

I don’t know if I want to ask for help or say that I’m ending it tomorrow. I can’t take my inability to do something anymore, my stupid inability to talk to new people in person, I can’t stand being me anymore and I can’t stand my dad anymore I just wanna die.

"My best friend/sister tried to commit suicide last nightI'm not sure if this is the right place to post this but I'm disassociate in really bad and just need to get it out. Our friend from NC messaged me telling me she drank a bottle of vodka and ate heart pills last night and I didn't find out until noon today. She's okay and she's at work but I don't know what to do. With how things are with COVID and being stuck on my campus under lockdown and the fact she's not my biological sister I couldn't go home on grievance leave or to help her since she tried to commit suicide. She has BPD and her mind translates bad things happening to ""oh it's my fault"", I'm one of the few people who can talk her out of his state and calm her down I've known her for 16 years and she's been more family to me than my own and I can't physically be there to help and I'm calling her later tonight when she's off work to talk to her and make sure she's okay. 

I need advice on what to do, I'm terrified to lose her and I can't go home right now. Any help would be fantastic, thanks",1
"I Get to be alone for a Long time.... Hey, welcome back to I tell you guys about my problems then cry about them until I fall asleep. Ready? Ok let's go


So long story short I have two best friends (one male one female) and they obviously like eachother but that dosent matter rn.

So basicly I know that one of my friends was going to go into the military but he was planning on doing 4 years of ROTC before he went in so we were going to all spend college together, yay right? Well no.

Because apparently to get where they wanted in the military (Special ops and army medic respectively) they would have a better chance if they just enlisted out of highschool AND the minimum enlistment is 5 years... they where thinking about doing 8.....

Like don't get me wrong, I want to see them reach their goals and be happy and I am going to support them and I love them both SO much but its just am so scared of losing them and us drifing apart.

I'll finish hs and most of if not all of my college before they get out and that is IF they get out because... you know... it's the military.

So anyway, if my spelling is bad I cant see due to tears in my eyes so yeah.

Thank you guys so much for always giving me a place to vent and speak, you really dont know how much it means to me. Thanks for the kind words and I hope you all have an amazing day",0

Everything that happens i have to go through on my own. I have to deal with everything alone. It fucking hurts. I cant breathe. I havent eaten all day and im going to be sick.

"No one's really sure how we got to Tennessee from Massachusetts in the summer of 2017, But we do know because of a framed receipt Maddox's mom Has hanging in the guest bathroom of her basement That we somehow ended up stopping at a Jimmy John's in  Cincinnati at 11:23 p.m. The previous Sunday. 

 No one really remembers anything from those few days outside of the receipt that parking ticket and waking up in the dumpster behind a bowling alley owned by a gentleman who looks likes Santa Claus'  Ecstasy addicted 2nd cousin.

"I hate my real life32 year old loser. Lives with mother. Pushes shopping carts for a living. Can't drive. No qualifications. No motivation or ambition. No skills or interests.

Used my grandads inheritance money to go to Japan for a month. Met a girl in Japan and lied about my life to date her because I was sick of being lonely. Had a great time with her and was actually happy for once in my life. 

Came back hone to England and sunk back into severe depression pushing me to the brink of suicide. Reached out for help from mother and she doesn't care. She doesn't speak. Just wants me to stay in my dead end job because we live under her boyfriends roof and I'll be made homeless if I quit.

Thinking about handing in my notice and just going back to Japan for Christmas anyway. It might be just for a few weeks because that will be the last of the money. I'll be homeless after I leave my job, but what is the point? I am constantly depressed as fuck anyway. Maybe I should live a few weeks more of a fantasy in Japan and then just end my life. ",1

"Hello, alt account because of obvious reasons, but I need to get something off my chest and I don’t know where else to post this.About 8 months ago I was planning to kill myself. I was going to tie a rope to a hook in my bedroom wall that was once used for a swinging suspended chair. The only thing that stopped me was the hook itself, which when I pulled on it to test if it would hold me, almost came out. 

Over the months since then, I have been to therapy and I am good now, in fact my last session is in a few days. 

My problem is that I would have done it. I would have ended my life there and then if it wasn’t for the structural weakness of the spot in the wall. That was all that stopped me, that kept me alive. I am ashamed that I came that close, and I want to believe that I didn’t do it for a reason, but the reality is I wouldn’t be here if the wall was that much stronger. I don’t want to tell anyone I came that close, they already know enough and I’m pretty much all good now. It just comes back to me ever now and again, how I was too weak to carry on, how I would have done it without thinking twice. It’s just the shame, knowing I would have thrown it all away that easily.

I don’t know what I’m looking for, in posting this. I just had to get it out, if you made it this far then thank you for reading. Have a wonderful day.",1

"My 12-year old daughter's friend (14m) has said that he's suicidal. He refuses to call the Suicide Hotline, any other kind of professional help, or tell his parents.Hi there. I'll make a quick list rather than wall of text.

1) The kid apparently doesn't have a good home life, or a good relationship with his parents. 

2) This is obviously hurting my daughter, and she is far and away my primary concern.

3) I encouraged her to call the Suicide Hotline on his behalf. They tasked her with asking details of his plan. imo, this should *not* be something that an expert tasks a personally-involved 12 year old to do. Getting non-counsellors to act like counsellors can do more harm than good...

4) My way of talking about things involves objective reality, perhaps tough love, ""this is the most selfish thing you can do"", etc. According to the info from the sidebar, this is the exact opposite of optimal. I can accept that as I'm not a trained counsellor and don't know what I'm doing here. That said, neither is or does my 12 year old daughter who's empathetic and caring. But the advice I've given her sounds a lot more like tough love than the advice given in the sidebar.

What I want to do is track down the kid's parents and tell them. Force the issue. Perhaps call 911 for a health check if nothing is done. My daughter, bless her heart, is 12 and has always hated the idea of going to parents, teachers, etc with problems. I explained that being a friend isn't always making your friends feel better, it's actually helping them. Don't make a person feel better while drowning, call the lifeguard whether or not they want to be embarrassed.

Anyway, please help. I'm mentally tough and deal well with cold, hard information. Please do not give me lesser advice to spare my feelings. I'm interested in solving the issue if at all possible. To me that means: if you can't get the kid to call for help, you call it for them.

Thanks.",1

"I guess i sorta wrote something about my last episodeI let out a sigh, it radiates throughout my room, bouncing off the walls and dissipating into the depths of the darkness that had crept in from the corners. My bones are dripping with a thick layer of melancholy and it's hard to move. My lifeless shell is a cage, seemingly oblivious to the anxiety charging against my skull. Feeling panicked, that familiar but nonetheless uncomfortable weak rush in my limbs, the pounding of my heart in every vein in my body, the indescribable desire to escape; but simultaneously I can feel the air around me that has suddenly become heavy, clinging to me and dragging me down, with a completely numb emotional state.
Where did this fog come from? How can I feel human again?
The episode lasts for days; a blur of both sleepless nights that dragged on in painful hours of tossing and turning, and days where I am barely awake, merely sleeping to escape the feelings. A blur of forcing myself to eat enough,  wondering vaguely where my appetite went and if I could go with it.

"It's not fairWhy?! I've been trying so hard! After a month of compeltely isolating myself from everything, I finally had enough strength in me to start trying to get better again. I did so much more than I thought I'd be able to in a couple of days, and now its come crashing down. Every time I'm given a slither of hope, I catch the bait, and then fall right back down to square 1. I'm so tired, I want this to stop so much. I can't kill myself, it feels like a hurdle far too high to jump over right now, but jesus fucking christ do I not want to be alive. I want to go back to before I was born, I want to have never existed in the first place. I was so proud of my pathetic attempt at progress, and now I just feel so overwhelmed again. I just hate when life decides to toss me a little bit of happiness, I was getting used to the bad feelings again, they were horrible, but not nearly as bad as they are now, directly after experiencing the ability to function slightly for the first time in over a month. It's just.. not fair.",1

"Why do we live?Hey,
My friends call me Aby , I'm 23 and I was diagnosed with Autism , Psychopathy (non aggressive) , ADHD , OCD , Anxiety and Panic Attacks , but my last 4 shrinks were unable to answer this question for me in a way to make me get going , so I ask you : Why do we live?

I had a lack of drive for a very long , mostly based on my analitycal  personality and dissecting everything to the point where my knowledge could no longer dissect it and that made me realize , my life , along with 99.999% of the planet live just to live. Each generation only a handful of people shine , and my odds of getting there are fairly low and it would be dumb to dedicate my life to an inprobable endeavor. I just can't face the fact that I'm supposed to live just to sustain myself with no higher purpose. I find it deameaning just to live for the sake of living , make a couple of mini versions of me that are likely to have worse genes than me (thanks to the involution that is happening based on adapting the medium to us , instead of adapting ourselves to the medium and the dilution of the strong genes with bad genes thanks to the limitations on natural selection we incur in the current society) and live happy that I did nothing. I feel hardly any emotions for anyone else , so I can't feel good about myself by doing ""volunteer work"" thinking that I make the world a better place , cause the people I helped are even more worthless than me , hence helping them carry on their life is futile.

So ,
Why do we live? Why should I live?
Even with an elevated IQ I can't answer that question by myself , be it from lack of knowledge or not having the proper train of thought , and maybe one of you guys holds the meaning to my life.",1

I also want to add my grandad that I was really close to died when this took place and I was barely happy after that so I was miserable and suicidal but I moved and that turned my life around for the better. I went to a new school and wasn't bullied and found a love for programming and made friends. I sometimes still contemplate whether I should kill myself but those are far to almost never.

"Hoping it would get better but im back to this loop againYep, was planning to end everything at the start of this year (during the day of my birthday) and fell off because of something unexplainable thing that forces people to go home, which made me inevitably  cancel it. I have everything ready and planned with than i have ever been, not going to explain further.

After all of this mess and whatnot, met some friends online that we chatted for hours, played games, watch movies, and so on. I really liking the friendship so far but i fucked up (as usual) recently, they become busy personal stuff (i understand), had some issues here and there. I wanna share things to them but the issues arises.

I really cannot cry for some reason, no matter how much i feel crying to the verge of my chest and tears going haywire, it's not flowing, it's not releasing, everything is a mess now and i become even more of a mess now that there is no place to be in. I cannot enjoy something at all and resort to some mindless things for mindless laugh that lasts 10 mins. and a mostly angry moments because of sheer frustration, also mostly just blankly wondering if i did just end it all. A good sleep for the whole straight day and just laying in bed after.

So far, i need some warmth in my life, i need that genuine hug of comfort, a genuine talk of something that really enjoy for both parties, genuine companionship and all. Tried everything back then and failed miserably and i don't wanna try it again as it may go that way again because im the problem.
I mean there is something exciting things that i wanna share but i feel no one is excited to hear them or even slightly interested because i will fuck it up eventually.


TL;DR: Im back on the loop again.",1

"Teacher trying to help a suicidal student, advice appreciatedApologies for the length of the post, but when a life is potentially on the line words are important. 

I'm a high school teacher (male) who just found out yesterday that my student (16yo female) is having serious suicidal thoughts. First time dealing with this situation and it's been pretty taxing. I'd really just appreciate advice on how to go about supporting my student.

We're doing Romeo and Juliet in class, she was all into it through the first couple weeks. Said she'd read it like 4 times and was super involved in the class, acting like herself. 

Then about two weeks ago she didn't participate anymore, seemed kind of not there. Yesterday we were acting out the final scene (with the double suicide) and she adamantly volunteered for the part of Juliet, and did it damn well. 

So I asked her how she had been and she hung back while the class let out for recess. Her friend was there at first.

""How have you been?""

""Not good.""

""Why not good?""

""Been thinking about my death.""

""Your death? What do you mean?""

Her friend: ""Yeah, she told me yesterday she would give me her makeup kit"" (this is definitely a prized possession, she does really cool fake blood zombie style makeup.) Friend left.

""Well, I was just thinking that I don't want to live anymore and that it would be fine if my mom went into my room to wake me up for school and saw me laying in bed covered in blood.""

Obviously that's a serious threat. She told me she had cut herself before. She has access to razor blades. This had the feeling of something that would happen the next day (today, Friday).

She expressed feelings of being alone, that nobody understands her. She's not like most 16 year old girls, has tons of personality. Reads anime, Stephen King novels, and 50 shades of Gray. Draws like a pro. Wrote a short horror story last year for English which was one of the best in a school competition. 

So we talked about that, I said she's an incredibly talented and interesting person, and I understand that people don't get her interests and that must be frustrating.

""Everybody wants me to act 'normal' and stop doing the stuff I like doing.""

Her other teachers are constantly on her ass about how she needs to act more like a girl her age.

Anyway, I came back at the end of the day and gave her my phone number, told her to call if she had any more thoughts about suicide or if she needed anything at all. She said ""really?"" with a tone that broke my heart.

**Day 2 (today, friday)**

Found out through some other students that somebody saw me give her my number, and she downplayed it in a group chat calling me creepy.

Saw her talking to another teacher, I suppose she told him what's up.

She was more active in class and seemed more responsive. She even drew me a picture, which I assume was her way of saying thanks.

We talked a few minutes at the end of the day.

""How are you feeling?""

No response.

""Are you feeling better or worse today?""

""About the same.""

""It takes time to feel better. It's okay.""

""Why does everybody want to help me?""

""Because we care about you (which I go on to explain from my point of view)""

""You don't have to be involved. I'm fine by myself I've been alone so long I've adapted.""

""I know I don't have to be, but I want to be. I want you to feel better. And it's one thing to be fine being alone, I can do that too, but if you're having these thoughts then something is wrong.""

""I don't know.""

""I just don't want you to do anything permanent. Things can get better.""

""You just can't understand what's going on in my head.""

""I know. I know. Honestly I'm not trying to understand, I'm trying to help you. Whatever I can do just let me know.""

She turned to get her stuff.

""I'm going to keep checking on you, okay.""

""My bus is going to leave.""

""See you Monday.""

And that's where I'm at. I have already talked to the school psychologist.

Wondering what else I can/should do. Thanks a lot for your help.",1

"I just wish I wasn't like thisI read a lot of these posts today, and I can commiserate with everyone. I have been in and out of hospitals. I've never been okay. And somehow I'm expected to be okay with not being okay. People aren't supposed to want to kill themselves, but I'm at the point for the millionth time where I've tried so many things all anyone can say is ""it gets better."" 

Yeah it gets better and then it gets worse again. ALWAYS. I know if I don't kill myself probably even in a few days I'll feel okay again, but I can't stand this life of ups and downs. I've been diagnosed w mood and personality disorders, but who the fuck knows, maybe I'm just weak. I do everything the doctors say. And what do they want me to do when I feel this way? Go to a hospital. To what? Embarassingly tell someone I'm sad again? Pathetic. No one even cares anymore if I hurt myself or threaten to kill myself because this is just how I am. 

I am actually a very intelligent person with a lot of good qualities, good family and friends, but I can't even enjoy life because of this darkness. No one understands. Even other people with my same mental health issues. Maybe their meds work better, I don't know. I just feel so alone on this earth. So disconnected from other humans. I always have, and I'm almost 30, and I just can't stand it any longer. My doctor says 20s and 30s are the worst for Bipolar people. I can't go another decade like this. How is anyone expected to live this way? Honestly. Don't they understand how horrible it is? 

I used to numb the pain w drugs and alcohol. I got sober a while ago, and for a bit it helped. Now, I know the drugs and alcohol will just add more fuckery to my life, so I'm not going to pick up, but I'm left with the same emptiness as when I was using. 

I tried once before to overdose, and I just got put into the hospital to stabilize me and ended up in the psych hospital for 2 weeks. And what am I going to do? Just keep going back to the hospital my whole life? I really don't see another option. 

I know my parents will be crushed. I know they love me. It's not like I'm depressed because I think everyone hates me. I just don't think I can live with this pain. I just want the pain to stop. And don't say it's a permanent solution to a temporary problem. This problem is NOT temporary. It's been going on my entire life. Yes, I've had a few sunny days, but most of my life has been riddled with anxiety, panic, depression, mania, paranoia, delusions...it's honestly torture. And I'm trapped inside my own head. ",1

When I had my next session, they were quite angry at me. They are always super patient with me but they were really blunt this time around. Ex. I kept on   burrying my face into my hands and they said, ""sit up""

They were also talking about how hard hearing the news of my death would have been on my friends and them. 

They were giving me a no bs attitude. 

I honestly think the anger from them was just what I needed to snap into the reality of the situation and I found it quite heartwarming that they cared so much to have this kind of reaction...

BuT...
Im worries that this anger is going to remain present in my future sessions.. and I dont think I could handle that 

Im also worried I ruined this relationship like they'll never trust me again or they're going to act cold towards me in order to protect their own feelings.

I guess my question is..
Is this a normal reaction to get from you therapist? Do you they could have some countertransference ?

It may be even more than that but that's just what I've seen. I've been alive for a phase like that where she would buy leggings from lula roe. She only stopped because it turned out to be a pyramid scheme. She's also done the same thing other times like buy beanie babies but I wasn't alive at the time. I think she only does it to deal with stress, but even if that is the reason she has to find something else to release her stress and it shouldn't be berating me or my sisters either. This whole thing just reminds me of how much I dislike my mother because of how horrible she is, I would get into it but this post is just mostly about how annoyed I am and stressed out I am that's shes wasting all this money on cups she'll never use. My family has thought of doing an intervention but we never act on it because we know she'll never listen and just pretend to be the victim. I hope this phase ends soon, so I dont have to hear her complain about not having money but then spend about $1,000 on cups.


Long story short, my mom going through phases of buying specific things to release stress while also complaining about having no money.",0

"Am I suicidal? I'm scared, not sure what to do.I don't really want to post anything here, and I'm sorry if this is the wrong place to post this, I don't know the rules, and I don't have the time to read them right now.  I'm just afraid.  I don't do anything, my house is filthy, and I just dont clean anymore, no matter how much I want to, everything is my life is falling to bits, everyday, I do my best to smile for the people around me and make sure they think I'm happy, but the truth is, I'm stagnating.  I'm disappointing the people around me, my parents, my friends.  I never pay attention to any friends but Chris, and it just seems like too much trouble to leave the house and do it anymore, everything just seems like ""why bother"", its at the point where when I do actually leave, I justify myself around them every time, and it just makes me look like a damn martyr when all I want to do is be a good damn friend, but I can't even bring myself to do that anymore.  I don't even feel sad really, or maybe I do, I'm not sure.  All I know is everyday I find myself wishing I wasn't around, more and more often.  At first it was just sleeping a lot, but the longer it goes, the more I find myself thinking about how I would end it all.  I'm scared, I don't want to be thinking like this.  But today I found myself thinking about the gun in the lockbox upstairs, its the only quick way I could think of, and its terrifying me that I'm thinking this way.  I'm almost certain that I would have done it already if it wasn't for my girlfriend Hannah and my best friend Chris.  Hannahs going through a hard time and needs my support right now, and Chris is my best friend, I can't stand the thought of just abandoning him like that.  But even when it comes to him, I just lie to him all the time, he knows I do, I know I do, I know I wont get away with it, and I hate myself for it, but I can't stop.  And now I'm afraid I'm lying to myself about wanting to live.  I'm just scared, and I want to know if this is normal or I need help or what.  Why do I want to die so much, and if I really want to, why am I fighting it.   This is the first time I'm really asking anyone for help, I don't want people knowing I'm like this.  Again, I'm really sorry if this isn't the right place to post this.  Thank you for your time.",1
"Are any of us really real?What's real? Am I real? Are you real? Our problems seem giant. I feel incredibly lonely. My problems stem from me. Therefore, thinking about this logically, terminating myself also ends my problems. It might be selfish. But the guilt will also end with me. I want to be loved by someone. I'm 18 and that has never happened. I don't know how. This will end if I do. I can't feel alone if I can't feel anything. I don't believe in an afterlife. Me and all of my problems will simply cease to exist. My perception dictates my reality. Removing the ability to perceive removes the hurt. This is a logical step.",1

"Advice needed For transparency, this is about my teenage daughter.   She is 18 and started college last Fall. 

She is very introverted and has a very hard time making friends.  She is extremely smart but also very awkward and has very little self confidence.   

Iâ€™m trying to help her come out of her shell and get out and meet more people.   Itâ€™s just not working.  She stays in her dorm room all day .. she rarely sees her roommate who shacks up with her boyfriend.   

Any suggestions from teenagers out there to help her?  What could a parent say to you that would help?  Anything?? 

Thanks for your advice!",0
"I'm so fucking tiredMy house is falling apart. No one likes me. And my mind is clouded with suicide. It's been a solid year since I've attempted suicide. I can't stand it. I'm sick of being the funny guy.

I'm kinda being fucked over by this girl, she keeps fucking with me, then blowing me off like I'm some insignificant sack of shit. Then comes back for love. Every time I she comes back, I can't help but give in. And I just end up getting my hopes up, just so they can be torn down like the Berlin wall. 

Better yet, my father is a drug addict, and it's destroying my family, I'm woke up to my mom screaming about how she wants him gone, but he'll only get high, and forget about it the next morning. It's killing me,  I just wanna leave.

Then I can't find it to better myself. There are only 7 people keeping me here,  and I'm pretty sure they'd get over it pretty quick if I just fucking cut it. Everyone else would be like ""He WaS mY bEsT fRiEnD"" or ""I nEvEr SaW tHiS cOmInG"" or some other dumb shit. I might just do it.

Also, my sister is always urging me to the next level. For some context, I use suicide jokes as a coping mechanism, and I went to pick her up from band practice and someone asked her why I was so suicidal. I'm the car she went OFF talking about how much of a shitty person I was, and how I'm not allowed to joke about suicide, but if I did no one would care. And that's just one of many examples. So, she's like the imperial powerhouse of a contribution.

Please give advice, I'm fucking wasting away.",1
"My last breath. Thank you. 06-15-2020.My last breath.
It is time. 

After 22 years of my life here I am.
Oh have I waited for this moment for a long time now.
I feel different knowing that all of it will end today. The pain, the suffering and the trauma. All of it will vanish within an hour.

Weirdly enough, I actually feel ""happy"" for the first time in years, knowing that I can be at rest. 

I have no one left, no one to visit my grave, no one to be sad from my passing. No one who'll remember me in a few years. But it's okay, at least I know I tried my best. I tried making everyone around me happy while I myself was being eaten inside out from my own thoughts and feelings. Gutted. Murdered. By my own feelings. 

I have nothing more to add since probably no-one will see this anyways. 

But if anyone of you see this, remember this day.

I donâ€™t know what to do because these people make up like 70% of my friends and Iâ€™m scared because I have some private shit on my phone (nothing illegal but just shit you donâ€™t want sharing).

"Its timeThis has been a long time coming and Im ready. I lost my career a few years ago and all my savings with it. I have tried to find other work but no one seems to want to hire an older man. My wife and I have not been intimate for quite awhile and I miss her but she doesnt seem to care. I have two kids and its obvious my son doesnt need me anymore. We used to be so tight and did so many things together. I understand tho. He is 18 and has his own life.

My daughter is 12 and is a typical pre teen. She doesnt seem to like me very much tho. Ive tried, no one and I mean no one can say that I havent. 
I am a burden and I know this. I can see it in their faces, esp my wife and my sons.
Ive accepted that this is how my life will be if I hang around, but instead I have made a plan that will insure my death and their profit. It wont look like suicide.

I dont drink or stay out or do stupid shit to my family. Ive always tried to be a good husband and father but the odds are so stacked against me this is really the only way out for me.

Not really sure why Im posting, anyway, ive talked to some nice people on reddit and I wish you guys the best",1
"Im posting this on my main account. I don't care anymore. I doubt I'll make it to the end of the year.As I write this I'm not really feeling a whole lot emotionally. Physically I sort of feel like crying even though I just feel numb. It's a strange feeling.   


I have no real plans to hurt myself, but I've kind of given up. I barely get out of bed most days now. I'm kind of just letting myself wither away at this point. In the past month I've left my apartment maybe 3 times, to get groceries. Can't get myself out most of the time honestly. 

My family doesn't really seem to give much of a shit about me. I think it would take actual weeks for them to find me if I were to die. I've expressed so many times that I'm really \*\*\*NOT\*\*\* doing so great and that I'd really like to move home - not even permanently, maybe for a couple years. I just can't stand living alone anymore. I miss my family but I get shrugged off by them all. Or ignored. My mom keeps saying ""We'll talk about it"" but really what she means is we're not going to talk about it. She's saying that to get me to shut up. I really have no redeeming qualities, can't hold down a job (my record was about 9 months, woo fucking hoo), I can't fucking socialize like everyone else, there's literally nothing to live for. I used to get joy out of eating good food but now I don't even get joy out of that. I'm just fat and food has become a crutch. I want to starve myself but my fat ass can't go a god damn day without shoveling some garbage into my face.   


I know me dying would hurt my family a lot but why should I have to suffer like this? I contribute nothing to society, family only contacts if they really need something, I have no friends. I think the earth would be better off without me in it.

"Here's what's going on in Texas for those who don't know There was a big snowstorm a couple days ago. Gas is something you have to pay for there, which they voted on (red state). republicans dont think gas should be provided by the government and because they voted against it, it isn't. It was a really bad snowstorm as a result of climate change (one of the worst in texas history, and they don't get much snow there).

So, some people can't afford the gas and the concern is they'll freeze to death in their own homes because they don't have gas. Gas isn't just heat either, their water isn't being treated by the state right now and stoves aren't working to cook. 

At least 25 people have died as of 24 hours ago. To give you an idea of it 3 kids died when they accidentally lit their house on fire trying to stay warm and a man was found frozen to death in his recliner.

Despite doing well at school and in music, I still feel like a disappointment due to several bad behavioural tendencies, such as a short and violent temper. I have a lot of issues with anxiety due to constant bullying, and a lot of the time I feel like I have no worth.

I have tried to get help in the past, but it hasn't worked, and any time I've mentioned wanting to kill or harm myself to my parents they've gotten angry and called me stupid. I feel like I cannot get any form of help, due to an ingrained paranoia that something will go horribly wrong.

I have tried cutting myself, but have always been to weak to do it, which doesn't help matters either.

So, long story short, I feel ready to end it all. But I feel so conflicted, as people keep trying to show me the good in my life but I just throw it off, or they threaten to replicate it if I do kill myself.

I don't see any reason or hope to continue liek this, it's pointless.

A month ago, I lost the woman of my dreams (I know how this sounds, but it's not my first relationship) because I became consumed by stress and became a different person. After the breakup, I headed on the road to recovery, and have brought around positive changes in myself.

Friday night, though, I discovered that she had begun dating my best friend two weeks after breaking up with me. I care deeply about both of these people, and am committed to living with both of them for the summer already (no way to back out). I have to see them and work with them every day.

Those around me know that I'm bad right now, but they don't know how bad. I've lied to counselors, professors, and friends who have all asked me the same question: Are you in any danger of harming yourself? I am.

"Silly problem compared to some, but it means so much to me.First world problems incoming. 
  
 
I am a 30F veterinarian who has been out of school for about 5 years. I love my job so much- it's all I've ever wanted to do, and it's the one thing I've worked for and desired above all else. It's a huge part of how I define myself, and really the only thing I like about myself. 
 
 
Unfortunately, I suck at it. I have made mistakes and hurt patients. One patient even died because of a reaction to a drug I prescribed. I'm clumsy and slow in surgery, and I'm generally not a good doctor. I feel an incredible amount of guilt for it- I love my patients, and want so much to help them. When the opposite happens repeatedly, it makes me want to die. The people I work with are amazing, and have saved my ass so many times, but I can't keep asking them to bail me out. If I were learning and growing, that would be one thing. But I'm not. I keep failing my patients, and letting down the owners who trusted me and put their beloved pets in my incompetent hands. 
 
 
So it has to end somewhere. Honestly, I should have quit years ago- it was my own selfishness and hope that I would get better with time that has been keeping me going. I am supposed to be moving with my boyfriend to the west coast this summer, once he is done with grad school. I keep trying to imagine a life with him doing something else, and it just seems so... impossible. 
 
 
Because I don't want to do anything else. I never have. Losing this huge part of myself and having nothing to replace it, makes all the good things in my life look small and meaningless. My boyfriend is supportive, and says he just wants me to be happy in whatever I do, but I feel so guilty about letting him down, and about having nothing to offer him in return when he gives so much to me. 
 
 
I've tried to fix this. I've tried a few therapists. I've even tried antidepressants. None of these things help- because none of them solve the problem. Talking about being bad at my job doesn't make me suddenly better at it. Pills don't suddenly make me a better surgeon. Everything just keeps going around in circles. I guess, at some point, I have to choose to accept that my life will not be what I have always wanted it to be. But I just don't know how to be ok with that. 
 
 
Right now, the most appealing solution to the problem is suicide. I have a gun, as well as of course access to drugs through my job. I don't love the option, and I think it would probably hurt my boyfriend. But I also think he would get over it. He's younger than me, attractive, will be going into a high-paying job... he will find someone else, who can be more of an equal to him. Beyond him, I mostly have acquaintances rather than friends. 
 
 
I don't know what I'm hoping to find with this post. I just wish there was another option. I can't keep being a vet. But I also can't truly let that dream go, and without doing so I don't think I can be happy. If you're not happy... what's the point? What else is there, if you've tried therapy and you've tried medications, and you still think killing yourself is the best option? I know there are people all across the world who have it so much worse off than me, but even with that I just can't make myself see much value in the rest of my life.

":( This came to me in a half-asleep state. Read if you want to.:( I don't know why I am writing this...or if there is a point...or what I am still doing here (was foiled every time I wanted to grab my pills yesterday by kids coming in...having to help with supper...etc.) or...what I am still doing beating this dead horse. No pun intended. You don't need to reply. I think everyone has been super-nice here and they  have said everything that they can say to me. I was just told by a friend that I am not listening to him no matter what he says and that I am determined to kill myself...and he stopped short of saying ""just go do it already..."" I think if he HAD said that...I wouldn't be posting right now. He took this all as a failure on his part and made me feel so bad and guilty. He brought up my family and I ""yelled"" at him saying that I have to hear that constantly and doesn't he think that this is all tearing me up inside? I KNOW it would hurt them...I didn't need that guilt too. You see, he has a HUGE crush on me ever since he'd seen my videos on YouTube, and now he keeps trying to get me to talk dirty to him and be sexual with him over Messenger on Facebook. I keep telling him that I like him as a friend but that I am NOT interested in doing any of that stuff because I am married with a family, which he acknowledges fully!! He makes me uncomfortable. He said he is sorry when he makes me uncomfortable and creeped out, then he continues doing it anyhow. I don't want to lose him as a friend (he is a subscriber on my YouTube channel and helps me with my video stuff too) but I am not sure I can continue since he knows how much I want to die and our friendship has gotten really...weird now. It is awkward almost.

 I can't seem to go through with my plans though, no matter how much I really want to (not very much right now--I feel more cotton-headed than usual) because every time I try, something stops me...I get interrupted...something happens that stops me. My mind won't even let me think about doing it now. Literally! It's like when I try to think about things, my mind goes elsewhere or I hear a high-pitched buzzing and even kind of whispering, but distant and soft. This whispering isn't telling me to do anything specific, it is more like in a church before the service starts and everyone is having soft conversations that have nothing to do with you. 

Anyhow, this story came to me in a half-asleep state (I am also extremely sick with a horrible cold that I have had for about 3 or 4 days now and I spend a lot of my day half-asleep)...can you figure out who the subject is?


Just how long have you been feeling this way? Not sure, but she has been at this a long time. As a teenager, she was never taken seriously when she threatened suicide. They put her away in a hospital many times, but nobody believed she was serious. She was just looking for attention. She was cutting herself for the attention it brings. Many hospitals, no real help. She won't talk to a professional in fears of getting locked away again. It is a vicious cycle that keeps repeating, even though now she is way past the age where teen angst and young problems like this are ""acceptable"" and even though now she has a family to help support and run. These episodes had slept for periods of time as she had borne children, which were the happiest days of her life after getting married. The problems were always there, just buried deep in maternal instincts that not even the darkness could touch.

Now, however, she is cutting once again. She goes through these cycles every few years when the weight of the darkness just can't be tolerated anymore. Long, angry cuts on her arms but nowhere else. Nowhere else is satisfying enough as her arms and the backs of her hands...and her wrists. The cuts hurt, but oh, the pain is lovely and welcomed. Every time that (cutting tool) cuts deeper, it is like a thousand suns shining on her and like her soul can finally fly free...if only for a few minutes. She doesn't care about her problems at home and everything that needs repairs but aren't able to be fixed because the money is just not there. She doesn't think about the fact that her children might come in and find her bloody. It is total freedom.

Then, after a short time, she crashes back to Earth and all the problems from which she had just flown free all come crashing back in on her. All the repairs. The money problems, which aren't TERRIBLY significant, but are there. The need to care for little souls every day of their lives until they are old enough to fly away from the nest. The fact that if they HAD found her bloody and half-out-of-it, that they would have been scarred for life. All of it. Crashing, crushing, tumbling...making her fall back down the pit she was just climbing out of and making her feel helpless and hopeless.

Now we find her laying across her bed, staring at her laptop as she tries to find the motivation to do the one thing she thought made her happy. She stares at the screen where her favorite thing is all ready for her, but she just looks at it, or right through it, and sees nothing but blackness. The darkness has come for her again, and this time, she doesn't know if she even has the will or strength to fight it again. She feels like just giving in and doing what it is telling her she should have done years ago as a teenager...end her life. End her suffering. She thinks of her kids and how they would scream. She can hear them screaming, not in her head, but in her heart. She thinks of her husband, who is trying to be so supportive of her right now, but who also has no clue exactly how to do that. It isn't enough now. It is too little, too late, and she feels herself slipping further and further away from them...and into the blackness which is waiting for her.

She grabs the pills...the only other way she can think of right now and...

...Curtain drops...

Scene.


Sigh. It felt good to type that.

I took my husband to a movie yesterday. We had a real date (day out together while our 16 year old and her girlfriend, who is 18, babysat her siblings) for the first time in forever. It was so nice. I had a nice time. The movie was awesome too but the mood was ruined by the fact that our water heater has broken and we have NO hot water right now. Thank goodness it's under warranty still and will be replaced as soon as we get someone to help hubby take it out of here.

Sorry for the wall of text.
Thanks for everything guys. You don't know how you have all made these past few days almost tolerable for me. I am trying to hold out for Friday. Have that T appointment.

"My dark passengerI just want to be ok. I wake up every morning disappointed I woke up. I spend most days in bed knowing that to continue on my day with a fake smile is a lie and it hurts. Within the past week I've heard numerous times how people love my optimism yet I can never tell them I don't mean it. I just say the things that need to be said so people leave me alone. I find comfort in solitude, yet it's also when I'm the saddest. I just want a break or for something to show me to keep going it'll pay off real soon. I just want to be alone, to be forgotten so I can disappear without hurting anyone's feelings. I just want to cry. I just want a hug telling me I'll be ok. I just want my friend to comeback from heaven to give me advice like he use to. I just want my story to end.",1
"Societal pressureSo for context I’m 20yrs old &amp; from TX, USA. The past few years I’ve been going deeper and deeper down the rabbit hole of feeling isolated and out of place, I have an inescapable feeling that I do not belong where I am and that there simply isn’t a place for me in the world I live in. Since childhood I was encouraged to seek out things in life that bring me joy and fulfillment, this was something I’ve carried with me since and it’s only become more and more problematic. My one true passion in life is running and unless your the best around there isn’t any money to be made from that, and very few jobs within that market that don’t already have thousands of more qualified candidates waiting in line with resumes in hand. I’ve only worked to jobs before, one was a project job in a big group and everyone chose the hours they worked (I chose to show up as little as I could) and the other job only lasted one day due to a panic attack three hours into my shift which sent me running home with tears in my eyes. The biggest issue that ties in with all this is my political stance, I’m so fucking against the way that America functions, in literally almost every capacity. It’s inefficient, slow, for profit, corrupted, racist, sexist, homophobic, and resistant to fundamental change. So I really struggle seeing how I could ever live with myself having a job at which my pay was taxed to support that system, does that make any sense? I couldn’t stand myself contributing to a system that I so strongly disagree with, it’d be breaking the strongest morals I have. It’s not like I make it out of the country as I don’t have they finances to find such a journey, and my family is poor enough already, not to mention the absolute parasite I’ve already been to them only costing money never bringing any in. So with no job prospects, no cool rich relative to work for of the record, no way of getting established in a new country that I’d be happy to support, I don’t know what I’ve left to do? Sure I could live off the streets leaching off the good nature of strangers, sure I could cheat the system and earn myself life in prison to live off the taxpayers’ dollars, but what kind of quality of life is that? I’d rather call the shots to whatever degree I can and end things on my own terms. I haven’t got to planning it out yet but it’s getting there for sure, things haven’t changed in too long and my own psyche is weighing on me beyond comprehension.....

If you made it this far along, thank you, you’re the only people to have heard this. I really hope it made some sense",1
"Look in the mirror. There is only one of you. That person that you are looking at is yourself, you will only ever exist one time in the entire life span of the entire universe. You are more unique than you know. Your face is the composition of gifts from the millions of stars that died just so you could live. Once you die you cannot be brought back, and life is to precious of a gift to just let go. When times are hard just think of this. I don't know you, I have never even seen a picture of you, I don't know how you act or how you feel. I also don't know who you care for or who cares for you, but know this. I love you. I love you because you are made up of exactly what I am. Not for the religion you choose, or the clothes you wear. Or even the color of your eyes, or how beautiful you may be. Your molecular matter is nearly identical to mine, yet so different. We are all brothers and sisters, and nothing is more important than family. So please when you feel like you are cornered in with your claws out and at your wits end...Just remember there is someone out there that will miss you very very much.",1

It has been seven months since I last hung out with my social circle. I never go out except for school and work. I spend my time reading and browsing the internet. On the latter I met my love. We talked for months before she came over for a visit. It was amazing and we continue to talk every night for hours. She has held off my departure for months now. I am a schizophrenic who has stopped taking his meds and going to his therapy sessions. I am becoming worse. Before I completely lose control over who I am  a choice was made by me to take my own life. The following text is my last statement and I must say that I have enjoyed 19 wonderful years of life.

I just drifted away. Once my eyes shut I moved on. I was at peace and no pain was felt. Mom after everything I want you to know that you were the best and no matter what I love you. The same goes for the rest of my family even if we were thousand miles a part. For my only true love I cant imagine words to comfort you at this time. Be happy and live on like I never could. My last thoughts were of you. Past,present, and future events played through my head. The only regret I carried to my death was not loving you longer. Dont try to understand my actions, ignore the voices in your head telling you that you could have done something. Truth be told I was lost a long time ago. Living just became another reason I felt hate towards myself. Love others and seek knowledge. In my short existence those were the only truths I felt man needed to justify his own purpose in life. All you touch and all you see. Is all your life will ever be. Im thankful for being alive and experiencing the human condition. It lasted just the right amount of time. Love, H

"So, i did it. I finally confessed to my crush I know that there are lots of likewise posts in here, and mine is no different. When I asked her if she had someone on her mind, she said that â€œwe havenâ€™t even finished school yetâ€. Her response to a question if she did like someone but felt she was not ready for a relationship was: â€œit is personal, not publicâ€. I understand that, and respect her choice but can do nothing but be heartbroken. I had feelings for her for the last FIVE years, but was too afraid to tell her. Recently, my friends convinced me to confess, and I did. I have no regret, but am just really sad for I really thought that my feelings were mutual.",0

My life is a jokeBAM generic ass title for this shitshow. I’m a fuck up. I’ve fucked up a million times and I’m gonna keep fucking up over and over again because that’s just how I am. I’m not allowed to be anything but a useless fuck up. Every second of every single day is just more and more bullshit piling up. Like today. I finally had a good day going. I went to the psychiatrist and was feeling pretty good. I even decided to stop and pick up a movie to watch tonight. But of course since this is my shitty fucking life we’re dealing with something HAD to go wrong. I wreck my car. I’m now officially fucked. I can’t have a single good day. It’s all over. I just want a good day. So I’m giving up. I come home and try to find my knife so I can just cut my wrist and be down with it. And guess what? I CANT EVEN FIND MY GODDAMN KNIFE SO I CAN KILL MYSELF. It’s literally a sick cosmic joke. Fuck everything.,1

"You are not crazy. The world is. You are not depressed, you have a natural reaction to the very unnatural conditions we are subjected to.Your psychiatrist will tell you that you have a chemical imbalance (and you do), but it doesn't come from nowhere. With the exception of serious mental disorders such as Schizophrenia, there is nothing inherently wrong with your brain. Despite having a claustrophobia inducing 7.9 billion people on this planet, we are living in quite possibly the loneliest era our species has ever seen. We spend our days going to school, working 9-5s and going online, day after day, interacting with people whom we may care about, but don't truly connect with and everything, while advertisers vye for our attention, we are practically forced to compete in the narcissistic, arrogance creating game of social media if we want any chance at a social life, we are bombarded with images of wealth and beauty that no average person can ever hope to attain and everyone around us tells us that this is okay, that this in normal, even though they themselves are usually suffering the consequences of this way of life too. We have been led to believe that this is the best way, if not the only way to live, simply because we get fatter and live longer than our ancestors or people in poorer countries. But you know what they have/had that we don't? Purpose, community and tranquility. Instead of forests, clear rivers and rolling green plains of crops, we have buildings, roads, lawns, McMansions, cars soaring past each other at 75 MPH, the Kardashians and corn monocultures. Instead of intact families, self confidence and hope, we have a 50% divorce rate, people becoming agoraphobic because they're afraid to go out in public and a generation of people who will never retire. Instead of children playing outside and a kind, nurturing society which accepts and cares for it's members, we have kids glued to tablets and acting like teenagers 10 years ago, a rising homeless population and people being excluded from society altogether because they don't fit the Status quo or meet the increasingly competitive standards for success educationally, economically, socially or romantically in the modern world. Rather than preventing crime, we focus on inflicting suffering on those who commit it. You can be thrown in a psych ward and medicated against your will if you're deemed a threat to yourself or others. We are the most depressed, pervasively sad generation in living memory and possibly recorded history. The state is prepared and willing to come down heavy with violence against anyone who challenges this beyond simply complaining about it. But hey, at least we've got Big mac's and the average life expectancy is 79 years. /S

"Live vicariously through meI think about suicide all the time. I am sooooo broke, depressed, and now live in my car even though I work a full time job and do side gigs. I am my grandmothers sponsor therefore I’m financially responsible for her. It’s the only reason I’m alive. If I was gone, no one would be pay for her assisted living or even watch out for her. I love her and resent her. I’ve been thinking about suicide ever since I can remember. I don’t even remember the last time I was actually even semi happy but I’m stuck because I love her. 

If this wasn’t the case and I actually had some money, I’d go far far away. Somewhere like Tuvalu where people actually seem to care about each other. Where life moves slow and not everything involves so much technology and material things. I think that’d be the one thing that could help me with my suicidal thoughts.. just completely changing my life. 

But I can’t do that, so if you have the means to do so, why don’t you try? Don’t move to a different city.. move to a different continent. If you are planning to kill yourself, move somewhere else. Change everything. You have nothing to lose and maybe just maybe you’ll actually be happy to Alive and if so, I’d love to live vicariously through you.",1

"Tired, lost, wanting to give up.I'm tired. I'm tired of my life, I'm tired of my brain that doesn't work like it should, and I'm tired of making everyone else around me unhappy.

I'm tired of being ill. I'm a hypochondriac, but on top of that I also have a lot of health problems. Unfortunately, I can't always tell the difference between the two. My constant stress and anxiety don't help my health either. My friends and family are sick of hearing about my health problems and have stopped believing me when I tell them something is wrong with me. I'm in so much pain from random illnesses that seem to keep popping up. Sometimes I'm in 3 or 4 different types of pain at once. I've felt so much of both types of pain in my life, yet somehow I haven't built up a tolerance to either. I'm still so weak.

I can't seem to control myself. No matter what I do, everything that comes out of my mouth sounds negative, even when I'm not trying to be negative. It's just that there's so many negative things going on that it's so hard not to say them. I have no filter. I say pretty much everything that I think. I think a lot of dark thoughts. I'm pretty sure it's wearing my friends out. Yet when I try to keep things to myself, I feel like a balloon that a fat person is sitting on.

I've heard people talk about friends/family members who are selfless, patient and kind. I used to be like that, but I've turned into a selfish, bitter, impatient, negative person. I still have one thing left I want to try, but I am about ready to give up on the idea of me being sane and happy.

I don't have anybody right now. I had three close friends. One I grew apart from and we never seem to have anything to talk about because we're both depressed and don't have that much in common. Another talks to me about once a week. The other broke up with me a few weeks ago and we still talk but we always argue and nobody really cares about their exes the way they care about their significant other.

I don't know what to do, or who to go to. I've never really had someone who cared enough about me to check up on me and take care of me when I need it. Kind of like a mother, or a really good significant other. It might be because I'm so needy and don't give anything back. I want to. I try. It's just that I think of myself and my problems first, and it takes conscious effort to think about anything else. Sometimes I talk about myself and the good things in my life instead and I think I've succeeded in being positive...then I remember that I'm still being self-centered and a shitty friend.

"Just a little thing to talk out loud for onceWell to start things off I’ve been at the lowest stage of my life, family has stopped associating with me a while back so I got no one to talk to. I’ve been homeless for a year and have only recently been able to stay in a hotel every once in a while, jobs have been hard to come by so I’ve resorted to live by unemployment which really hasn’t helped considering I really don’t get much to sustain a healthy lifestyle. I’m a 22 year old male living a complete life of solitude which has put me in a mindset where I can’t get out of this hole I’ve put myself in, its as if when I try to reach out there’s always something to push me under even more, I really don’t want to have suicidal thoughts but is as if the world has put a giant weight on me to the point where there’s no getting out anymore. The looks I get as if I don’t belong where I’m at, it just hurts to the point where I’m disgusted with myself and can’t even look at myself without hating every being in my reflection.

it’s been a week since I left this group. a week. I joined back today and I have only been here for a few hours and it’s un-fucking-bearable. I just told you I was gonna kill myself if I didn’t get help (which I just got back from an attempt) and what happened? the chat died as soon as I sent my message and it’s not like it was inappropriate. and then you sent images of people’s art/sculptures of pride-themed animals. 

“thanks a lot. I *reaaaaaaally* needed it”

god, I hate you all. none of you even cared. none of you EVER cared. I can’t even fucking leave because I’ve already committed to being here. you all are fucking wonderful. said no one ever.

talk to the rest of the group and tell them how terrible I am. talk shit about me where I can blatantly see. or don’t. I don’t care. say how I’m unstable and I need to be put in a mental hospital. kick me out. I don’t fucking care. not anymore.

and this doesn’t go to the nice ones; the nice ones know who they are and know this isn’t directed towards them. but the rest of them?

I haven’t slept properly in 3 months now, I’ve been studying all day long every single day since the start of my school year. The stress is insane, i used to have many hobbies that I enjoyed and now I don’t have time for them since I am always studying. The fact that my marks aren’t improving proves my stupidity, and honestly I don’t want to wake up for tomorrow’s exam.

However I got depressed few weeks after it and had suffered depression and suicidal thoughts months before it. Whenever I remember the days I had no scar I just get more depressed.

"I don't even know what to say.I just wanted to tell my ex that I never lied. I really do love you. I'm sorry I gave up, but I was going through stuff that will boggle your mind. It caused me so much anxiety on top of everything I already was going through that I started dissociating a lot and my cognitive abilities had gone out the window. I haven't even looked at another woman since we broke up. 

Anyways, every day is a massive struggle, and I miss you so much. I hope you're okay. I can't go one day without thinking about you. I also can't go one day without my mind bearing towards running away and ending my life, not because of what happened to us, but because I can't even do simple tasks anymore. I can't even talk to someone without my anxiety flaring up and threatening to incinerate me. I can't even find the energy to wash myself or make something to eat.

Every morning I wake up from one dreadful dream into another. This world is so empty without you. I love you so much. 

I want to get away but no matter where I go, it's always present, and through me and everything else like the Higgs boson field or something. I guess I can't run away from myself. God I hate myself. I'm so pathetic. I often imagine someone pulverizing me into the ground until I'm one with the dirt. I wish I could tear my chest open with my hands and throw myself into a spike. 

I'm worth less than someone's spit.

If someone tries to earnestly talk to me, I just switch off. My eyes can't focus, and my ears start ringing. I can't help it, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

I'm a huge disappointed to my family, especially my dad. God I'm desperate to die before my parents do. But how could I do that to them? But else is there. I really don't want to hurt or disturb anyone with my end. 

Often I think about how many people have already died. So many people with hopes, dreams, aspirations, and... Fears. All of them gone. The ears that have heard the wind blow through the trees. The feet that have felt the soil between their toes. The hands that have helped someone up. The eyes that have seen the sun's bright light on everything around them. The feelings that have been hurt, and the attitudes to be forgiving, and grateful; they're all gone. 

Sorry for rambling on. 

I feel sub-human. When a bug dies, no-one bats an eyebrow. I'm an insect. 

Anyways... I love you honey. Always will. You're an amazing person and I deeply respect and love you. I can't say how sorry I am. I wish things were different.

I was in bed restless and went to bed at like 4:00am unfortunately no dreams tonight but then I woke up at 8:30 turned on my computer for zoom joined my first class then immediately went back to bed. I woke up later and was like 10 minutes late to my 2nd class but I didn't care because the teacher is pretty annoying and always started the class 5 minutes late anyways so I stayed up for a couple of minutes entered a breakout room and took another like 20 minute nap when I woke up it was time to leave and so I spent lunch in bed and on my phone

After that I got up did my morning stuff then came back to start my second class once that was over I put my dog outside and responded to a bunch of reddit comments I got and the occasional text I then proceeded to scroll through instagram and have a fucking aneurysm over the among us memes I then proceeded to contemplate my existence 

Moving on I played some botw instead of doing work during my fourth class and my mom cam home for lunch brought me some food from a new local mexican restaurant it was pretty good I watched some youtube and ended my last class

I joined a new discord for an artist that I follow on insta really friendly crowd then played rocket league and now I am currently doing homework even if I stopped to write this I also read the latest issue of the Down To Earth Webtoon and man could I relate poor kade.

"feeling closer and closer to ending itI’ve tried to kill myself in the past. I felt better for a long time but recently I’ve felt it’s inescapable. I’ve recently been to A&amp;E for suicidal thoughts and was told that the fact I think about how much it will hurt my family is a preventative sign. They sent me away with some advice about putting lavender under my pillow (as if 7 years of multiple therapies and medication can be topped by putting flowers under my pillow). 

Well now I’m starting to no longer worry about my family as much. It feels bad to say, but I can’t live with the pain my anxiety is causing me every day any more. I’m tired of waking up and feeling my chest be crushed by the weight of it. I’m tired of being a burden to my family and my partner. I know it will hurt them, but I am hurting so much. I am in therapy again. I am medicated. And it’s still not enough. I don’t think I will ever escape this. 

I know I’m loved, but I can’t escape this pain no matter how hard I try. I’m sorry this post is so messy. I’m just feeling closer and closer to actually going through with it. I’m sorry.",1

"Feeling more and more desperate...I have severe manic depression, the extent of which most people around me never truly realize. People tell me to chill, to deal with it, make my concerns out to be nothing, and that hurts almost as much as the depression itself. Lately, it has been spiraling downward, becoming worse and worse with each passing day. I fall further down, and it takes more and more effort to be okay again, to just get to some vague semblance of neutrality. I've had manic episodes, but they're so very rare, now. I'm miserable every day, crying my eyes out to silence. It feels as though there is an army surrounding me, attacking me, and there isn't an end in sight. With each enemy I take down, a hundred more take its place. I'm growing so very tired. I can't fight much longer, if at all. It has gotten to the point where I just want to stop. In my relationships, it feels as though all the problems are caused by me. I truly feel those around me would be better off without me. I gave my knives to my girlfriend, but I never really thought I'd use them. I'm more likely to take every pill in the house, or lock myself in the garage with the car running. I don't like pain. But I don't want to live anymore. I want to stop fighting, to lay down and give in, let it end. I am so weary of fighting. I need help, and I don't know where else to turn.",1
"""survived"" attempt last year. feel Death laughing in my face ever sinceprobably attempt 6 or 7 was last year, lost count when i moved to the city, haven't died died soo idk if its even considered attempting, just hard failing hahaha. havent slept so this will probably be ranting

Got a sous job. felt great, started to feel alienated, hosts werent listening, chefs weren't listening, i just felt over whelmed like what the fuck am i even doing in a kitchen.whatever it's not like they even called my ICE contacts to check on me so. pfft lets die, ok. boom lets go. 

I think at the time I woke up again and just started dying, I just felt weak, like I would probably bust my head on the way to the bathroom. I remember wanting to die, but just panicking bc i knew that this would just end really badly I took somewhere between 2 and 3 hundred pills of zquil,tylenol,advil pms. And all I could think of in the moment was *fuck.* No anti-nausea meds (dumbass) so I start blowing chunks, obvs lost my pill count. I knew if anything I just fucked up my system and it's going to be  long ass week. I remember smiling at whoever intubated me bc I knew it was all fucked.

stuck in icu for a few days, but i enjoyed it. my dreams were the scariest but turned into the most beautiful things after i'm guessing a few days . I really hoped in my heart of hearts that I was at least in purgatory. I wake up to find a friend at my feet. I didn't want that. I wanted everyone gone. I didn't tell anyone bc I really just wanted to die y ya. How did this turn into a whole thing. I didn't want her there or SOs mom looking at me as i lay passed out, I just felt more alone with everyone. Even Sos friend knew, i wouldnt have minded but they stayed over like the next month and i could just feel quiet judgement or at least weird quiet, no one talked about it but his friend and his SO knew. his friends SO said she was glad I was ok before they left after the weekend. Fucking slutbag, idk u or your bf but you both are balls deep in my business ok. anyway..

 I remember waking up again on one to one but I had my phone. I looked up my balance to check my deposits and either my balance was 360 or 360 was missing, I think it was supposed to be around 7something or almost 8. I bring it up to SO who got defensive saying so much was going on and he was worried, MTG games, Beer, Cigarettes. thats where the cash went. He said cleaning but there was still friggin nyquil goo on the floor and the trash wasn't taken out when I got back from the loony bin. call me heartless but idk i was out for a few days and 3 hundo was gone lol, how would it have been if i just died like?

So i was supposed to see a friend after it all, almost died near Katz deli. light said walk and I was inches away from getting it by a produce bus that ran the light, and I felt so alive. now I just wished i took a fucking step real quick. I wanted to think there was a reason I was here, that it was the universe saying I was leaving on her terms or not at all. 

Go to this place to wait, waited almost an hour for my friend to come by while the waiter ignored me which I guessed made me feel smaller than most times. Ah well, still alive. but since then it feels all downhill. Lost touch with that galpal, but we were both sad. I felt like sometimes she did things to make me feel smaller, but also feel like its just the fear of inadequacy telling me that. I do feel like she took me to a dark place that was unnecessary though, I felt wasn't allowed to really have problems. there was someone else who had something terrible happen. couldnt visit or call the loony bin bc she was busy (then why be over me in icu with ur sister who doesnt even know me). But at a certain point I felt like she always wanted to be the little wounded deer everyone helped but refused help bc she was too tuff . She talked about how certain people resented her, and how shitty everyone was, but I feel like she was a mean girl on the low. Like she has called me crying, she has been to my house at godless hours bc she was alone, i have literally dressed her wounds. we were thicc thieves together for a minute then I guess I got too much. Always late to see me, not texting for days, not really asking about me, and I felt like the one always seeking approval, and I felt she liked that bc she also felt shit?. Or maybe she was too depressed for friendship and maybe i'm just a needy piece of shit. Alone now so who is really laughing.

SO has been supporting me on and off bc I can't hold a job anymore. I think a few months before my big job he kept saying how I can't hold a job (idk it was in an argument) and now I really can't.Both drank and argued a lot, think it calmed officially a couple of months ago once I officially lost income for my own hard stuff. Right now he is playing fortnite. Before he took a nap at 12 he was also playing it. And yesterday? Yes. Also playing. We went to the store yesterday and just holding the basket not talking about anything. not discussing anything. he just took time off work to get a different job and I feel like I am good bc I am convenient?  I gave up my lease to be with him and now I feel like it's an obligation to take care of the things he can't/won't because he supports me and is happy with me sometimes. I feel like he's just been accustomed to having a plus one, it's not like a partner. I have no one and no where to go. no money and no income. as unhealthy as we are together sometimes, he is all I have here. aside from immediate family he talks to sometimes I feel like I am also his only friend. sometimes i don't want to die, I just want to go far away so he can develop on his own. He doesn't get"" depression and I remember even throwing a noose I made at him. he was shocked and we stopped arguing that night, but guess  where that noose is? still on my dresser, and we live in a studio! wild.

 I've had 2 terminations and one miscarriage. (1st was bc of my new job which was a simple choice, save up and start, then the second I had been home from hospital for a little over a month, the last one I got a pill to finish bc I was but it was 'gone' already) He doesn't want to be a father (he said yes the last time but it was so scared and hollow i just had to go with my gut and went to the doc for the news), and I don't think we should raise a child who will grow up around resentment. (im a foster kid so tbh i would rather be a single mom but that was a whole thing so) I can't see myself having his child and remaining happy for the next year even. still think what would have happened had I just hit the road and started my own thing for me and my kid, think I wouldve been a good mom.

my dad friend keeps telling me to make moves to get back into painting but I wasnt even great at 17, I don't want anymore tiring adventures.

 It seems so pointless I'm not even sure if direction is necessary anymore.

I feel like I can't find my footing, I'm fucking tired of the kitchen, but i've been here since I was 16, it's all I am. I feel if you're not planning on being a chef, you'll be a linecook forever. while there's no shame in an honest job I feel like I wanted more from this life. I wanted to dream, and I feel like I dreamt too big. 

I feel like Death is laughing at me, and just waiting for me to fully get it through that I am alone. i feel like anyone's attempts to help are meant to sate their own senses of fulfillment, no one knows me, no one really cares.",1

I've got a great job, I'm in school with decent if not good grades, I'm socializing and making friends, I've found someone who makes me so happy I can't stand it, and I'm still sitting here in the middle of the afternoon so upset that I want to throw up. Nothing triggered this. I was walking back from class and suddenly got so upset that I started crying, right there where I was walking. I feel like nothing I do is ever going to be good enough for my own standards, and even then, why bother living? There's no point to being here. In the grand scheme of things, one person won't throw anything off one way or the other.

"A poem about suicideA maelstrom of water crashes down
Pure power and force unstoppable
Trapped, at the bottom
A drowned soul with no escape

An impenetrable barrier 
No sound escapes this place
Screams of pain echo into the abyss
They hear. But they do not listen.

A beast tears away at flesh within
For these scars do not see the light of day
Hidden away, beneath the shell
A facade of a person

Human Being?
Just human now, the Being is gone
Being is all that was him, a kind personality
Laughter, happy emotions, long gone 
The husk of a human

A warm breathe 
A welcoming embrace
A way out is here.

I step into the light

"Well it's been a short while since my recent suicide attempt... But there is hope!And I find it getting harder and harder every day to fight off the depression. I didn't attempt suicide to seek attention, or to free myself from pety problems. The only reason I survived was because the only person I told tipped off someone else who knew my address. Things have been looking up for me and I guess I'm here to offer and helping and caring hand when all the ones I was hoping to stick around left me the day I got out the hospital. But, there is light, there is a way out. I for one view music is one of the best therapeutic things to exist. Fun fact: music requires 100% of your brain to process. Every single part of your brain is used to process music. This means that music has a major influence on anyone that listens to it directly or indirectly. The effect is either insignificant or it can be something amazingly helpful (in my case).

I've managed to fight off my depression by listening and reading lyrics from Streetlight Manifesto. Even if it's not your type of music, at least read the lyrics to each of these songs and I guarantee you'll feel better or think twice before committing to something that you can't come back from.

A Better Place, A Better Time:

One of the best anti-suicide songs I have ever heard in my life. It's seriously kept me from thinking of attempting what I almost achieved.

Point/Counterpoint:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiY-SgAFUUY

Just amazingly well written. The verse halfway through the song is amazingly well written and down to Earth.

Somewhere in the Between:
www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlWFbDpJgyw

""One day you were born and that was a good day. Someday you'll die and that is a shame. But somewhere in the between was a life of which we all dream and nothing and no one will ever take that away.""
Think about all the little good things in life. Times may seem hard but look at it like this. When you are feeling good, or are feeling happy, it's a glimpse of more good times to come. There is always a way to relinquish despair, depression, and all ailments.

The Saddest Song:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOw55BUfcPA
Think about the pain you cause to those that try to help you. That do care about you. Your suffering and pain radiates onto those that truly care. The more despair and hopeless you feel, the more those around you feel.

"here's my debate for why violent video games reduce violence IRL I'm having a debate competition and the motion is this house believes that violent video games lead to violent acts in young audiences, so o figured this would be of some help against the banvideogames subreddit, (it's not too good rn)

most of the time we commit violent acts because we're angry or frustrated, by commiting violent acts in the game we vent these emotions out in the game instead of in the real world, say for example DOOM(you know the drill we all like BFG division). you might say that video games can culture some really toxic people, but speaking into a mic and speaking to a face are two different things, I have friends that literally gang up on me and ban me from their Minecraft server because they were in a bad mood, the next day I had a few words to say to them and they just stood there and let me run my mouth (I just didn't feel like letting them have their way so I did a thing), that's why I think cyberbullying isn't a problem, if you know how to treat is properly(my own opinion, you guys might know something I don't)

i wanted to be a writer; but hey! i am dogshit, i do not have the capabilities nor the potential nor the brain temperament of a great artist. if i felt confidence in that, maybe life would be worth suffering through but this... just seems like not shooting a dog in great pain. i am not religious or anything; and believe that death will be just like sleeping when you do not dream. 

i cannot possibly see myself being liked by people; let alone having a girlfriend. i am a lost cause and do not really know if i should ""just keep going bro.""  right now, when i consider the fact that i might not wake up tomorrow; it does not really bum me out.

**When?** The day before my 30th birthday.

**Where?** In my rented flat, alone, sitting up in bed.

**How?** Can't discuss method but it's painless, peaceful, and a drug-free method preferred by right-to-die advocates. It'll be a breeze. I've had the equipment since July and I've tested everything works.

**So what?**

* I want my family to read my journals over the last year, but I don't want the police to take it. So, I will post them to my own address on the day. They will arrive the following day; at some point my family will check my mailbox.
* I have already written a generic decoy note to leave behind. I've written it in the pages of my passport.
* I've printed my full credit report which might help family deal with practical financial matters following my death.
* I've already registered with the 999 text service which is meant for deaf folk. This means I can schedule an SMS for 1 hour in the future to allow my body to be discovered almost immediately, so my organs will be good to donate.
* I start a job 3 days before the planned date but I only got it to make Christmas less awkward and avoid questions.
* On the day, I will take plenty of valium so I'm nicely calm for the big moment. Probably some codeine too cos why not.
* When I leave my family to travel back home after New year's, I will say my standard goodbyes and not be overly sentimental to avoid suspicion.",1

"I fluctuate between depression and optimism.I know I’ll never get better with my chronic pain and depression. The saddest part is I have no one else to blame but myself. I was the one who chose to have the elective surgery cause I thought it would make me happier but I was wrong. Look at what happened. I removed everyone from my life including my close friends and mom. I can’t even talk to them without feeling guilty and embarrassed. Please don’t say they won’t mind because my mom would be devastated if she found out what I’ve been going through. I have so much I want to do in life and my life is pretty much over because of the pain and guilt. I am also paranoid at all times.

I'm scared I'm gunna push away this guy i have been recently dating (who has so far been wonderful and supportive) and i can't comprehend why he is interested in me, how he can bare to look at me and i almost expect him to cheat on me/leave me for another girl coz why would you be with me when you could be with someone else?

"It doesn't really get better does itSince all I can think about right now is chugging down a bottle of pills and letting things take over from there, I tried going to sleep. 

My fucking family, after me telling them twice that I'm trying to sleep and I need it them to talk below a fucking yelling volume of speaking, visibly sobbing while I'm doing it, still ARE FUCKING YELLING RIGHT OUTSIDE MY ROOM. I ALMOST FELL ASLEEP, ESCAPING FROM THE CONSTANT PAIN THAT IS COMING FROM ME BEING CONSCIOUS RIGHT NOW. THEN MY SISTER COMES HOME AND MY MOM AND HER HAVE TO START SCREECHING ABOUT THE MOVIE SHE JUST SAW. 

I honestly sound like an irrational asshole right now, but I feel like using your inside voice while you ignore your family member having a mental breakdown in their bed isn't so hard to manage. 

The only real reason at this point I haven't just ended it after being woken up is that I really don't want to go that way. When I die, I want my body to disappear with me. I really want to be GONE. Nobody really cared for me in life so fuck off with trying to mourn me in death. I don't even want there to be solid proof I died. I don't want that kind of closure. Nobody let me have any say in my life so at least let me have control over my death right?

It's kinda sad to think at this point the only reason I haven't ended it is that I'm waiting for the right opportunity to kill myself. 

I probably won't hold out for much longer though. The idea that all of this could be over in an instant seems too good to be true. That's what I'm really afraid of. Nothing ever goes right in my life so why should I think death would be any different.

Maybe random chance will put me out of my misery. I could luck out and have a piano fall on my head or something. You never know. 

I'm just tried. I just want to sleep now but I apparently don't even get that luxury.

Anyone can ride on the momentum of success or have a network of supportive people to get into a zone where taking on challenges can become a joy and a high, but for people who chronically live in the depth of hopelessness, it's a lot harder than ""just do it, just handle it"". I'm not sure what to make of their ideas and I'm curious if you could share your perspectives on them.",1
"I've got alot of good things in my life but I still have suicidal thoughts almost every dayI'm a 18 year old male from Australia. I've had alot of great things happening to me lately. I've recently got a loving girlfriend who I've been friends with for several years. I've finished year 12 completely and am expecting the soon to be result of a strong Australian tertiary admission rank (ATAR). I've lost weight and looked the best I've ever looked. I've surrounded myself with strong and loving friends and have accomplished many things that make me feel happy eg, public speaking, film making, volunteering. But yet every second minute of my day I'll think about suicide. I don't know if this year's lockdown, year 12 anxiety and social problems had put me deeper in my previous subconsciounly forgotten mental health problems (I'm non diagnosed and have never seen a psychiatrist) but it's brought something bad out of me. I've alwaysed had this low lying sadness over my life but I never bought into it due to just forgetting about it and living a kid's life. 

However from about the start of this year it's just taken over me. I will be sitting there playing games with my friends or hugging my girlfriend and being full of happiness then it just hits me, these depressing thoughts. I can't get them out of my head and the more I try to ignore them I'm filled with dread and the overwhelming urge to do something irrational to myself. It's almost as if I swap in between states of bliss and depression hourly. 

About 4 months ago I called the suicide hotline to talk about how I felt and at that time I just couldn't explain why I was feeling suicidal with much substance. The lady was very pleasant and she talked to me which calmed me down for a while. She advised to find comfort in family and friends. I have talked to friends about it and they have told me it'll be okay but it isn't okay. There's something wrong with me and I can't fix why I feel this bad. I have so much and am really privileged but I'll still find time in my perfect day to look into my knife draw or off the side of a cliff while thinking the worst. It pisses me off that I have these thoughts while over people go through so much and are so much stronger. Why can't I be strong. I need some help",1

My friends all seem to get along very well but i feel like a fucking outcast, a tag-along and everytime I open myself to people it just feel like I'm playing pitty.

I hate myself. I hate that every relationship I have feels superficial. I feel like everyone has a special someone, be it a friend or lover, but not me. I'm no one's first choice, not even my own, and even through all that I'm too much of a coward to kill myself.

Part of me wishes i could have the courage. I also fear this is just a phase but I don't want it to be. I want to get worst until I can finally put an end to things cause I'm not worth it. I'm human dead weight and I should be treated as so.

Fuck me, I shouldn't be doing this but I hate myself. I fucking hate myself and the worst part is that I'll never change that.

"Need advice for helping suicidal friendMy friend recently had a bad night. It was a party of friends and everyone was having a great time. Even he was, laughing constantly and having a blast. He was drinking a lot, and I mean a lot. A whole bottle of gin. I was throwing up in one bathroom and he was in the other when I heard the ambulance has been called because he's unresponsive. I was put to bed in my room and was being asked the occasional question because I know him best. Just stuff like address, family names etc.

Then I was called upstairs, still pissed out of my mind. My friend (let's called him Jack so to keep this somewhat confidential) was on the floor sat up head down and 2 sets of paramedics sat outside, who by the way were fuck awful help but we'll get to that.

He was in bad place, the worst I've seen anyone. He was crying and telling me he wanted to die. He said he has tried to kill himself 3 times already. He had told his mum and she put him in therapy, which he cried didn't help. He was saying all these things about moving abroad for a girl he loved before being forced to come home. He kept punching himself in the head and the things he told me keeps haunting me. I was also trying to unlock his phone to call his mum but it wouldn't work and the paramedics kept getting angry at me for not doing it.

The paramedics were asking to leave now he was stable and kept giggling to themselves which made things *worse*. More things happened like my other friend giving him some awful tough talk saying he wasn't special and everyone feels this way. And was angry because he said he planned to kill himself in our house, which I don't think is true, he'd never do that.

The police were called and he ran off from our house into the rain. My other other friend ran after him as I put on my trousers to help.
We found him in the rain still sobbing saying nothing is worth it after losing his girlfriend and other things.
The police showed up and helped a lot offering a ride home or to stay with us and went on their way after he agreed to come home with us.

He had sobered up at this point and talked more in detail about a lot of things like his dad being emotionally abusive and being a man's man. And more and more things. I have him some pain killers and we got him home via taxi.

That's basically the main points. This was 2 days ago and he's still not great. I think the drinking brought it out of him but the things he said have haunted me. I can't sleep and I can't stop thinking about it, I'm so stressed. I'm depressed myself and have thought of suicide but I'm mostly fine. I'm so out of my league and don't know what to do. Therapy didn't help him and his mum just cries, his dad won't even listen, I don't what to do to help.

He has hobbies, a degree he loves doing and lots of friends to help him but I don't know.

Please any advice will do.

I don't know if you do it on this sub, sorry, but here.
TLDR: 
Friend has attempted suicide 3 times and therapy and family can't help. And a night of drinking brought him to the brink. Just need advice.",1
"Help.I have nothing going for me. I'm going to college because my parents drilled it into my head that I'm a failure as a human being if I don't. I don't know what I want to do and am hopping between majors. I have no clue what I want careerwise and am struggling hard in classes because of trying things I'm bad at. I'm only going to college on scholarship since my parents never set a cent aside for it; if I lose my scholarship I'm done.

I drive people I love away. Honestly the only thing stopping me is my partner right now, the first healthy relationship I've ever had. Every one before this was poison. I was used, led on, never loved.

I'm trans. Male to female. I have boobs and hips and all that jazz and no one ever questions my femininity; honestly, I get called pretty and flirted with a decent bit. But I look in the mirror and hate my body more and more. I want to just completely destroy it. I can't ever have kids, I can't ever change certain aspects of it. Chromosomes are there forever, inner plumbing is there forever. Not fixable. 

No family to speak of. My parents and I have had an awful relationship since I was really young for not meeting their standards. They were verbally and physically abusive; we had multiple physical fights, I got degraded into the ground when I didn't meet their standards (which was always.) If I ever even was worried I'd get a C in school, (which I never did,) I'd get told I just wasn't trying hard enough, even when I had no social life and no free time from studying. I have a (nonbiological) sister that adopted me and took me in around 15 or so when she learned about my parents, and I lived with her on and off as much as I was able. She's all that kept me going in high school.

Against my better judgement, I'm going to drop a really identifying detail. Hopefully a friend won't see it, but it's important to the story. I feel like I'm less than a dog. I've delved into therianism lately because I wish I had been born one, because that would be an upgrade to my life. I know it sounds weird, bear with me.

My mother replaced me with dogs since I didn't meet her standards when I was 10 or so. She told me she did. She would treat it (or later, them,) like perfect angels, that could never do wrong. They were never disciplined, never yelled at, nothing. Meanwhile, my pill-addicted mother (imagine a 5'0 lady taking over 6 percocet among other things daily,) found criticism in everything I did. I've always been jealous of the dogs, and I suppose wished I was one to maybe make her treat me decently.

I have little to speak of in terms of close friends. There are maybe two people I'd trust with anything outside of my girlfriend, but otherwise I feel pretty isolated. 

I feel my life means nothing. It's worth nothing. It's a detriment to society just by merely existing. I'm constantly depressed and all I do is bring everyone around me down - I've been told this multiple times. I failed my family by being a freak. I fail my friends by constantly needing help. My girlfriend is the only thing keeping me afloat and I constantly worry I'll lose her; I love her more than anything, she's all I have. But I still worry I don't make her happy. I know she'd be better off with someone else.

I've had suicidal thoughts for years and they're getting more and more serious. I've got a plan for how to do it. I'm trying to suppress the thoughts for the sake of her, but it's getting harder and harder.",1

Is  such a lvie really worth living? Working in a dead end minimum wage job all your life? What do you think? Is it worth it? The pay is so low that you cant afford any luxuries, or maybe a few but you will never live a normal middle class life. Its just existing. Then you will need to work till you are dead because you will never able to retire on a minimum wage job. But because im disabled i believe i can't get something better.  Only unskilled work.

It was a good year. Untill Friday last week when I went to a doctor regarding blurry vision in my right eye, I got all the tests done they put a bunch of drops in my eye and stuff and that's when I got the news that the optic nerve in my right is somehow degenerating that I am going to lose vision in my right and be completely blind.

"The world would be better off without me.I’m 23 y.o. from Thailand.

I came from a very cold family. My mom passed aways and my dad left me with auntie. From what I can remember no one ever says they love me. I never get a hug or a kiss from my family member.

Auntie always find a right word to hurt me like ‘you shouldn’t be born’ , ‘I can throw you aways anytime because your worthless’ , ‘even your own dad doesn’t want you.’ 
If she didn’t hit me or locked me up in closet she wouldn’t leave me alone. 
To this day I still wonder why she hates me so much.

I became trouble student as soon as I attended high school. I was a loner. I hate following other student like a group of monkey. I did Thai kickboxing so at school when I get bullied it would go down hard. I broke other student arm and leg. One time after I beat up the bully, I burned his backpack and I cut his hair. How did I get aways with this? My family is considered wealthy and influential so people who works at school wouldn’t dare to give me detention and I was doing good in classes so no one says shit. 

Graduated from high-school with good grade, passed national exam and got scholarship offered by good University but I never satisfied with any of these achievements. I had a metal break down and I needed a quick escape.

I hear this voice that has been with me since I was a kid. A voice which guided me through hard time when I had no one. The voice said that I have to run aways, so far that no one could hurt me. So I did. 

Like I said my family is wealthy so I had no problem studying aboard. I came to the US in 2015 and I’m still here. I recently graduated with Associate Degree from local college. 

But this is it. End of the line.

The voice in my head talked to me again but this time it said these no more future. No matter what I do, what I’ve achieved no one will ever be proud of me. Why? Because even my own dad doesn’t want me :) I’m a worthless piece of shit who doesn’t know how to grow up. I’m a coward who ran aways from my troubles. I’m a no body. 

Here’s the truth

I’m tired.
I’m lost. 
I have no purpose. 
I don’t belong anywhere.
I’m a burden to my family. 

The voice says everything will be fine and a void inside my chest will be full filled. I’d do world a favor when I’m gone. I planned the way out already. Last thing to do is to left this note.

"Words cant describeThis post will be scrambled, so I apologize in advance. I dont know where to start. As of 2017 I attempted suicide twice, went psychotic and became hated after a breakup. I been having homicidal urges towards my old landlord and the son. Everyday feeling like Im worser than Hitler. Everyday I dont see the purpose in living in this life anymore. I have fear of everything and I realized that everybody , all the Gods will look down upon people like me . Im having dreams of my ex and it feels like hell. Intrusive thoughts coming out of nowhere.  Everyday I am in deep melancholic trances just to not feel so bad. Insanity creeps up to the point I question how much can i go on longer. I abuse my body with cigarettes. I talk to myself when Im alone. I think about all the people who took their lives after a relationship ended. I feel guilty sometimes just laughing anf watching a movie. Everyday feels like a unbelievable nightmare. I took my relationship harder than when my brother went for prison for murdering his girlfriend. Love Im too irrational for it. I dont live in reality. As a kid all I wanted was to be happy but I shouldve realized something was wrong when I was wandering off too much in my mind and afraid to be around people. I been over depressed for many years. I reinvented depression and I went to deep levels of misery. My mind for some reason doesnt process reality well. I work as a security guard so its not so bad. I tried hanging myself last monday but got tired of not being able to blackout. Today i was in the shower and I thought about three woman who comiitted suicide and imagined me being thier best friends and making them feel beautiful. Last week I apologized to God and asked him to forgive us all and to put all of us in a better reality. I look at news about people killing and getting killed . I feel like my body is breaking down slowly due to my behavior. I isolate and avoid my landlord who I live with. I indulge into porn and irrational thinking. I go through so many mindsets everyday. I use to live in a dream world now my dreams feels like an extension of my real life. I dont want any advice of any kind . I just wanted to express how I feel. To all the people on here I really want you to be all happy. Your all special in my book. I wish I could take all of your pain away and see you all just in a state of bliss. I want you all to be happy and I dont want you all to suffer anymore. My heart goes out to every single of you.",1

Consolation from my mother, for what seemed to last no longer than a minute, was immediately followed by backing up what my father had already done. The consolation was fake, and I matter fuckall to them except as a product that society can praise them for, should it turn out well. Now I have two people constantly pestering me, people that care for nothing but the prospect of ""having been good parents"", and for society to appreciate them for the good job they will have done.

"TW: Sexual Abuse, Eating Disorder - How can I carry on?I am a survivor of childhood sexual abuse. The perpetrator was somebody close to my family who I still have to see on a regular basis. It started when I was probably about 6 years old and went on for years - until I was about 13. I never told anybody out of fear they would tell me it was my fault, or that I was making it up. The first time it happened he pushed me into an empty room and made me pull down my pants while he did the same. He grinded himself up against me and made me touch him. He stuck his tongue in my mouth and put his fingers inside me. Over time things got worse and this happened on a pretty regular basis. 
It was after he stopped touching me that I developed an eating disorder. I was anorexic with bulimic tendencies. I dropped from 147 pounds all the way down to about 85. I looked like death but everybody told me how fabulous I looked, how I'd never been more beautiful in my life. Even my mom egged me on, saying she was so proud of my weight loss. 
Over the years I haven't really been able to get close to anybody, I push them all away. Any relationship I've ever had has been violent, and if it wasn't my boyfriend would cheat on me. I know men use me for the sex and I let them. I do not value myself at all. I have attempted suicide two times. The first time I took a bunch of pills and my friend made me throw them up and the second time I tried drowning myself, but my boyfriend at the time ""saved"" me. 
Today I am about 6 months pregnant, and of course I am pregnant with a boy. I do love my son, and I guess that's why I'm submitting this. I'm triggered just about every day and I don't know how to continue on. I will not try to kill myself, for the sake of my son. But how can I continue on with life? I'm so afraid that he will turn out like his father and verbally and physically abuse women. 
No matter what I do I feel like I do not matter and I do not have a voice. How can I continue on when I am plagued by these memories? I know I need to love myself before my son is born but it feels impossible. If nobody else can love me how can I? Obviously my life means nothing to anybody. I wish I had succeeded in killing myself when I had the chance. ",1

I cant talk to co-workers. That'd be a terrible idea. I certainly cant talk to my family, they'd worry. So.. I guess if you all are ok with it I just want to post it here.   


I'm 35 years old. female.. can't have kids, never married, hardly ever dated really. I started having suicidal thoughts when I was bout 12-13. I was told by people at the time that they'd go away, that it was just hormones and being a teen. They didn't. I struggle with dark thoughts probably at least once a week, sometimes more than that. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm on a variety of meds. HRT being one of them (which goes back to the whole cant have kids thing. I dont want to expand on that, though. I don't even like kids. Or at least, that's what I tell myself. I don't know how true it is. I'm not and never will be a mother so I can't say I know what that is like.) I'm also on antidepressants, and they have helped me. I probably wouldn't be here if they hadnt. It's like a fence around the rooftop, preventing me from going over. I kind of hate it, but I'm glad its here. I think?

&amp;#x200B;

I live in a small town in the southeast. I was born here, and I moved away a decade ago to chase my career. I've drown myself in my work life since I was in my early 20s. Because if I didn't, I'd bury myself in video games, or books, or drawing, or anything that'd prevent me from having to look at myself. I suppose. I moved here after my last job went sour. This town is difficult to find gainful employment in if you are not a nurse or work for the military. My parents aren't getting younger. And I thought it'd be a chance to get closer to them, plus to escape my last job. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, this whole post is going to be scattered, because I don't really know how to format it, I just want to get these thoughts out. Maybe if they come out of my fingers they won't spend so much time in my head? IDK. 

&amp;#x200B;

I bought a small house not too far from my parents, we've always been a very close family. I was an only child, and they had a lot of trouble having me. When they finally did, I had all kinds of health problems. (allergies, asthma, apparently malformed internal components that prevent me from reproducing.. maybe that's for the best anyway.. I've already had some surgery for this, I'll be having more soon. I cant sit here and say that couldn't be worse though.)  My house is down a long poorly lit road where deer seem to cross every day. I've nearly hit them several times, and I've seen people who have hit them. The road is only 2 or 3 miles long. Every time my parents come to visit I'm worried sick about them that they're going to get killed in a car wreck with a deer. But even then, I know that they're not going to get younger. They're on a slow health decline that will ultimately take them away from me.  I've never really been close to anyone else. Ya know, I may have dated a dozen or so guys in my life. The longest relationship I've had was about 7 months. He broke up with me because he was getting a lot of pressure from his family to have kids, and.. well.. that wouldn't happen with me. I mean, sure adoption or whatever but like I said, I don't really like kids.. right so, I have no idea. Either way that relationship ended rather abruptly about 2 years ago, and I haven't even tried to date since. I gained a ton of weight, I lost all of it and then some, and I'm trying to be healthier, but I'm a depression eater and I seem to be in a dark hole right now. 

&amp;#x200B;

I look out the window and I see the grass dying, the trees dying, the sun not really coming up all that much, the warmth gone.. I see my parents health getting worse, I see them struggling financially and I can't help them (I do what I can, but I cant REALLY help them.)  I mean, its not like the past was sunny and wonderful right, but I had some good moments, here and there. I can't say I've never smiled, or never seen happiness, though its always been short lived. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've always felt broken. Like, I'm not supposed to exist? I mean they had trouble having me and when they did I was broken. So, I guess I've felt undeserving of anything that good that has ever happened in the first place. I constantly find myself thinking that I'm a bad person because of thoughts or feelings that I have, and I'm constantly self-analyzing, which then makes me feel guilty for being self-centered and narcissistic. I've always beat myself up, starting around 12-13, I would basically mentally abuse myself for every little thing I could. My hair, my weight, my grades, my social status.. it was a bigger deal than it is now, but now I still beat myself up for anything I can find. My boss is kind of abusive, too. He says all kinds of sarcastic stuff to me, makes my job a lot harder. But I internalize it and make it my own, and make it personal. I know that I do this, but I do anyway. I feel like I deserve it. I feel like they don't do enough to hurt me. But.. that makes no sense.  


I do talk to my therapist about this kinda stuff, but not ALL of it. Like, if I told him that a few weeks ago I had made a noose from networking cables, but stopped when I learned ceiling fans can't hold weight, he'd pretty much ruin my life by throwing me into a facility. I don't know if I'm allowed to talk about these kinds of things. If I need to edit this I guess tell me. or you can edit or whatever. That's the 2nd closest I've ever come to really doing anything. 

&amp;#x200B;

And.. I mean my life isn't bad. It's not. I'm not sleeping on cardboard behind the mcdonalds. I have a home, a job, I have some savings, I have a fairly new car, and a lot of luxuries. I should be happy. Right?

&amp;#x200B;

I see these tv shows, hear music, etc. Where people talk about being ""free"" and.. it upsets me. But in a weird sort of way. Like, I almost feel envy? Like, often I find myself feeling envious of people who have been able to go through with it. I've always felt like a coward for not being able to. I wind up at the brink and I step away, and then I kick myself for weeks for being a coward. 

&amp;#x200B;

At 35, I've obviously stepped away a number of times. I've come closest when I feel over whelmed by things that are out of my control. The way I've put it to my therapist and the people in my life that won't leave me or suddenly have a reason to get off the phone or off chat etc. when I tart talking about it, is that I'm ""looking for an exit."" I can't find a way out of the situation except for this. But, it doesn't seem to get easier. I've got a few grey hairs these days. Not many, just a dozen or so probably, but it's still a reminder that, all the pain and problems my parents are having and as much as I worry about them, there's nothing good on my horizon. Ultimatley they will be taken away from me and then I'll get to a point where I'm always in pain and treated like a hated stereotype, or a political football under ""the elderly"" umbrella. I work for a company that helps the chronically ill in hospices and nurisng homes. I don;t work directly with patients, but I hear about them, and sometimes they will call me by mistake and I hear what they're going through, and I just feel helpless to do anything to help them, or utlimatley myself. A lot of these folks have kids that pay for their care, that pay us. I won't have that. I don't really even deserve that.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel guilty. Very guilty. Even reading over this I feel like I'm a narcissistic ass. Why is everything about me? Why do I have to make myself the center of everything? I don't deserve that kind of attention. I don't deserve anything. 

&amp;#x200B;

I remember, at my last job, after my manager quit and was replaced by a guy that absolutely hated me, and changed my schedule around to basically put me in hell, I fell into a really deep depression. I gained 30 pounds in only a few months. I remember right before I got the offer for the job I'm at currently, I had finished up with a customer in a really tall building. They had a 9 story parking garage. and I walked to the edge and leaned over the wall, and stood there for a long time, looking at the ground. Eventually, I turned back and went to my car. I remember, what stopped me was that I wasn't SURE that it would work, even that tall.. the narcissist in me also felt bad about having a closest casket, and the fact that I hadn't left a note. I hadn't told anyone. They wouldn't understand. The news might report it, maybe they'd say I fell and people would ignore it and the world would keep rotating and no one would know my feelings, no one would understand. 

&amp;#x200B;

Do I even deserve to have someone understand? No. Again with the narcissism. It was all about me. MY job MY funeral, MY note. 

&amp;#x200B;

I think, out of my entire life, I've had my means ""in my hand"" about 5 times. Anything else has been ideation, research,and bemoaning of laws. Like, I've never understood why people wont let you just do it. I know it hurts people. That's a big reason that stops me. My parents suffer so much and I know they'd be devastated, even though I dont deserve the kind of love they give me, not at all. It'd hurt them and I dont want to do that. But, more than that, its basically illegal. The only ways I've found are painful or ave a high chance of failure and that stops me. Why am I required to exist? What right does someone else have over me to tell me I have to be here? 

&amp;#x200B;

I thought earlier today, like, maybe I can holdon for them, and, maybe after that I can just go. But, I still wouldn't know how, and I'd be breaking my promise to them that I'd try to be happy. Thats all they've ever wanted for me was for me to be happy, and I've failed them again and again and again. I cant be happy, I'm not capable of that. 

Well, I've stopped crying at least. Why does this help? Why would it? I've written notes many times for the same reason. It seems to help? Is it just venting? Am I just a piece of shit thats spamming and wasting everyones time? I'm sorry.   


Ya know, I've called hotlines before. 2 or 3 times, mostly in the last few years. I've had to have several surgeries, and they're taking pretty much whats left of me in a few months. Part of me almost feels optimistic, like, maybe then I can try to date again? The doc seems pretty confident that it'll be the last. (I mean, what else can they do? No ovaries, no uterus I mean..) I'll be on these hormones for the rest of my life, though. Or, I guess until they decide to just take them away from me. I don't guess I'll be in pain anymore though, like, cramping, 

&amp;#x200B;

I had more but, I'm gonna stop. I've dried my eyes. My sinuses will hate me for an hour or so. I have to hold on past this. Sometimes I just seriously wonder if I can. But for not having a way that I know would work I know I couldn't go through with it anyway. I worry about the possibility of an afterlife. I want to think there's nothing. Ya know we come from nothing and go to nothing. Just, poof. You don't feel anything because you aren't there TO feel anything. It's comforting to me to think about that, but then I worry, what if I'm wrong? What if all this stuff about eternal hellfire is real? IDK. 

&amp;#x200B;

Mods if.. this needs to be deleted or something, please do. I don't want to hurt anyone. I'm not trying to troll or anything. I'm just a damned mess. I shouldn't exist, and should never HAVE existed. But.. I mean, like if this is at all triggering or anything like that just ,remove it. I don't want to hurt anyone. It's bad enough that I've let everyonein my life down much less adding hurting someone else to it. I've sat here like half an hour now debating to just delete this entire thing. 

&amp;#x200B;

OK.. I just had to write that. I need it, I guess I need someone else to hear it. I'm sorry. Like I said just.. delete it ifits bad. I dont want to hurt anyone I just needed to write that down. These subjects, ya know no one will let you talk about them. They tell me to ""be grateful"" like I'm not. or they make up excuses and leave. I dont like this either. I'm sorry.

"Completely lost, and feeling empty.I'm not even sure where to begin. This has been a lingering feeling for a little over two years now, and I've finally hit my breaking point. I'm not suicidal, exactly, and I'm not going to take my own life, but I have absolutely no desire to continue living. 
On the outside, it looks like I have a phenomenal life. I'm getting great grades at my university, I've got the potential to get into some great law schools, I'm running my own website that's doing fairly well, I'm in great shape, and I'm surrounded by people who love me. 
The problem is, I feel...empty. For two years, I have been essentially void of emotion. It's all thanks to a girl. For four years, I had on/off relationship with a girl who I planned on spending my life with. She would periodically leave my life, and enter it again as she pleased. I dealt with it because she made me happy...and I never felt more like myself than I did when I was with her. Two years ago, she left for good. She changed her number, she blocked me on Skype, all of that. I thought that was it, and it broke my heart. She didn't say goodbye, she never told me why she was leaving. One day she was here, the next she wasn't. I have vulnerability issues now. I can't connect with anybody. My psyche won't let me. I'm just emotionless. I can pretend, but it's never real. I just...can't feel anything. 
Every now and then, I would send her emails to her old address, thinking she would never read them, and I could vent a little. Last Sunday, she replied to one. The response said ""Prologue: I hate myself and I want to die."" We spoke a bit, and I asked her for an explanation, but she basically said she didn't have the patience to explain it, that these emails were tedious, and she only continued the conversation because she was bored. Since then, I only sleep a few hours every night, because I wake up after having nightmares about her. After waking up, I always have to vomit. I feel physically ill. I can't move on without closure, and I told her that. She doesn't reply. 
I'm at a loss. The girl I gave my everything to doesn't care enough to help me move on. 
She knows that she's made it impossible for me to be happy, she knows I can't have anything with anyone else, and she doesn't care. 
Now I don't know what to do. I've spent many days just hoping something would come along and end it for me. I have nowhere else to go. None of this is anything I can admit to people I know without scaring them. ",1

"Life for me is not worth living anymore, if it ever wasI've struggled with mental health challenges since I was a teenager. I have treatment resistant depression and crippling anxiety, in addition to a few other labels. The suffering and inner turmoil has been constant and unrelenting. I exist. Every day is a struggle. There have been times when it was better, but those times never lasted long and I always found myself back in the dark hole. I've never been married but always wanted to. I've never been stable enough to be a good marriage prospect. My childhood was horrible. Parents are cold and cruel. My dad used to tell my brothers and I that he divorced my mom because of 'us kids'. He broke both of my hands. My mom loved saying how much she regretted having kids. Not once growing up did she tell me she loved me. Zero physical attention, ever, that is unless it was a beating with a hotwheel track or coat hanger. Neither parent has a shred of empathy or compassion. My life has been a total disaster. 

In addition to mental problems, I also have a torturous chronic illness that makes sleep damn near impossible. Cancer survivors who have the same disease as me almost unanimously said they'd rather deal with cancer. It's absolute torment. I haven't been able to work for over a year and a half. For me, work as always been the best treatment by far. I love being productive and having a place to go and structure in my day. I would love to again but I am just too damn sick. My disease is getting worse. I was really passionate about my career. I somehow managed to earn a graduate degree, which is noteworthy because I am a high school dropout. My sole purpose right now is taking care of three dogs. I can't leave them behind but I am worried the pain is becoming too much. I endure daily abuse but must put up with it because I have nowhere else to go. Not only that, but these dogs are the closest thing to a family I have. 

I don't know where I am going with this. Daily abuse, medication side effects, extreme sleep deprivation, not being able to work, running out of money, constant unremitting despair and physical torment from my disease. It's too much. The despair and sadness is deep and just being conscious is hell. I am approaching 50. I wish I could find these dogs a loving home and finally be free to end the misery.",1

I really can't watch myself descend to the point I lose my scholarship and get kicked out of university so I'm going to just kill myself if I can't get decent grades this semester. Say all you want about me feeling entitled or how this is a first-world problem but I'm tired, really fucking tired, and irredeemably broken with no actual purpose, motivation or function. I'm not a good person nor have I ever wanted to be one, so I'm not even someone people want alive in this world. In the end I'm just a bag of flesh and blood and bones so it'll mean absolutely nothing if I offed myself. But then again, I'm too afraid of not existing so I'm probably going to chicken out and continue suffering until I get lucky and a freak accident takes me out.",1

"Wrote this poem about how I'm feeling tonightMind always self destructing;
I've started succumbing;
My demise is on the rise I can feel it coming

Why do I say my?
as if I have a sense of self;
I've been used up, and instead of in the trash, put back on the shelf

Why does anybody do anything?
Why are we here?
Just to suffer, I must admit there's nothing I hold dear 

We all die but who really lives;
I know it's not me;
The only time I feel alive is when I'm in my dreams 

I wish someone would understand;
And that would be it;
Selfish, sick, self pitying asshole, I guess I'm just full of shit 

Father said I cant kill myself;
""Nobody has that right"";
Suffocating me since my birth is what made me see the light 

Family is just the same;
They nod and agree;
Their closed minds have closed my eyes to what this world could be 

I cling to anyone who sees;
The nature of their lies;
But to live in spite is even worse, I'd still rather die

Oh god;
You know I dont think you're real;
Still there must be someone to blame for the way I've been made to feel 

I guess soon I'll know;
What has been debated for years;
God or not, this life is already a hell crafted by my fears

Eighteen now;
I still can't see past it;
My misery decided for this world I am just unfit

It's cliche to say;
This is it, the final goodbye;
Not like it matters, or anything does, I'm ready to die",1

"The thing no one tells youPeople will always say “what if it gets better tomorrow and you kill yourself before you get the chance to see it get better?”. Well, speaking in a logical sense if things haven’t gotten better and only gotten worse for 7 straight years, using deductive reasoning I suppose I believe that tomorrow or next Thursday isn’t going to be the fuckin day that my brain changes. That’s the part no one understands, that your brain is quite literally making you feel a way that you can’t explain, you aren’t given a way to express the thoughts you have and you have no idea why they are there and how they exist in the first place. The thing about common sense is that it’s significantly less common than it should be, you wouldn’t tell a cancer patient that if they fight cancer next Monday could be the day it all gets better. The thing no one realizes, therapists, psychiatrists , family , and friends alike will never understand is that you don’t have any idea how to fix your mind. You don’t have an explanation for how depression got there, you can’t explain why the thought of death is so much more soothing than the thought of life. My point is I don’t expect anyone to understand, throughout years of “talking about it” and explaining a mindset to people I’ve discovered that every single person is truly unique. The way I feel is going to be different than someone else, the things that plague me will always be a very unexplainable way of mental fuckery. If the thought of death is the only thing that brings me peace maybe I know something no one else does, maybe I’ve discovered that life truly is meaningless because evolution will never stop and in another thousand years humans will be considered as dinosaurs are today. Everything is meaningless in the grand scheme of things, a purpose is a social construct that was made to make people feel like every action they commit has some deeper meaning behind it. It doesn’t, we live for a small portion of the universe and we will never be able to leave our mark on anything more than a blink of an eye in the entirety of the universe.",1

"Requiem for a Dream (very long post.)No, nothing as crazy as the movie.  But I figured that title would describe my situation most accurately.

To start out, I am a meteorology major.  It started out when I was a little kid.  Thunderstorms scared the living shit out of me; honestly until I was like...13...But I knew I always wanted to be a meteorologist.  After high school and my first semester in college, I really realized how much math is required (a lot,) and I had second thoughts.  So I enrolled in a few other classes; journalism, film classes,   etc.  But the main thing that happened was I joined the U.S. Army Reserve.

I left that summer (2006,) went to Basic Training and then Advanced individual Training afterwards.  My MOS was 25M, Multimedia Illustrator.  I had always loved drawing as a kid, so it made sense.  After AIT, I returned home, and reported to my actual unit, a Psyop unit.  It wasn't long after that I got sent to Iraq.

I don't claim to be infantry, or any of the guys who were going through the cities, seeing combat and such.  I was just a desk jockey with Psyop.  But our base was fired on.  And more importantly, we intercepted enemy Psyop videos.  I know the popular reddit opinion is against the U.S., and especially our military.  But there are FAR more evil things in this world than America.  I have seen them.

This is not something I talk about to many people.  I don't think I've even told my own family about this.  But the worse thing I have ever seen was an enemy psyop video we intercepted.  It had the usual elements; bad guys hiding some where and shooting up passing humvees, etc.  But this one in particular had something far worse.  Apparently, the insurgents had caught 3 children (approximately 12-14 years in age) helping coalition forces in some manner or another.

Needless to say, they weren't too happy about it.  They were not in some cave, or some hidden bunker, they were outside on a street, for all to see.  They had the three kids hog-tied.  The laid them down in the street.  Then two of the insurgents came up with butcher kitchen knives, and put them to their throats.  At first, I thought they were just slitting their throats, but no; they actually sawed their heads completely off, and then put the severed heads on top of their dead bodies.

They did that to the first two kids.  The third kid had to sit there and watch it all...and know he was next.  I couldn't watch that poor third kid be executed.  Those images of those poor fucking kids being murdered is burned permanently into my brain.  And I can't help but wonder if what I did caused their deaths.  You see, I was pretty much a graphic designer for the Army.  I made posters, hand bills, pamphlets, etc.  They were anything from wanted posters to ""pick up garbage"" posters.  But I can't help but wonder if those kids saw my products, went to help coalition forces, and got murdered because of it.

I won't lie, there was definitely a time while I was still in Iraq when i put a loaded gun into my mouth.  But I never pulled the trigger.  But when I got home when was when most of the self-destructive behavior really began.  I had over 3 grand saved up from Iraq.  So I bought myself a new Mustang, and proceeded to become an alcoholic. (I had turned 21 while I was in Iraq, so I had making up to do.)  It was during that period I burnt A LOT of bridges, due to my alcoholism.

Eventually, an ex-girlfriend of mine recommended I see a therapist, and I did.  She did help out with a lot of issues I had, and I felt better; and I become better.  For a few years.

Flash forward to more recent times.  After joining the Army, I switched my major to graphic design/visual communication since that was what I did in the Army; and I liked it.  Eventually, I got extremely bored with VisCom, and went back to my childhood fantasy of meteorology.  I did one semester of it at Northern Illinois University, and applied at what I considered the ""harvard law"" of meteorology; the University of Oklahoma.

I got accepted, and once I got there I felt like a freshman again.  I joined all the relevant student organizations, etc.  More importantly, I met my at the time girlfriend. She lived right next to my apartment, and we fast fell in love.  And honestly, it was the happiest I've ever been.  But it was a very rocky relationship at first.  She was a southern girl from Oklahoma, I was an athiest guy from near Chicago.  But after our turbulent start, we made it work.  And as I said, it was the happiest I've ever been.

During my second spring there, we decided to live together.  One, we were madly in love; and two, I was hurting financially and moving in would help us both.  But it was not long after that happened that I broke up with her.  And not just a normal break up, but very nasty break up.  She literally assaulted me and threaten to kill me.  I could have called the police and have her arrested, but I didn't.  But needless to say, I got my shit and moved the fuck back to Illinois after that.

But ever since I've been stuck in the purgatory.  We have in the mean time made up, and are friends again.  We talk almost daily.  But at the same time, my dream is gone.  My dream of graduating from the University of Oklahoma is over.  My dream of me and her, (and our dog,) living happily ever after are gone.  And I kinda though when I moved back home, there would be a bunch of girls from back home waiting to take a shot at me.  Perhaps there were one or two, but I pretty much screwed those up with my...alcoholism and just overall not being ok with the break up yet.

Anyway...the point is that I feel...extremely alone....I very rarely see any of my friends or family.  I'm not going to school at the moment, but even if I was, it wouldn't be at my dream school of OU.  And being as I work in a bar now, I'm pretty much getting drunk every single day.  And I am having vision problems that may or may not be related to that.

Honestly, I feel sometimes like I just don't want to bother going on anymore.  I've made it 26 years.  One hundred years ago, that would be a long, accomplished life.  I really don't feel attracted to any other females, aside for a quick lay (which I haven't done.) I just feel like I have no future, nothing to look forward to, and worst of all I abandoned my family in Oklahoma (my ex-girlfriend and our dog.)

Edit: Guess I should included a **tl; dr: Depressed/suicidal during childhood, joined military and went to Iraq, saw some fucked up shit, became alcoholic, recovered and went to college out of state, left dream school due to nasty break up and financial reasons, now hopeless and depressed again.**",1

"NothingnessWell where do I begin, I can’t feel anything anymore. Like it’s just the same old thing wake up and get through the day. It’s hard to explain I just can’t feel anything it’s like I have no feelings. I have almost ODd twice, that was the only time I felt at peace with myself, it was like a big weight just lifted off of my chest. I want to feel that again. I have already written my last note. I made it clear that I don’t want anyone to be sad when I’m gone. Idk when I’ll be gone but I get closer and closer every day. At random times I’ll just get a voice in my head telling me to do it, and after a while I started to believe them. I never imagined it would come to this. I know it just seems like I’m just bitching about problems but death is a relief it’s like your soul being set free, I remember distinctly feeling nostalgic and euphoric. It was a beautiful feeling. When I woke up I felt cold, I couldn’t tell if I was dead or what. Other things bother me like am I depressed? Hell it seems like everyone is depressed these days. Am I mentally ill? Is something wrong with me? Guess I don’t even know. Guess this is both a blessing and a curse, I don’t know when my time will come but just know I have traveled into a better place, DO NOT CRY FOR ME. 

I love you all",1
"Suicide attempt. My story.I will say there is a trigger warning in this post so don't go further if me talking about my attempt will trigger you.

I don't even know what happened, it was such a blur. It was a culmination of everything that has happened recently, a breakup from a long term relationship, moving, work stress, rejection, mental illness, and extreme loneliness despite having many people around. 

I was laying in bed after being told she no longer wanted to talk to me and something came over me like a wave of determination. It was happening. I was already 6 cider deep but I needed more alcohol. I grabbed the biggest knife out of my drawer and headed for my car. I got in, found an open liquor store and got another 6 pack of ciders. I parked at a park near my house and downed 3 ciders. I wrote out a suicide note on my phone and sent it to anyone who I have any care for at all. I drank one more cider before I put the blade to my wrist. I ran it across. Nothing. So I tried again. Running across my forearm even harder. I felt a pinch and sting as the blade cut my skin. The rest was accompanied by screams and cries. I punched my steering wheel asking myself why am I here. Then I saw the red and blue flashing lights.

I was taken to the hospital where I slept, and then was sent home. This past week has been hell. I don't know who I am, what I want, where I'm going, anything at all. I don't know if I will ever attempt again, but in my head it's a possibility. The hope that comes with people rallying around you has faded and it's just me and my thoughts again. Alone again. Me and my thoughts. When will this end? Please help.",1

"Everything is a mess!My entire life is a mess. 

I have a well paying job that I hate. I'm fairly certain my company is going to go bankrupt soon. The writing is on the walls for sure. There have been mass layoffs, including my work best friend who was honestly like a father figure to me. I still talk to him, but it's not the same as seeing him on a regular basis. The people left at the company are all miserable and fear for their jobs. The surrounding negativity is making my depression 100x worse. 

I'm looking for other jobs, but haven't had any luck yet. Found one that was decent, but I would have had to almost cut my pay in half, which I simply cannot do. 

Despite having a decent salary, I can't seem to save money. Things always pop up (vet bills, higher than normal electric bills, car stuff, etc). My emergency fund is always gone as a soon as I reestablish it.

I hate my apartment. I loved it at one point, then awful neighbors moved in and construction began outside my window (There are multimillion dollar homes being built right next to my complex). This construction is literally 7 days per week, 16 hours per day. I can never sleep! It's causing me to become increasingly irritable. I've spent almost $300 trying to buy noise canceling products. Oh, and I woke up to all of the gas siphoned from my car on Friday...

I asked about switching to another unit, but it would be a $400 transfer fee and higher rent. I want to just break the lease, but it'll be a $2,000 fee. 

I don't have too many friends these days. Most of them are married and have kids, but I chose my career. I'm slowly catching up, I don't think I realized how lonely a career focused life would be. 

I also feel like everyone who knows me is always annoyed with me. 

I'm at the point where I don't even know why I bother anymore. I feel like I have no control over anything in my life and that too much change is happening at once. ",1

"Can't stop thinking about suicideSo here's the situation:

Long distance girlfriend; have met before.

I'm her first boyfriend but she's not my first girlfriend. I used to be tappin' babes erry day before I decided to calm the fuck down and start treating women properly without using them for sex.

So this relationship is ongoing for a few years. We wait for ages to tell our parents etc because she's anxious about admitting she's in a LDR with some cunt from the internet and my parents are the same. I'm quite a bit older than she is but I care about my parent's opinion of my girlfriends so yeah.

Always been lovey-dovey with each other sending stupid texts 1000 times a day, sending indecent images and texts at night etc. She is the finest girl you've ever seen, seriously 10/10 skinny brunette. Amazing. Way out of my league.

So here's the first alarm bells; why does a 10/10 girl want to be with some douchebag? Being in to amateur psychology I assume it's because I took her virginity she has that bond with me that women tend to develop. More like she's infatuated with me rather than in love with me. It doesn't bother me though because hey ho I'm a retard and want to ride this shit to the ground.

So I ignore these signs and continue talking to her every day. She's clingy sometimes but I like clingy girls so I enjoy her messages.

I notice she gets busier and has less time to reply to me suddenly. I get annoyed with her after she just blatantly fucking ignores my texts for like a week and then basically doesn't even text me at all for one day, doesn't text me to say she's going out with friends, doesn't text me to say goodnight. Basically I hear fuck all from her for like a month.

Do I sound clingy? Probably, but if you had someone text you frequently, DAILY for over two years you'd start to get annoyed when they basically start ignoring you.

More annoying is that she never has time for me, but she has time to meet up with her other faggot friends 24 hours of the fucking day. Really nice, huh? Sound clingy? Well, 99% of her friends are guys whom she rejected.

So I can't contain my rage over this shit eaters after a while and I get pissed off telling her they only like her because she has a pair of [tits](http://i1.minus.com/ibgbIOyIwQPqXv.jpg).

""NO!"" she protests, ""I can have male friends if I like. They like me for who I am!""

I then ask her how many of these guys have expressed their love for you at some point?

Seven. Out of eight.

So why do these cuntfucks still hang to her ass like it's the last lifeboat on the Titanic? Because of her fucking personality, I bet.

So here comes the final piece of RAGE I encounter just not 20 minutes ago. This morning she signs in on Facebook at like 2pm or something. Apparently she had been ""sleeping"". I had to go work out at 3pm, so I told her. No reply. Big surprise, she just decides to fucking ignore me as always.

I go work out, a couple of hours later I come back. No texts, Facebook messages - anything. Whatever. She comes on Facebook about 20 minutes later and explains she couldn't text me because she left her phone at home, and she was out ""walking"" in the pitch black.

""With who?""

Oh, just her faggot guy friend who so fucking obviously wants to tap that.

The best part is how she didn't see any problem with this and when I said ""If I ignored you and went on a moonlit stroll with a girl"" she replied saying it's ""not the same."" What the fuck.

SO THAT'S THE FIRST THING PISSING ME THE FUCK OFF

""Why should your girlfriend make you want to kill yourself?"" I hear you cry. Well, because:

    If she leaves me I will literally give up looking for a girlfriend. There is no fucking point. It will be the final nail in the coffin confirming all women are stupid whores who can't keep a fucking promise.

    I don't want to be that misogynistic prick but I'm a fucking ASS HAIR away from it.

    Every woman in my life has fucked me over and I have ridiculous trust issues like you wouldn't believe. I can't even make eye contact with my family when I talk to them.

    I have no education at all. I will be working retail/shit jobs for the rest of my life.

    I have the Midas Touch of shit. Everything I touch turns to shit. The only good thing in my life is my girlfriend. If she is gone I have NOTHING.

    I have 0 friends probably because I'm so fucking insufferable.

    Massive painkiller addiction making me stoned as shit forever.

    No motivation to do anything. I have a criminal record which means I can't get a job that pays above minimum wage no matter what.

So the only thing keeping me alive is my girlfriend; essentially an Iron fucking Lung. But she'd rather talk to some beta fucking manlet who doesn't even lift I guess because he's ""SO NICE"" or some shit and all I do is whine like a bitch.

Fucking fuck shit fuck etc.

tl;dr for lazy folk who don't want to read whatever shit I put: Girlfriend probably going to leave me, I deserve it; she's the only thing keeping me alive.

Shit I sound like such a douche I'd be surprised if anyone fucking wants to help me.",1

"I am a selfish person.This is going to be a lot of rambling, but I need to get it out. I am 32/f and have grown up in a really loving family in the Midwest. What I remember from my childhood was being a brat. Always wanting my way. I have always been spoiled too, that doesn’t help the situation. At 10 I was raped at my babysitter’s house by an older man. I don’t know how old but I remember provoking it, almost wanting to try it because I was curious. It’s fucked up but, that’s what I remember. 
In high school I was pregnant at 15 and I remember telling my parents. Being raised Catholic their first word was “we will take care of it”. I got an abortion, and life went back to normal. High school life. No one really ever liked me, I had a few friends but I was still always a spoiled brat. I know my parents love me and want what’s best always, but I don’t know, I feel like I need to learn the hard way.
So then of course i found my way to drugs, drinking. Just marijuana and some painkillers, but I loved how it all made me feel. Like my mind was clear. I was happy when I was messed up. Sleeping around just wanting that sexual attention always.
I saw therapists, doctors. They diagnosed me with depression. I was on and off antidepressants for about 10 years. I haven’t been on them since 2017, just didn’t feel like they worked, but I’m sure smoking weed everyday doesn’t help.
There are two many drug stories to tell, but at this point in my life I have 2 DUIs and my license is now revoked. I have a good job and I bought a house. Thanks to my parents driving me to work everyday and giving me money for a down payment. 
I just don’t feel like I deserve anything I have... I also have a boyfriend who lives with me and he doesn’t drink, and I don’t really either just because he doesn’t and he thinks it is stupid. Even being sober though I still get really sad and worthless feeling. I feel like no one really likes me and never really has.
I never have anything interesting to say, I always freeze up in conversation and and very awkward. People think I am weird. I don’t know where this is going, but I just feel like I have asked almost wanted every bad horrible situation I have been in. 
I want to get along with people,  but most of the time I just don’t like them. I just don’t really see a purpose for being in this life anymore, I take and I use everyone and I just don’t see how I do any good. 
But them I see my parents loving supporting faces and I know I could never do that to them. 
I don’t know... thanks for letting me spill some truth and honesty.",1
"is it selfish for others to tell me to stay?i don’t want to be here anymore. i have been depressed since i was 14, i’m 20 now. actually yesterday was my birthday and i asked everyone i could think of to spend some time with me. instead i sat in my bed and slept until it wasn’t my birthday anymore. i’m tired all the time. i have no motivation. i didn’t graduate high school because i didn’t have any motivation. i still can’t seem to finish school because i don’t have any motivation. i try. the last six months have been too much for me and everything is just getting worse. i had a terrible christmas,  i spent new years sobbing by myself because i felt so out of place, i lost my job the next day, my ex broke up with me a week later, he asked to see me valentine’s day but just wanted to hook up, my “friends” all said they would go out with me on my birthday and only one showed up. there is a deep, deep longing for complete silence and emptiness within me. i don’t want to feel anything anymore. i’ve tried antidepressants. i’ve tried therapy. i’ve tried meditation and every day i wake up and i still don’t want to be here anymore. i’ve never tried to kill myself but i know i want to die. the only reason i am still here is because everyone else tells me i have to be. for this person or that person or whatever the reason may be. why should i have to live a life i don’t want to live anymore because other people tell me to? isn’t it selfish to tell someone to keep going and then leave them to their own devices? everyone tells me they don’t want me to kill myself when i say i’m going to or i try to. and then i don’t kill myself and there’s no one there anymore? i try to reach out to everyone and they always have some excuse why they can’t see me. or they ignore me and do something without me. i feel so alone. all the time. even in a room full of people i still feel alone. i was hoping that this slump would end on my birthday, that everyone would tell me how much they care about me but most people didn’t bother to.

"How do I lose the fear.I got discharged this morning during dawn hours from observation precautions at an ER from a teaching hospital.

.

The night before, I was transferred to the teaching hospital from a free standing ER where I tried to overdose myself by drinking the hand sanitizer bottle in the waiting room when falling into desperation and realizing how bad my life could be getting if I was to need to miss work regarding a sports injury I had sustained that day.

.

During my outpatient stay of observation at the teaching hospital, there was an IV needle in my right arm. I really wanted to just use my left hand to just punch into it and tear my skin open and cause something fatal. But, I was scared. And, I don't know why. When the security guards would continue their prefect duties to rotate monitoring other patients on observation precautions, I wanted to just choke myself with the blanket, but the the thought was never made flesh.

"I've been suicidal for seven years, I'm sixteen.I never seriously thought about it, until now. My junior year has been one of the worst years of my relatively short life. I lost my girlfriend of 18 months, lost countless friends, all because of my dumb actions. My one friend I lost bullies me daily, and frankly I knew I deserved some of it, but not even close to all of it. I wrote a poem about my rocky breakup, and I got two reactions: overwhelming support from family and close friends, and looks of disgust due to thinking it was self-pity. I got a like on it from my ex, but it was deleted about a week after. I know what I've done to earn lost relationships, but I never learn from my lesson, which is why I'm contemplating ending it all. As the title states I've been suicidal for nearly half of my life. Most of the time I never took any actions to self harm, as I have no cut wounds, no damaged intestines.

"Your Bucket List (good intentions)So I'm as suicidal as any of you, but I have decided I want to live a little more before I die. That in mind, I'm making a bucket list, which you're welcome to add to or borrow.

-I've already traveled enough (9 non-US countries) to satisfy my ""travel bug,"" so that's not really a big thing--I have also lived outside the US--though if you haven't been outside the US I strongly urge you to do so. Gives you a lot of perspective. 

-(Cage) diving with Great White Sharks off the coast of San Diego/Mexico. The idea of being so close to Jaws used to scare me, but considering what forum this is, vicious, deadly sharks really don't scare me at all anymore. Hell, I'll go diving with Great Whites without a cage if they will allow me. An alternate is swimming with Whale Sharks. Personal preference I suppose.

-Skydiving. Again, I used to fear the idea of falling out of a plane thousands of feet in the air. Now, the idea doesn't seem so scary. 

-Ziplining-I have done this in Costa Rica. It's fun and a great experience to have.

-Running with the Bulls in Spain. I had thought of doing that this past July, but scheduling prevented it. Maybe I will see if there is something like this to do in the US in the near future

-Running for a political office. I wanted to do this, but ended up moving abroad instead. Don't care if I would've won. Still would've been a fun hustle. 

-On a similar note: starting a revolution (or at least protesting). I went to the March for Science in April 2017. It was very interesting to see so many people gathered together NOT for entertainment or the hopes of buying a product, but for their own beliefs. Before I die, I think it would be fun to start my own yellow vest movement here in the US regarding all the tomfoolery in the US government/capitalist society at large. People would call me crazy, but they'd call me crazy anyways for being suicidal.

-Learning a new language (verbal or programming). I know some programming languages and Spanish, so that's checked off the list.

-Working a corporate office job. One of my great regrets. I would've had fun being an office employee and know I could've brought a lot of energy and new, diverse ideas to a big workplace. I would've been the circle in the square hole (probably why I never found my way into a cubical). I'd always relished the challenge of turning a cubicle job into something stimulating and entertaining for myself and potential co-workers. Oh well.

-Eating lots of delicious food. I have eaten reasonably priced, but extremely tasty meals in France, Hong Kong, Japan, and obviously America. I am satisfied here. 

-I did not include any sort of sexual/romantic things on this list, because sex/romance (or the lack of it) is my whole reason for being suicidal in the first place. And I am strongly against the usage of prostitutes. I would literally rather kill myself than have paid sex.

-Hiking to the summit of Mt. Everest. Would be cool (literally), but too damn expensive.

-Having an encounter with Nessie/Bigfoot/aliens. Always loved conspiracy stuff. I don't think these things are necessarily real, but would've loved to have ""seen Bigfoot.""

-Driving a really nice car. I may consider renting a Lamborghini in Vegas. We'll see.

Remember that if costs are ever an issue-put it on a credit card-you'll never have to pay it off! Anyways, please add to my list or post your own. It can small things too, like having a chat with an old friend you haven't seen in years or resolving an old grudge.",1

I feel as if my mind is breaking at the seams from the continual compartmentalization required from being a friend, neighbor, husband, father, stepfather, distance-father, brother, son, coworker, leader, boss, financier, etc.

If anything else, I don't know what I don't know.  I'm not in any immediate danger but I know these types of feelings.  I've had them before and I brushed them aside until I was staring at the inside of a barrel admiring the gentle slope of the curves as they eventually compacted into a near completely indistinguishable shape.

"Suicide PrepTried to practice cutting myself and have been hitting myself to build up the courage to stop this i don't even feel depressed and empty anymore.

It'd be easier to die, the only way i can open up is by sending this off into nothing that cant help me in my surroundings. One time a therapist told me when i was mourning my friends suicide ""sometimes people who really want to kill themselves will."" All that did was give me hope that someday i could finally do it. It sits on my mind almost every day. I don't want to feel this anymore and bring it on any one else only to hurt them.  ",1

"Everyday I lose more and more of my motivation.I don't even know where to start with where I am at the moment. 

Today, the manager at one of my jobs called me stupid. I'm not stupid, though. I work extremely hard at this job (which is just some minimum wage job, mind you). I wake up at 4am, leave on foot at 4:45, clock in at 5:20 and work until 1:30. I am never late. I never miss days. I complete my tasks on time sometimes better than on time. I'm courteous to customers.

 I've had to learn a lot in a relatively short period of time. I've been at this job for one month and have never worked in food before. I had always had office jobs. Didn't matter, I learned even though no one was really willing to teach (you read my resume, why fucking hire me then??). If I make one mistake they say ""You do everything wrong"". Or, today it was ""You know some people are smart and can learn something after being shown once"". 

I work two jobs. I'm currently writing this at my second job, where I've spent 45 minutes crying because someone called me stupid. I work from 5am to 7pm everyday. I come in when not scheduled and stay late when asked. I lost another job earlier this summer and I guess I just have jot recovered emotionally. 

It just feels like no matter how much work I put in to anything it will never pay off. I'll always be stupid or have the wrong personality or something. I just don't know why I even do it anymore.

I'm working to pay my rent and have a place to live and sustain a life that to be honest with you I don't even want. I haven't wanted my life since I was a teenager. I'm 25 now not fifteen. I haven't accomplished a single noteworthy thing. Growing up people told me I was smart, but obviously that's not the case or my life would have amounted to more than this. 

Recently I came up with a plan, a really vague plan, that I would save up money and move to a different city in the US. It's possible, I can do it. Probably much more easily than I think. But what would be the point? I'd still just be me. Me in a different town, which means a promising beginning but the same old bullshit. The same storm that is my life. 

What's the point of setting goals if I know that even if I achieve them, I'll still be the same walking disaster? I am waking up every single morning and asking myself this question. I want to be in a relationship with someone, only because it would give me a sense of purpose. I don't want to go back to school; I don't want to keep working like this forever. I don't know what goals I can make that are attainable or viable. I don't know why I don't go to sleep on the train tracks near my apartment. I think about it everyday. I can see myself doing it. I feel more motivated to overcome the fear keeping my from committing suicide than to find a reason to not commit suicide.

"Cigs, Drugs, Alcohol and suicidal thoughts.Hello, just turned 17. We live with grandma.

I have been abusing drugs (not as much now), alcohol and cigarettes.

My suicidal thoughts are getting worse day by day.

I live with my mother and my grandma.

My whole life is just an disaster. My father abused my mother when pregnant, my father is gone since my birth and my parents (my mom loves me) don't love me. (well, my grandma)

We have are so poor. We're so poor we can nearly live. My mother is taking pills like it's candy (doctors told her so, I love her) so I don't blame her for anything. My mom was abusing me too until I stood for myself. My grandma abuses me 'till this day, but I really don't care much anyway. Still, it brings me the anger and wrong emotions to my brain.

I tried so hard to be a better person, to do something that it would bring us money, but nothing. I failed. I hate myself so much I just can't take it anymore.

Yesterday I overdosed on Lyrica (10+ pills) and Rivotril (3+ pills) because of the pressure.

Police? I have problems with them since 13. I hate them. Drugs, alcohol all the way.

I'm tired of everything. There's so much pressure from school, family, and everything. I just turned 17 and all the problems that my parents have are on my head. I just can't anymore.

But there's a chance I will go to Ireland to my mother's boyfriend. He works for Elon Musk (proven) and promised us he will take us to Ireland in the next maximum 96 hours. I just hope it's not some lie otherwise this will be my last goodbye to you, redditors.

Parents of reddit, please, be more kind to your children and don't pressure them into anything, including school.

Everyone of you here has potential and a purpose on this earth. Don’t ever give up. Be nice to everyone, you never know what’s going on in their minds. Live everyday to the fullest.

"i'm too worthless to liveI'm so worthless... I have no future. I'm not good at anything. I have no talents. I love drawing and singing and they're the only two things I like and I'm so bad at ether of them and I don't mean a little bit or humble brag I mean I'm absolute shit at them and that's not me being too hard on myself I'm just terrible at it and I've tried my whole life and I can't improve no matter what I do

I've never had a boyfriend and it's so hard to make friends they seem to always grow distance because they find someone else and I feel like I don't have anything to offer. My one group of friends ditched me for being annoying and I've been lonely ever since and I try so hard to make friends. I sign up for things I take classes I go places I try so hard to be social and no one ever stays and no one will ever love me

I'll never be successful I'm not good at anything

I'm ugly and my body is shit and I my immune system is so bad I'm always sick and miserable and I'm always breaking bones and ever since I was little I was always ridiculed for it at school and my mom always hated me for it because it cost money 

And I have a heart condition so I can't exercise much or at all and I'm overweight (not much but I'm a little more than curt) and my hair is hideous and people make fun of me even though I try so hard to dress cute and work on my body shape and do my hair and makeup and no matter where I go people make rude comments

I'm a senior in high school and I don't think any college will accept me because even though I try to do things and I try to get involved in leadership roles in not popular and have no friends so I never got elected for anything I ran for or tried to do so I have hardly anything to put on my resume and even my chorus group kicked me out because I'm sick a lot and have to miss school and my voice wasn't good enough to keep me anyways

I went to an art school summer camp and it was the worst time of my life all of the other students and professors shunned me because I had the least skill even though I've tried my whole life so hard to learn I've taken lessons twice a week my whole life and I have no talent

Even my therapist gave up on me and said she won't see me anymore because it's been months and she says that the two of us just can't make any progress

My sister is everything I'm not she's skinny and blonde and beautiful and she has an amazing body and she's social and so smart and she charms everyone and she's just good at everything and athletic and she's healthy and normal and she's so good at everything without trying. The one sport I was good at was tennis and there was one spot and I was going to get it but then my sister got a last minute try out and took my spot even though she doesn't like the sport and I can't have anything I'm just no good

I don't see the point in living anymore shes better than me and no one will miss me. I've tried so hard for 17 years and nothing has happened and nothing will ever get better. I have such a bad personality and I used to be so happy and it's just sad to see how much I've given up because I try and try and nothing ever works and I'm just sick of living in a world where I can't do anything.

"State of SW: The mod team needs your input!As there have been more posts lately about how the subreddit is being run and about what changes should be made, we’ve decided that it would be a good time to discuss what *we're* discussing and get some feedback. This is going to cover a lot of varied topics, including some potential changes, and an opportunity for random suggestions to be made. 

Before we get to the fun stuff - a few reminders. 

**Reminder One** 

We are **not** a hotline and cannot guarentee an answer to every post or a timely response. Sometimes it gets quiet here, sometimes a post gets buried, and sometimes we mods have to sleep. (We're working on fixing the sleep bug so that it will no longer interrupt our work. Bear with us.) 

**Reminder Two** 

Moving discussions to pm is not something we recommend for multiple reasons. We have a lot of lurkers here that read what others post and are helped by replies to things they haven't posted. In addition, keeping things out in the open so to speak gives others a chance to chime in, to see new points of view that may help them, and takes the pressure off of people trying to help. *Even the professionals at suicide hotlines do not handle phone calls by themselves. They always have someone there to support them and offer input.* 

**Reminder Three** 

Please read the sidebar before you post. It has all sorts of cool stuff in it, and we've worked really hard on it. A lot of the things that we have to remove could stay up if the poster had read the rules and made a few small changes. 

**CHANGES WE ARE CURRENTLY CONSIDERING**

Right now we are talking about how we can improve the subreddit and take advantage of some of reddit’s cool features. We would love to know what you think/if you have any ideas about how we can do this. 

1. Flair. We're talking about it. What kind of flair would *you* find helpful? What would be unhelpful? Do we need flair at all? 

2. Self-posts only. We're considering turning the community into a self-post only subreddit. Links would still be allowed - BUT they would have to be in a self post with text accompanying them that explains the link. Things like 'Click here' wouldn't count, but explaining why you found it helpful and then linking would be. What do you all think? 


3. As you may know, reddit is now using wiki pages. What sort of things do you think would be helpful on ours? Do you have something cool we could use? 

**THINGS WE HAVE DISCUSSED AND WILL NOT BE DOING**

These are less fun, but we thought we would preemptively explain why some suggestions just aren't going to happen. 

The downvote button stays - we can't actually remove it, but we have the ability to hide if. However, it is very easy for people to get around this change and continue to downvote despite the change. If the admins give us a way to truly disable the button instead of hiding it, we will revisit this. 

We will not be setting up an IRC channel, a message board, a chat room, or anything of the sort. We've got our hands full here, and don't have the ability or the time to moderate them properly. Any such thing that shows up is going to have no moderation or an entirely different mod team - please keep that in mind if you find one and decide to visit it. 


**YOUR TURN!**

Now that all of the serious stuff is out of the way - what do you want to see in this community? Is there a change that you think would be good to make? Do you have a suggestion? Now is a great time to let us know!

"I told my parents that I were depressed and it didnt make anything better, only worse, even thought they are supportive.Sorry for the wall of text.

I've always considered myself lucky when it comes to my parents, but telling them how I feel is something I deeply regret. It didnt make anything better, everything is just one big mess. I not an idiot, I can tell how stressed they are. When they feel bad it only makes me feel even worse. My dad wanted me to tell him what's wrong so that he could help, but how the fuck am I supposed to explain whats wrong to someone else when I dont even know whats wrong myself. I've skipped school a lot these last few months. My social anxity is just getting worse and worse. I've often gone to school just to turn around when im there because im almost getting panic attacks. The worst thing about skipping school is the look my parents give me when they come home and ask me if ive been to school that day. Lying is not an option, I hate lying and i simply cant do it properly. They think my problems exist because of my lack of discipline, and maybe they are right. But I also lack a ton of other things, since im a fucking useless person. 

I've become paranoid. I have always been bad in social situations but i have never had any problems with my family until maybe 5-7 months ago. Now im just shutting myself into my room, pretending i dont have any problems with them. But thr truth is that im scared. So, so, so fucking scared. Im afraid of my parents talking to me because talking to them only leads to pain, so ive been avoiding them as much as i can. Whenever i hear footsteps I almost start hyperventilating, because im scared that someone might come home. And it doesent help that we live in an appartment with small walls, so i can hear every single step our neighbours take. After reading stories here i understand that im to young to give up yet, but i just cant myself keep going on like this.

"Today was my birthday Today I got to play minecraft with 5 friends. Here's how that went

1. I played minecraft for 8.5 hours today. My siblings were annoyed because I wanted be in my room alone because I was on a vc.

2. One of my friends used a bunch of slabs to build a bridge from the top of a mountain down to the ground.

3. A different friend gave everyone flower pots with flowers planted in them. I got 2, a Lily of the Valley and an Azure Bluet. He has a very wholesome personality and thats my favorite part about him.

4. The same friend kept getting called a massive weeb by his twin brother, because he would talk about anime, even though his brother would correct him on every small inaccuracies he would say.

5. The same friend from 3 and 4 said ""when you put a pokemon in the daycare, it would make them horny. Who goes to daycare to be horny?"" 

6. The same friend called drowns ""pickaxe munchkins"" and ""angry boys"" when he got attacked by them.

7. A different friend decided to tuck the boys into bed with pink carpet. 

8. The friend who tucked the boys into bed created what we call pride sheep by having every color of sheep in a pen in our home area (except for the one guy in the mountains with the bridge).

9. I was the 2nd person to find diamonds but the first to mine them (the first was flower pot guy in a village chest), and I got to make the nether portal. So thats cool. I died in the nether tho.

"Okay bois, so I need to know if a plan of mine will work So, where do I begin? (From the begining, I know) but, It's kinda a long story, so I will try to make it as short as possible.

So, a little while after my ex broke up with me (Early september I belive) I went to a whatssapp group with a friend of mine and met this girl, who I fell in love with a few days passed, we were dating, and it turns out that she talks about some +18 stuff, and then, my mom (Who is kinda a little bot too much religious) Saw one of those conversations about +18 stuff and took away my phne and almost killed me, beacuse You know Â¨I shouldn't be thining that kind of stuff beacuse I am too youngÂ¨ (Altho my ex friends used to talk about +18 stuff everywhere and got nudes out of a girl once) Also, I wanna make something clear as a glass block behind another glass block in Minecraft: I know the risk of online dating, beacuse you might not know if behind that screen there isn't any beautyfull 14yo girl and there is instead a 36yo guy called Chuck, who will eventually convince you to meet behind a dumpster at 3:00am so he can kidnap you and eventually sell your kidneys on the dark web, butI know perfectly that my gf is really who she says, beacuse we sent photos of eachother very often, we made phone calls, and we even thought of videocalls.

A few weeks passed after that and I couldn't do anything, and I found an old phone that I had, so I installed messenger to it and went with her, why? Beacuse I love her, she is the only one that understood me and she never desserted me and she is the only one that supported everything that I do, fast forward like two days ago, my mom found out that I was still talking with my gf and took my other phone away, yes, she was still talking about +18 stuff but not that frecuently, they even insulted her, something that I cannot take, they didn't even read how she supported me, they also saw one time where she told me to love my body (I had low self-steem) and they made fun of it and they wont listen to me when I try to tell them that she is not just a horny teenager. 

And here is where the title runs in, my mother told me that I will go to theraphy later this month, so, I know that they won't listen to me, but they will listen a theraphist, so when the right moment comes, I will talk about how they are basically judge a book by it's cover so they realise that she isnt what they think, and idk if it will work, what do you think?",0

So I've been depressed for most of my life. I've been suicidal longer than I can remember. I've been in and out of counselling for the past 7 years and I feel I've finally reached the end of my tether. I'm going to kill myself next weekend.

I know my family will be destroyed, I know it's a dick move, but I just cannot live like this anymore, I have no desire to participate in life.

I don't even know why I'm writing this here. I'd like to tell you all the full story of why I want to die but I have no desire to even explain it at this point. I'm just done.

"Suicide at 18I’m currently 16 years old and have an ok life. I am a upper-middle class teen and have it easy but that’s just the problem. My mother has tried so hard to give me the life she wanted and that’s not a good thing. She made it out the mud and worked so hard for her position in society just for me to turn out like shit. I have all F’s in school and have nothing going for me. I used to be a varsity baseball player but I started getting horrible grades so they kicked me off the team. I want to get good grades and I do care but I subconsciously just don’t give a fuck about anything. I’ve been indirectly taught to not work for anything and my mother resents me for it. My father left me when I was 2 and I have never had a supportive father figure in my life to confide in and trust. I’ve been taught to not show my emotions so I’ve been keeping them bottled up for years away from anyone. What emotions you ask? Well, one of the 2 people I have ever trusted in my life passed away 2 years ago from an accident crossing the road going to the store. My cousin Kyle was struck by a car on October 14, 2017 at 16 and died on impact. He’s the only person I have ever shared my emotions with and he was taken from me, and if he was just 10 seconds slower he would have been fine. Now I have no one except my girlfriend but she has no idea I’m such a mess. She doesn’t know I’m depressed, she doesn’t know I’m failing school, she doesn’t know about my childhood trauma I’ve been forced through. She doesn’t know shit about me because I’ve only showed her the good stuff and she deserves better. I am depressed but that’s not really even the reason I’m going to end my life. The reason is I have nothing to look forward to. Everyone’s life ends at some point, I’ve just decided it’s ending the day I turn 18. “ Good morning, today is October 27th, 2022. We regret to inform you all that native teen Dontei Lecue, aged 18, died this morning due to a high speed collision we suspect was due to a state of drowsiness from influence of narcotics. “",1

I just really can’t anymore. Just thought of dropping on the subway, as it’s been quite popular as of late round here, but what about the remains? What do they do with that? What about making it look accidental, going to a bad neighborhood, taunting people, trying to get yourself shot... that’d work right?

I don’t know, I know I won’t do it, but I still think about stabbing my arm or hand, cutting a finger maybe, putting a knife though my head or eyes does seem tempting from time to time. I don’t know.",1

"I just want to be free.It’s been a long time since I’ve felt genuinely good. Lately I have felt more down than usual. My mom passed when I was 11, and my dad didn’t acknowledge how I felt and told me “You’re a SwiftPickleLicker. You’ll be fine.” Now I’m early 20s. 

I had to learn how to cope on my own. I never quite figured out how to cope in a healthy way. I funneled all of my energy into video games. Now I have 2 kids, a wife, so I should be happy, right? But truthfully over years I’ve just declined steadily more and more, and I’ve been no more than just a shell of myself for years. I don’t feel anything but sadness. Very rarely do I feel joy. 

I have to put on a mask on a day to day basis.. and it’s draining me. I’ve contemplated many times, how easily I could be free from all of my Earthly problems.. my wife always tries to help, but she doesn’t know how to. And neither do I. 

The only time I went for help about 7 months ago. The lady told me I’m a liar. I’m a manipulator. If I was depressed I would have already killed myself. I was shocked. It just further rooted in me that people won’t understand me. That I have to hide it. Fake it til you make it.. right? 

Lately I’ve been thinking hard on one thing.. just driving my motorcycle straight into a big truck. Maybe a brick wall. I don’t know. Anything. Will I do it? I don’t know. I’m not afraid to.. I get excited.. my adrenaline starts pumping and I get such a rush. I’m in the lowest point I have ever felt in my life. And it seems to just get worse every day.. so who knows.

I was sent to Juvi for 3 months because of it. It was just something stupid that a friend and I did because we were bored but it turned into a way bigger problem than just that. 

So I’ve been out of regular schooling since February 2018. There’s a chance my friend can get to come back to the school but I can’t. If I even set foot on any school grounds in my county I’ll be arrested. I have to take online courses and anyone who’s taken them before knows how shitty they are.

My mom isn’t exactly the greatest help in the world either. She’s always gone most of the day and I’m just left at home most days. She is also is somewhat verbally abusive and manipulative. I’ve had 2 friends since March 2018 commit suicide and coupled with everything else that’s happened in the past year I am just so scared of the future and I don’t think I can take it anymore.

"suicidal procrastination?I have been feeling suicidal for such a long time, this is caused by depression caused by the bullying in my childhood and recent events. I have crippling anxiety and suffer from substance abuse that is when under the influence, making me happy(ish/er). 

I've even gone as far as laying out a plan on how I would do it. I have written letters to my sister, nephews, mom &amp; dad on an SD card. Stock supply of medication I would / will use alongside a bottle of vodka, but ... I'm yet to go through with, I keep thinking 'maybe it's gonna change', but it hasn't in 5-6 years and I'm tired, every single day I wish I would not have woken up..

I'm kind of waiting for life to take it's own course. I'm engaging in self-destructive behaviour a lot (no seatbelt, substance abuse, sometimes taking more meds than needed, banging my head against the wall, harming... etc). It's just not coming and I feel like I'm ready to take matters into my own hands if it's not gonna happen on its own very soon.",1
"I guess I’m confusedI haven’t gone a day without considering suicide. I’ve wanted to kill my self on my best days almost as much as my worst and I don’t want to feel this way the rest of my life.

"Why...just, why?I do not understand myself at times. How could i have gone from being such a carefree youth so such a troubled mind and soul. As it stands, I diagnose myself with anxiety, depression, psychosomatic chest pains, borderline OCD, overactive bladder and wokeness. Only one of those is speculative. The others are certified by medical professionals. I want to end my existence, honestly I truly feel that it would be the solution to all my problems. People say it is not but let’s think about this for a second. The mental health issues I have will never disappear, they can only be alleviated (I’m basing this statement on my personal research into treatments). The economic issues I have will not disappear unless I become extremely wealthy. Otherwise, my parents and other financial obligations will continue to drain my account until I probably have to go back to having 2 jobs. Racism, sexism, homophobia and more may not ever end, though they can be lessened. The possible physical health problems I have will never resolved unless a magical cure is discovered. Even then, a new illness could emerge. And for reasons I will not delve into here, a cure for cancer, for example, will not be released to public anytime soon even if it does exist. 

What do all these issues have in common? Should I die, they will no longer be problems for me. I will no longer have to deal with such endless struggles only to have my progress taken back by yet another obstacle that life has for me. Yes, people can thrive under pressure and difficult situations but let’s be honest...life does not get better for some people. It can get progressively worse until death. To persevere and hope that true peace of mind awaits is essentially gambling. There is a chance I can find what I desire but there is a chance I do not. There is a chance I end up worse than I ever thought possible. That’s a realistic perspective. I of course hope that is not the case but I cannot control fate. I hate my job, my brain and this world. Death is the ultimate freedom. And who doesn’t want to be free? Can you blame by being seduced by such a concept. 

Another solution is to “hack” the mind. To change my neural pathways to view the world in a more positive light. This will take a combination of exercise, meditation and leaving toxic environments such as my customer service job which is very anxiety inducing. That combined with adopting positive prevailing attitudes can make a huge difference. I feel as though I know what needs to be done but I cannot gather the strength to do it. My job cannot be quit because my living situation depends on it. That brings me to another point. Money may not provide happiness but you better be damn sure it can facilitate the circumstances for happiness. Without currency, I would not have even the most basic necessities one could argue I have a natural right to. I have been in danger of losing my home, bed and food. Money provides the very foundation for Abraham Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, a psychological scale that outlines the necessary factors for well-being and happiness. 

But anyway, the point of all this is that I’m lost. Why should I not just end my life when a solution is not only NOT guaranteed but incredibly difficult to achieve. What is the logical reason for me to continue struggling? Is there even a reason at all. ",1
"What do I do with myselfHello everyone, I'm not really sure where to start. I'm currently a 19 y/o (almost 20) college student and working part time. I honestly try my best and wanting better for myself. I have a couple mental illnesses which makes life on me very hard and being to talk to people even harder. I've been diagnosed with OCD, major depression disorder, selective mutism, aspergers and severe anxiety disorder (I take medicine for it). I have a hard time socializing  and communicating with people. I had very little amount of friends when I was younger and I was bullied as well. I'm just a mess all around and have a very hard time functioning with myself without blaming myself. I also struggle in school because I have dyslexia and trying to do math for me is extremely hard. It takes me a lot longer than most people understand the lesson on that day. All of this with my mom being a very confusing person to me makes me feel so lonely and bad that I think about suicide everyday I live. Last time I told her ""I love you"" or anything along the lines of that was probably 8+ years ago I believe. I never want to give her hugs or say that to her because I don't feel any affection from her and I don't really want it from her. When I was little my parents had a very good relationship, they seem to care about one another and they seemed like they enjoyed being around me. They also helicoptered parented me too and I don't know how to do much for myself. Then just one day when my dad started to having to take medicine to treat his depression and anxiety everything just went down hill. Me and my family hung out less and less, my dad especially didn't seem to care much about me or my mother. My parents relationship went downhill as well and they argued constantly and sometimes would get into very scary physical fighting. Which now affects me today in which my relationships never last longer than a month or two because I'm scared of committing. Whenever I got in trouble with my parents no matter the case my mother would scream and shout at me until I would be crying. At times she physically abused me by punching me and trying to destroy some of my possessions. I never fought back at her unless I felt it was very necessary to do so. I didn't really get a scar or bruises when this stuff would have happened. My is a very outgoing and center of the attention of whatever might be happening, she likes talking with people all the time and seems to like put on a fake face and life when she talks with whomever. You would honestly wouldn't be able to tell that she would be the kind of person that would've done to their child. I work with her currently at my current job because if it weren't for her I wouldn't be able to get a job by myself. She tells me a lot that I'm lazy and that I would be fired if I worked at a different place because the way I act. I don't ever want to start anything with her at work but she seems to want to start it no matter what. The other day I was asking her a question and she then started to embarrass me in front of a co-worker. She told me ""You need to grow up and learn to do stuff yourself"". She always seems to want to embarrass me as much as possible, then she asked why I never talk to her or share my personal life. I honestly try my best to do stuff for myself but she always threatens me that she will kick me out if I don't take more classes in college or figure out what to major in. I'm so lost in to want to do with my life for a career, I'm honestly trying my very best to do good in college but she doesn't think so. She had always told me that I was very lucky to even get into college (I get it paid for because of my disabilities) and that I should be thankful. I am very thankful for being able to go to college but I just don't know if it's truly for me and if so what do I do with my life if I drop out? I don't know what to do with myself because I'm very limited with my life currently. I either have the choice to randomly guess a career I'll have to do for the rest of my life or drop out and try finding a full time job. I don't have any friends or anything that live near me or that I talk to irl, most of my friends are online. If anyone can help I'd be very thankful and if you want a deeper explanation of this stuff you can just DM me or I'll try to reply in the comments. I'm at such a lost in life right now that I don't really see any option to get better other than to hurt myself. I'm sorry if it sounds like a selfish thing to do but I just can't stop hurting. My only escape from this is to play video games or go on Reddit, but even now I'm starting to get bored of that today. Anyways thanks for reading and thank you in advance for the help.",1

"Generic SW titleSpent four months over Christmas/New year in hospital because I was found on a bridge having taken an overdose with a bottle of wine. Now I'm sitting in my car on the same bridge and I feel in a lower place than ever. 

I'm now maxed on all my medication dosages apart from one, and I sort of feel okay for a bit and then drop to where I am now. The closest I've ever came to following through with ending it was probably on the London underground where I tried to pick up the courage to step out onto the track. I was so close the train rubbed my head and feet as it came into the station. After that it was probably being on a bridge and letting go and falling forward but freaking out at the last second.

 I'm diagnosed with BPD and type two bipolar. I'd say I'm on the middle of the scale in terms of how bad my life has been, I've met people who have had just horrendous lives who are in the same boat as me now as well as people who (I do feel bad saying this) have had easier lives. We all take things differently. 

I don't have any PRN because I overdosed on all of it yesterday (I've taken loads in the past. 16 packs of paracetamol was my most painful one. The antidote for that makes you feel worse than the actual overdose).

I'm just rambling now so I'll stop and wait for it to get a bit more dark and then move my car over the motorway and see how far I can get today.",1

I can’t do it anymoreSince the past 5 years I have been suicidal and every years seems to be getting worse. Every aspect of my life is so horrible and everything keeps going wrong. Here are some of the reasons why I want to die: I’m not smart and I’m not doing that great in school even though I study so hard. I’m insecure about the way I look. I don’t have any real friends. I keep embarrassing myself constantly. No one cares about me and I feel so unwanted. My parents prefer my brother over me because he’s smarter and better looking. My “friends” keep treating me like shit and I have to stay with them or else I will be completely alone. I’m not very good at making friends I feel like people don’t want to be associated with me. I have gotten bullied a couple of times and I can’t stop overthinking about all the things that hurt me in the past. I don’t know what I want to do in life. I hate feeling this way and I just want everything to end. I know a lot of people have it worse than me but it’s just too hard for me to handle. I tried to kill myself a couple of times but I wasn’t able to. I had hope that things may be better but it’s judging getting worse and I don’t know what to do anymore.,1

I feel like since I was young that I knew I was going to “go out by my own hand.” It might sound crazy but I feel like somewhere deep down I’ve always felt this way. I’m so tired of feeling anxious to the point of being physically sick. I’m tired of the contest barrage of thoughts. They’re always going. I can’t get my mind to stop. I just want it to stop. I just want to be happy, for once. I want to feel genuinely happy. I want to feel something other than wanting to die. I feel like everyday I’m drowning. Everyday I’m falling deeper and deeper into this hole that I’m digging for myself and I can’t stop.",1

"Not really sure I have any other optionFirstly, I feel completely stupid even posting here in the first place. I've been thinking about suicide for years and years. I've always had something planned (when I say planned, I mean, something to postpone dying for), a next life event to wait for (holiday, college, moving, etc) but now they're about to run out. I don't know if I would actually kill myself, but I'm convinced that one day I'm going to wake up and realize I should have done it years ago.

See, the thing is, I broke the law (years ago). In a serious way. I was convicted of a very serious crime. It's amazing that I didn't spend any time in prison. If you ask any reasonable person, they'd tell you that I should be in prison now.

But I'm not a bad person. I have excuses as to why I broke the law, and I also don't think that what I was convicted of is truly indicative of what I did, but at the same time I don't think anyone could ever justify what I was a party to.

So now I'm up against a wall. I moved. Changed name. Tried to get on with life. I had a girlfriend who I met after the crime was committed, but before the court proceedings. We stayed together long after it was all over. She knew about it all. We broke up a while ago.

Since moving to the other side of the country I have made new friends, have a new girlfriend, and am at the end of college (2nd time around). My life here is completely separate from my old life, which has my family and old friends. My current girlfriend has never met my family, and it's long past the point at which she should have. I can't continue a relationship with her and not tell her about my past, but if I tell her then we are finished (definitely). Also, by telling her, my friends here will find out, and I will lose them too.

I am about to finish college, and to get any job in my field of study requires a background check.

So this is where I am; friends/partners will never stick around if they know about my past, and I will soon have to face the reality that I am near-unemployable based on my past.

I don't want to die, but I don't want to end up old, pathetic, and lonely.

I've read several times that if you are truly ready for suicide, then you should realise that you are free, and have nothing to lose. I feel like in my situation I have everything to lose (and will lose it), and nothing to gain. This is most likely the high water mark in my life, so I would rather go now, rather than in 20 years time, long after I've had time to muse over my ruined life.

Not sure what I'm expecting. I've never had this discussion (or even breathed a word to another about it) before. Thanks for listening, Reddit.",1
"Just venting over stupid stuffHi,

I just felt the need to vent. 

So, I’ve been feeling pretty bad lately, and my sleeping pattern is really messed up. I thought I’d have a shave and the damn shaver came apart (it’s an electric one) and I couldn’t find a piece that went missing. And it’s the only shaver that doesn’t irritate my skin much (I have really sensitive skin) and gives a close enough shave. 

So now I’ll probably have to buy another one, and it’s just so frustrating.",1
"At the bottom of my holeI fucked up. I am a very anxious person, meeting new people makes me almost throw up, when I have to talk to the cashier all I am thinking is the exact words I am going to say. I am just so good in hiding it among friends and family, when they are around it gives me confidence. 

This anxiety has gotten me to the point that my family thinks that I am working, while in reality I have been too anxious and have been postponing applying. I am at the end of my savings and some debt has started to pile up, I have a girlfriend who I have lied to about the job as well. We found a place to rent for the both of us but I am not even in the position to take on rent, let alone pay for the furnishing. I have let her and my family down with my lies and miserable depression. It is funny, because unlike a lot of people posting here, I do fucking love life, there is a lot of amazing stuff I have enjoyed, just the human interaction is what I struggled with. I enjoyed traveling, playing games with online friends and especially nature. I ended up studying for something I didn't enjoy and never took the responsibility in my life to get it on track. 

I feel like I have been digging a hole, and now I am in too deep to escape. I have let my girlfriend and family down and I hope they can move on soon after I am gone. Hopefully someone of the few people reading this can learn from my mistakes. Get help when you need it and stop digging your own grave.",1

they completely deserve the tips, and i always tip waiters/waitresses in any pub or restaurant, i just couldnt figure out the website and my brother answered instead of me so the rider didnt get the tip.

"Unsure of what to do.I'm relatively new to Reddit, but lurking around it long enough to realize that there might be hope for me here. This isn't something that I really talk about with anyone, since I don't have anyone I fully trust, so I figured ""What do I have to lose?"" 

I've been hopeless on and off again for the past 19 years when my sister killed herself when I was 11, and she was 18. At the time, I didn't even think that suicide could be a thing, like you could actually do that to yourself? I didn't have that great of a relationship with my mom, as there was abuse between her and partners, and I have a lot of things I just can't seem to remember fully, only bits and pieces.  When I Was 17, my little sister was put into the mental hospital for attempted suicide by swallowing pills. She was 11 years old. At the same time, my mom overdosed on medication when we were spending the night with some friends. My mom was in a relationship with my stepdad at the time, and her boyfriend ""The love of her life"" was spending the night with all of us, too. And just by that, I could tell something was going to happen. The last memory I have of my mother was her looking out the window watching her ex boyfriend playing with my niece, and her tears would not stop. The next morning, she was dead. I remember how when I woke up and watched everyone rushing around, and it felt like I was in slow motion. I sat outside and I couldn't even cry. The only thought was, ""What do I do now?"" I was completely alone, and have felt so since then. The medical team arrived and asked if I wanted to say my good\-byes. I told them that she wasn't in there anymore, so she wouldn't hear me anyway. Some people I didn't even know showed up, but apparently she had  called them up the night before and told them how much she loved her daughters. I had to go tell my little sister in the hospital, and I can't get her face out of my mind when I told her. I went home and stayed in my room alone for what felt like weeks. I didn't know where I was going to go, I wanted my sister there with me, but due to the laws she had to stay in there for a while longer, especially given this news. At the wake, my cousins told me ""I didn't have to be so strong"" because I wasn't crying. I really wish I would have cried instead of killing the emotions that were growing inside me. Maybe things would be better if I knew how to let things out instead of feeling like a burden with my selfish emotions.  I moved in with a relative, who told my sister and I no one else in the family cared about us, no one called, no one wanted to visit. I found out years later that wasn't true after a falling out with the whole family. The relative sold all of my moms things and built her house she wanted with the money.  A year later I left, and a few months after that, they kicked my younger sister out for doing drugs.

That was just a back story of how things started changing. I haven't even written any of this down anywhere else because I don't see the point. I'm trying to gain more control of my emotions, and letting them out. I just don't want people I know to judge me. So the internet works, I suppose.

Throughout my life I believe I have gained a personality disorder, PTSD, and clinical depression. Just 8 months ago I had gotten drunk and was going to put a bullet in my head. I ""accidentally"" fell asleep. I was diagnosed with clinical depression among other things.

I have just quit my job because they treated me terribly. I have no money, can't afford rent this month, lost a good ""friend"", my dad whom I have just met is in the hospital after having a stroke, and my boyfriend who told me ""Out of all the people, you should be able to talk to me the most"" is ignoring all of my texts and has been for the past week. I just feel like no one really gives a shit. Why would they? Everyone has their own problems, and it just seems like venting at this point. 

Now I'm thinking of suicide again, and there are no places to go and honestly, with how everything has fallen apart \(I left out a whole lot of stuff\), the only thing that is keeping me here right now is my son, and he is going to his dad's house for the summer. 

I cannot think of what to do at this point, because it just seems like everything will be taken away again, and I am just so goddamn tired of rebuilding everything every year. I guess I'm just posting this because I'm extremely vulnerable, and I just want someone to just give a shit. Like, actually give a shit.

Now, I just feel tired and kinda zoned out, my ADHD is already thinking up dozens of ways to off myself and give up. 

Honestly, the breakup was kinda mutual, she has been despising me for small things that add up and I have been feeling pissed off that she no longer shows affection or sex and has been snapping and insulting me daily. I am aware that breakups are not the end of everything having been through another very hard one, but I have invested so much into this relationship in both time, effort and money that I just feel empty now. 

I'm now reminded of how much I really don't want to be alive (something that I rarely ever think because I stop myself whenever I catch it) and how shit I am as a person. Everything that I was depressed about in the past just came surging back. It's not like she was the only thing that made me happy, but she was something I could look forward to everyday and feel completely comfortable being around. Now, Gaming doesn't make me happy, my friends dont make me happy, not even sex makes me happy anymore.

I am not an incel in any way, I realize I fucked up in the relationship and I should move on. The issue is that I dont see the point of moving on anymore. I think I am just happy being depressed and suicidal until one day, I finally am brave enough to actually do it. Please help

Most of them are also at least a few years older than me, which I think kinda helps in whatever twisted way it does. They're at least a little more interesting.

I've never been like other kids my age, and I know the kids who say that are always the ones who are exactly like the other kids their age, but I've really always been different, and I've always been really good at hiding the fact that I'm different. I read a lot. Books, essays, poetry and articles in The Economist and Foreign Policy, about things I at least find vaguely interesting for a while (Until I realise I haven't got anyone to discuss them with). I listen to a ton of indie rock bands, then I get a little upset when none of my friends in real life really want to hear about how great I thought this album by some band they've never heard of and aren't interested in hearing of was. I don't even act awkward about it, I just avoid things I really want to talk about and let them have a fun time instead of having everyone be miserable and me look like I live under a blissfully unaware rock. I even pretend being interested in things they like so as to not be alone, but it really makes me feel more alone than ever. I really don't like Katy Perry or the Hunger Games very much, to tell you the truth :I

I play a lot of instruments. I write sometimes. I paint and draw. I don't usually show anyone, and if I do it's internet friends, and I know they sugar coat everything because I'm the youngest out of them all.

I have an older sister who's really concerned about my social life. She once seriously asked me if I was planning on shooting up my school. (Note: I'm not and never will be, FBI, just highlighting my desolation here). The kids at school all like me, they really do, but they're terribly uninteresting. I stopped going to school in January and started seeing a psychiatrist (Says I have anxiety), being homeschooled, etc. I've only talked to a handful of people from school since. My sister told me that I'll be able to find people to relate to eventually, and that I need to keep my chin up and blah blah blah, but I'm not seeing it. I got bored of the routine and every day being the same, but being out of school hasn't been much (Or any?) better. I don't know. 

It gets awful lonely. I got a puppy to keep me company. I named her after Holden's little sister in The Catcher in the Rye. I can't talk to a dog. I don't know why I thought this would be a good idea whatsoever, but I like Phoebe anyway.

I don't really know how I'm going to get through the agony of having absolutely nothing to do these next few months. I'm going to try to be a little more uppity if I make it to August, but I don't know. Even then I'll only be dragging myself along.

I don't really feel like anyone cares much for me. I don't really let people care much for me. I can be a pretty ugly person when I'm feeling down, and I don't let just anyone see the part of me that's not faking being interesting. So I'm pretty much only a brat to the people I really like and can actually have good conversations with. You can imagine how this goes. 

I know you're all going to say “Oh, internet stranger, I care about you!!,” but come on. You say that to everyone, and you know it!

I've only done stupid stuff to try to die. Drank a bottle of Wite-out, swallowed a bunch of pain meds- Nothing I really expected to kill me, but I was still pretty disappointed when they didn't.  

Everything I do is just to pass the time, really. That's why I lurk reddit for a few hours a day and learned how to play the guitar. 

I don't know. I'm not really sure of anything. I don't know what to do. I don't really like being alone. I'm going to regret posting this in the morning.

I didn't mention it earlier but my psychiatrist doesn't know I'm suicidal, or anyone else for the matter, except one internet friend who I'm having a falling out with at the moment and am not sure if I'll ever speak to him again. Not up to me this time. We always have little arguments that always end in us acting like we like each other a lot again, but it went pretty far this time and I don't know. Not up to me.

But yeah. Just wanted to add that. She's never really asked about it because she doesn't really care, because her job is to make me want to go to school again, not to make me happy forever (since that's all my parents are interested in, so they can have a happy and normal looking family without a socially awkward daughter and lalalala)

also this is a throwaway, because I don't really want reddit to know I'm some little 13 year old maggot",1

"The Universe forcing you to die? [vent?]I apologise if this is the wrong sub, I just need somewhere to voice my thoughts.
Does anyone else feel like the universe/god needs them to die? Personally I've felt this on and off for over a year now, probably. I was supposed to die on Sunday alongside my best friend who feels the same. I was too tired, she gave up and got admitted to the hospital. So now I'm alone, and alive. The universe is getting more insistent however and I know God needs me with Him. I'm not religious however, I don't know if he even loves me. I'm an extremely awful person and I'm not deserving of His love at all. he knows this. he knows this so i don't know why he's so urgent. Is god even allowed to accept sinners? I suppose I can't help it though, I'm not human. I don't know what i am but this is just an awful, temporary form. this life has always been such suffering for me and im so tired of walking among lower beings. Anyway i don't know what this was, i apologise. Perhaps a vent? I've been so trapped in my own head lately. I just want to ascend but i can't leave without her, so for now I will suffer and wait. I appreciate this outlet. I'm thinking of killing myself on November 1st. it just feels right to me? November has always been a lovely cherry blossom pink and maybe that's why i didn't die on Sunday, God is giving me a last chance. I will take it. I'll be among the stars, happy and at peace, finally. Yes :) I wish you all peace on this Earth.",1

"I'm feeling suicidal and need supportI'm feeling an overwhelming desire for self annihilation. I'm trying to reach out before this gets any worse. I'm privileged enough to have support within my community--family, friends, and healthcare professionals. Unfortunately there are few people that I talk to who can relate to my situation.

6 years ago I lost my ability to sleep. It took five years to find the right medication that had minimal side effects. Though my insomnia is under control I still regularly deal with depression and anxiety.

I think the depression stems from being thus far unable to be a productive member of society. That is to say that I haven't been able to finish my bachelor's degree or hold a job longer than two months in many years. I have a deep desire to simply be like most other people who are highly effective and able to give back to their community.

For as long as I can remember I've often had this heavy brain fog that makes it very difficult to process information and manage my life in a meaningful way. It also makes learning a new job quite difficult. Sometimes I feel like I have a broken brain.

I've had some short term success in numerous jobs--call centers, factories, restaurants, specialized work, tutoring math, sales, et cetera. However, these jobs are usually sabotaged by emotional turmoil or my inability to manage my life outside of work.

I used to play a lot of chess, dance, socialize, and draw. Lately my hobbies are of little interest to me, other than writing occasionally. Some days I'm inspired and feel as though I can be successful and maintain a social life. Other days the brain fog is so heavy that I hibernate and avoid commitments.

I do have some healthy coping skills and have learned a lot about my strengths and weaknesses amidst my mental health issues. Even though I'm painting a pretty grim picture it's important to note that my life isn't always full of pain. I've travelled the country in ways few people have the chance to experience. I've had long stints of feeling happy, healthy, and strong. I've been able to share my talents with people in need. But what can someone do with such fickle emotions in the long term?

I'm wondering how to achieve lasting inner peace. I've studied eastern philosophy--and it makes a lot of sense to me--but if I do have a broken brain then how can I live with that? If I can't be an independent member of society then what am I supposed to do?

The last thing I want to do is break the hearts of those who love me by offing myself, but something's got to give. My desire to be free of all this has been growing lately. Does anyone have any insight for me?",1

"Posting Galadrielâ€™s opening monologue every day until I get a girlfriend Day 3 Galadriel: (speaking partly in Elvish)

(I amar prestar aen.)

The world is changed.

(Han matho ne nen.)

I feel it in the water.

(Han mathon ned cae.)

I feel it in the earth.

(A han noston ned gwilith.)

I smell it in the air.

Much that once was is lost, for none now live who remember it.

It began with the forging of the Great Rings. Three were given to the Elves, immortal, wisest and fairest of all beings. Seven to the Dwarf-Lords, great miners and craftsmen of the mountain halls. And nine, nine rings were gifted to the race of Men, who above all else desire power. For within these rings was bound the strength and the will to govern each race. But they were all of them deceived, for another ring was made. Deep in the land of Mordor, in the Fires of Mount Doom, the Dark Lord Sauron forged a master ring, and into this ring he poured his cruelty, his malice and his will to dominate all life.

One ring to rule them all.

One by one, the free lands of Middle-Earth fell to the power of the Ring, but there were some who resisted. A last alliance of men and elves marched against the armies of Mordor, and on the very slopes of Mount Doom, they fought for the freedom of Middle-Earth. Victory was near, but the power of the ring could not be undone. It was in this moment, when all hope had faded, that Isildur, son of the king, took up his fatherâ€™s sword.

Sauron, enemy of the free peoples of Middle-Earth, was defeated. The Ring passed to Isildur, who had this one chance to destroy evil forever, but the hearts of men are easily corrupted. And the ring of power has a will of its own. It betrayed Isildur, to his death.

And some things that should not have been forgotten were lost. History became legend. Legend became myth. And for two and a half thousand years, the ring passed out of all knowledge. Until, when chance came, it ensnared another bearer.

It came to the creature Gollum, who took it deep into the tunnels of the Misty Mountains. And there it consumed him. The ring gave to Gollum unnatural long life. For five hundred years it poisoned his mind, and in the gloom of Gollumâ€™s cave, it waited. Darkness crept back into the forests of the world. Rumor grew of a shadow in the East, whispers of a nameless fear, and the Ring of Power perceived its time had come. It abandoned Gollum, but then something happened that the Ring did not intend. It was picked up by the most unlikely creature imaginable: a hobbit, Bilbo Baggins, of the Shire.

For the time will soon come when hobbits will shape the fortunes of all.",0

"I've held on for 8 long years...The first time I felt suicidal.. I was 20. I came from a very poor family and the cycle of poverty seemed to be continuing. I never cared about an education so i cut class and never listened to anyones advice. My family ended up homeless and we had to stay with a friend of the family. No money. Living off what the goverment could provide. Back then I had some hope. I got my GED and by coincidence I found  a part time job. I moved in with my aunt who's financial situation was a little better and we helped each other get up on our feet. I worked really really hard and managed to become a manager. This came at the sacrifice of my social life. I became distant to everyone and only focused on work. After awhile, me and my aunt became tired of each other. One thing lead to another and she kicked me out of her home. By this time I had some money saved so i managed to find a room for rent and that is where I am now as I write this. That was two years ago.

Last week, I made a big mistake at work and now I'm going to loss my job. I worked 8 years to reach this point and none of it mattered. I never thought something like this could happen. Even though I spent so long doing this job, I know that even on a resume, it wont mean anything. I cant find a job where I make as much as I did so from here it's all down hill.

I have been online for days wanting to kill myself. Reading all the reddits and studies and everything I could find. 

I have to die. I really can not do this anymore. 
Spending another 8 years to get back to where I am now fills me with ultimate dread. 

I think that I'm going to hang myself. If not then I will need to find a way to get a gun. I have to end this pain.

"Friend needs help and it's all on meTL;DR: Friend is suicidal. I’ve kept her going the past few years and we’re doing really badly. Help. Please.

We're running out of options and time. Since high school, my friend has been depressed/anxious with trust issues. It got worse, and even day by day it seems to go downhill. She’s been self-harming and suicidal for at least a couple years. I'm the single person she trusts and she tells some very dark things to me which I can do nothing about except listen and reassure her, distract her, get her through the night till she decides to go to sleep. But holy shit, it's hard. Exhausting. I can't even imagine how it must be for her. 

She's finally seeing a therapist for the past year (after a chain of shit counselors) but refuses to open up about the real problems to this woman (skirting around the issues if not outright lying, plus skipping pills days at a time) and isn’t making much progress. Then after that she'll come back to me and tell me the things she SHOULD be telling the therapist (not just ranting about her day... it's the dark stuff). It has been affecting me really badly, but whenever I tell her to tell the professional, she’ll be back the next week like fucking clockwork going into her horrifying monologues (never actually threatening to go through with it, but she definitely has these constant unhealthy thoughts and feelings). 

At this rate, she really will kill herself (I feel like with her recent birthday, we’ve passed some sort of deadline or marker or signal). I’ve asked so many people for help in the past few years and gotten absolute fuck-all. I’m desperate and insane and I hate to say it, but I don’t want to hear it anymore. It makes me feel terrible things about her but I REFUSE to let myself think that way because it isn’t her fault. Is it possible that the things she says are true: there’s really some people who just can’t be helped? I just need somebody who can actually understand (rather than nod their head and feel bad for me and angry at HER). Thank you for taking the time to read this and comments are appreciated. 

EDIT: Also, what do I do if she starts saying that she really will do it? I'm worried I won't see the line between what she says now, and what she may say if it gets to the point where she's about to go through with it. I'm hoping to get advice on how to keep it from getting to that point, though.

EDIT 2: I just wanted to point out that I still do have hope for her recovery. It'll be hard of course, but I think she can overcome it with help. I just have no idea what to do anymore, and it's gotten so bad, which is why I've come here.

"I would rather enjoy help. If you are so kind as to provide it. So here's my problem. Last night I was eating popcorn when a piece gets stuck IN MY GUMBS. The stuff that holds your teeth.

It wont get out. I've made my gumbs bleed trying to remove it. I ALLMOST got it out but then my tongue accidentally shoved it back in the hole. 

I've ripped a small part of it off but theres still a lot in there. 

This is the biggest piece of popcorn kernal I've seen. It's super deep in. 

It's back to back on my teeth and my gumbs. 

Anyone got tips for removal?",0

I don’t want to dump all of my problems on someone but I’m at the point where I can’t co’p anymore. I can’t afford therapy and I don’t know what to do.

"I am scared.I’m scared of how many times I thought about suicide yesterday. 
Can I give you some background to my current situation (since March 15)? I have been working full time while also taking care of my toddler. He is almost 17 months old. 
It’s an impossible task to work full time and try to take care of my LO. if you have no concept of this, set a timer for 20 mins to go off for the next 13 hours. But the timer also needs to go off at 5, 7, and 10 min intervals because the wrong video is on, the food is now cold, I want this thing I can’t have, I want your undivided attention, teething, time for a nap, etc etc. 
I worked for 5 weeks, started having debilitating panic attacks and suicidal thoughts. (I have anxiety and depression but it has been in check outside of this pandemic). 
I took 3 weeks off of work. Panic attacks stopped almost immediately, suicidal thoughts gone. I felt like a great mom and wife while I was off. It was magical in comparison. 

I started back at work 2 weeks ago and I’m already back to panic attacks and suicidal thoughts. The workload is INSANE. Even in office this workload would be nuts, but obviously more manageable. I work with clients on the issues they have with a web application we offer. The work sits in my head like a building timer and then the sensory overload of my teething toddler screaming just makes me snap into a panic attack. He’s cutting his 5th tooth since 03/15. 
The daycare (through my work) has given us no indication of a re-open date. Then someone delivered via the grapevine that the daycare may not be reopening at ALL as our company was recently acquired by a new larger company, new company “doesn’t want to take on the cost of the daycare”. 


I really scared myself yesterday. It’s never felt so real.. 
There I was, hiding in my shower, crying, googling the Suicide prevention hotline. 
I wouldn’t call it because, well, fear and shame. Would cops show up until someone came to get my son and they cart me off to my local mental health facility? Would I always be labeled with this tag of someone who can’t be trusted to take care of their own child? My kid can’t even sleep at night without me how am I supposed to just abandon him?

Should I have called that line? What do I do? I can’t keep on at this rate, I am genuinely scared of what could come from this. 

I could quit my job, theoretically... isn’t that a horrible idea considering I should be thankful I have a job with so many millions of Americans out of work? 
I can ask for more time off, I know I NEED to do this, but there is some stupid nagging voice in my head that is afraid to. I need to just tell my boss that I’m back here...

I hope you all can find peace in letting god deal with all your problems.. and hope that he covers for your checking out of what was being made of me. And not who I was to literally anyone else who wasn’t a complete asshole or being made to look like one. None of you have to care. That’s the point you let go and let god deal with lol your misjudged opinions and lack of understanding to who what and when sehome was for me.. and to a lesser extent no the people I cared about.

"My life is genuinely ruinedToday, on April 28th, 2017, I came to understand the darkness of humanity. 

Let me give some context. I am currently a junior in high school a 4.3 GPA (4 with honors scale), 35 Comprehensive ACT with writing, and extensive extra-curricular activities. I am aiming for ivies or equivalent and all portions are extremely essential. My parents (asians, surprise) also hold extremely high expectations for me. Personally I hold myself in high regard, has a pretty big ego but doesn't abhor it, and am a stubborn person in holding my views.

Throughout my junior year I dedicated countless hours to a music honor society and a language honor society. I was an officer for both and did my best to win officers of both over in order to gain an advantage in the election that was decided recently. Both results came out today.

My extracurricular activities were absolutely destroyed. 

Language Honor Society Officer Position: Gone. The election was an absolute mess. The senior officers and sponsors had the ability to add 5 votes and 10 votes respectively to candidates they wanted. Despite finding this absolutely unjust, I was in no position to protest as I needed to maintain a good image. The ""honor society"" was not honorable at all, the election system varied from year to year to benefit the candidates the sponsors liked and hated, and possibly due to my personality this past year they decided to cut me off by implementing this system. Last year because it was 1 vote for everyone I got elected, but this year they changed it drastically.

Music Honor Society Officer Position: Absolutely undermined me. I was putting in more work than all other officers AND members, and they gave me the position of secretary. Presidents were individuals that probably helped out in events once or twice a year, while I was basically there for all events the society held. The election system is absolutely hidden from the public, decided by senior officers and the sponsors. I genuinely don't know what went wrong here. The sponsors couldn't stop thanking me after every event, the senior officers liked me, and left hints to leave the society in my hands. The disparity crushed me.

I honestly don't know where to go from here. I almost no longer had any form of extra-curricular leadership and my plan for my whole high school career is ruined. I don't know if I should seek justice, quit the societies, or just give up entirely. I'm leaning towards the last option. I feel like I've been made a fool of: I spent so much time for nothing.

As for those of you that are about to comment down about how I still have hope left in college apps, don't. All those that have been promoted to the position I deserved have equivalent or higher GPA's than mine and now have better activities than I do.

Earlier in the year I went for a leadership position for my school's iGEM team and got my least desired position. I fail to perform well at many of my best subjects. My life is falling apart.

I consider myself one that is extremely self-aware and often force myself to express my emotions with words (the equivalent of channeling one's anger into physical force at a gym). This is what came out. I think usually I put my expectations for myself as too high for everything, but this the last straw, one that I consider to be unjust. People often say that giving up is the easiest and you don't fail from falling down but from staying down, but I don't know how to climb back up or if I truly can.",1

"I really can't do this anymore. I've never felt so alone...I was going to wait until the right moment, until my family were in a place that losing me wouldn't be as hard on them as it will be now but I really don't think I'm able to. This past year has just been too much, and it just doesn't stop. It never fucking stops.

It's been in the back of my head for around 8 years now that I'd wait until my parents passed before I decided to do anything, I already was never able to make them proud, didn't need give them a dead son also.
Last year both of them passed, my mum a year ago tomorrow and my dad just before Christmas. Coupled with the fact that my 5 year relationship ended when my ex told me she no longer loved me, around the time of my mum.
I sold off practically everything I owned just so I could move country to be with her because why not? I was convinced that was finally my chance to be happy, for my family to know I was doing well. It's the only place I ever truly felt at home. Admittedly there was a fair few bad moments but it was the happiest I've ever been.
I procrastinated for a few months with moving back to my home country, she was sympathetic about the situation with my mum and we were/are on friendly terms. I convinced myself it was the right thing to do since I could help her through the summer (she has MS), whilst hoping she'd somehow feel something for me again.
After exhausting what little money I had left I finally had to go ""home"". My dad picked me up that night and we talked a little on the drive back, several hours later I was in the hospital with a doctor sitting across from me explaining how they ""did everything they could"". I've still not properly grieved either death tbh, I just can't. Struggled to get through December so by the end of it I headed back home (to my ex) for a bit, I still had to ship over my PC anyway.
I'm finally back in my home country for good, living in my parents house with my two younger siblings, struggling to cope with the situation. I didn't even get to have a proper goodbye with my ex because we were too fucking stupid to accept what was happening. I didn't even get to cuddle my cat one last time. It's killing me that that's the way it had to end.

It's all just taken too much of a toll on me. After trying so many different meds and nothing working, just bottling everything up inside and trying to cut myself emotionally, it's just not going to ""work anymore"". I don't have it in me to fight for anything when I've got absolutely nothing, no reason to keep myself going.
I did try to convince myself to stick around until my Gran had finally passed and I knew I had the money to pay for anything once I'm gone so my family didn't have to worry but I'm not sure it's gonna happen. I feel like such a selfish piece of shit for it because I know they definitely can't afford paying off yet another funeral so fucking soon after the others. Maybe I'll just make sure they can't find me.

I'm really sorry for the wall of text and the rambling. I know I've got no reason to complain as so many have it worse off but I just had to get something out there. I get that a lot of it must be kinda vague and shit, I'm exhausted from crying and haven't really thought this through much. I'm just gonna end the post here, sorry.",1
"Am I a bad person for doing this?So I've been experiencing these thoughts for a few years now but only in the past few weeks have I given actual consideration and feel almost ready for it. I've been talking to the Suicide Helpline for help and I feel like I'm doing something wrong.



TBH, a lot of my problems stem from the fact I've been alone my whole life and have never experienced another person in the form of a relationship. When I call I like talking to a woman  because I just feel more comfortable and I can feel like what it's like to talk about my problems to one. When I end my calls, they ask if there's anything else and for me the most difficult part of the conversation comes because I ask her if I could just hear her say ""I love you, _____"". I know it's pathetic, but I don't get to hear that ever and even though I know it's not genuine at all, it does help. A little at least.


The most recent one ended with me asking that and I caught her by surprise. She just paused and said ""Uhhhhh..... we all love you here and are rooting for you!"" 


I feel really bad for asking that now and it's been on my mind since it happened. I know I made her uncomfortable and I can't believe I'm being so self centered that I've been asking to hear that sentence.

"Really freaking out tonight - past issues and constant anxiety. A need to confess all I have done before moving on.So I'm in my mid 20's. I've done a few taboo things in the past but have brought no mental or physical harm to a human being.

Just as I feel that I've put the past behind me, the anxiety comes - you know that feeling; like you're about to lose your mind, like a thermometer creeping up to 100 degrees and about to explode. 

My birthday is in a few days and I don't want to spend it worrying about all the same shit I worry about every day. I'm losing my sense of self regardless of the fact I already suffer from depersonalisation. How the fuck could I sink further than that?

I have tried self forgiveness. I would love to just wipe the slate clean and say, ""right, from here, forget everything. Move on,"" and not think about it all again.

But I can't. I feel like a fake piece of shit in my own family. I feel as if they would disregard me like a piece of garbage if they knew the shit I've done. Realistically they probably wouldn't. They love me to bits. But I'm drifting away from them, feeling more and more like I can't return that love because I feel like a horrible human being.

How do people do it? Just disregard something bad they've done, pick themselves up and move on? How do people like ex-offenders (who can change, nothing against them) just move on with their lives without dwelling on their past?

I feel the need to confess everything I've done to my family. But there's some stuff they wouldn't want to know. I'm sure they have skeletons in their closet as well. Why do I feel like my life is coming to an end? The only reason I don't go and off myself is because of the damage and leftover pain I would cause unto them.

"How to tell if it's time to do it?You know, when your life legitimately is falling apart and there's absolutely no reason for you to get out of bed in the morning? You're trying and fighting but it keeps backfiring. You give yourself some time, you reach a point where you feel somewhat stable... Then something bad happens once again to remind you that you're pretty much doomed to suffer. How would one be able to tell when it's time to just end the suffering altogether? I'm trying to get better but it isn't working. I want to die and those are my first words every time I wake up in the morning.",1

"Today I told my mom I am suicidal. Her reaction made it worse..I am 18 years old and have had depression and severe anxiety since I was 13 (diagnosed). I was also diagnosed with an eating disorder but have recovered since. My parents have always been terrible with dealing with my mental health, especially my mom who calls me a burden tells me she doesn't know how to deal with me, I'm making her crazy, or plain out ignores me. My dad, he tries and I really appreciate him for that and I know if he had a better understanding of mental health he could convince my mom that this is serious. My parents both do not believe in therapy. Ironic because I am studying to become a psychiatrist so you can already guess they don't support that. I have been telling my mom I need therapy for months because my mental state is rapidly deteriorating and she laughs as if therapy is some sort of shameful act. My doctor keeps referring me to a psychiatrist and my parents refuse to let me. The problem is, I lost my job, am living with my parents, covered by their insurance, so I cant move out or go on my own. I have regressed physically and mentally this last year, I gained weight, my acne is horrid, I have tried everything and give up I have not an ounce of confidence I feel like the ugliest person in the world. My mental health has gotten significantly worse, my cortisol levels are extremely high, I have been experiencing disassociation and derailment on top of my violent anxiety attacks. I also have been having nocturnal seizures my doctor says are from stress. 

&amp;#x200B;

Today while I am working o my 16 college assignments my mom starts criticizing me telling me I don't help her and gives me a list of things to do. I broke down and told her I can't handle this anymore and the last couple weeks I have been seriously considering suicide. Mind you, I have been dropping hints for weeks to her and she hears them yet ignores me. She told me to stop saying things like that in front of my siblings and that I bring this on myself. She's not a bad person and she goes through a lot but she makes it explicitly clear that my mental health is nothing but a burden to her. Anyway, I just needed to get this off my chest. I am trying not to give in to my urges and I am going to try really hard to get away from everything.",1
"I only live to create and I can’t even do that.The only thing keeping me alive is my art. I’ve been told all throughout my life that I’m talented and that my art will help those struggling like me. Maybe those people were just saying that to keep me alive well it worked. I love art. I love it so much that I’m afraid of failing so I rarely create. The only things that keeps me going is imagining my paintings fully fleshed out and in a museum or having my novel finally published, my screenplay actualized into film and my music being enjoyed by strangers. Yet I haven’t painted in a year, haven’t written in a year and never wrote a screenplay or a song. What’s keeping me alive are just fantasies. I need to stop procrastinating I literally have no other reason to live. If I continue at this rate I might as well  off myself right now.",1

Hate being a woman. Hate being bombarded with how not good enough I am, not sexy enough, thin enough. I'm 26 with some wrinkles and my life feels over. Hate how many male friends I fucking hate now because of how casually they refer to women as sex objects, fetishize impossibly beautiful kpop stars and anime loli girls.

Hate the constant fear of getting raped and the terror of getting pregnant because doctors wont let me choose for my body to be sterile. Hate that I go outside fully covered with a mask and still get harassed by men in public and nobody says shit. No matter what I do I'm an object that will be abused again, because people are animals following their own pleasure and don't care who they hurt. You're just a meat hole for them to have a fun time with and then get thrown away.

Hate that someone on reddit once told me ""men gotta nut"" its fucking terrified me every day since that men really can't control themselves and I'll keep getting raped because MEN GOTTA THEY JUST GOTTA NUT

Hate that the good men I know have to deal with me in this shattered state. It's not fair to them

"I will not commit suicide todayI think I have convinced myself that this is the only way. I'm always sad everyday. I hate the feeling when my heart begins to sink. I don't want to feel anymore suffering. 

People say that suicide is selfish. But they don't understand the pain inside. It's not selfish because the pain is unbearable. 

People say that when you commit suicide, you are weak. I disagree, it's not weakness or strength either. When you commit suicide you give up EVERYTHING. And most people are afraid to die. 

I just want to sleep forever and I don't want to think anymore. I don't think counseling will help because in order for it to be effective you need to help yourself to recover as well. And I just don't think I can convince myself to get better. 

I will not commit suicide today, but I think the time is coming.",1

"I'm at the park sitting in my car about to end my life soonNothing is changing. I have been fighting feelings of depression, and worthlessness ever since I was seven. Nothings changing. I've come up with dozens &amp; dozens of plans over the years to help me to get better. Nothings has changed. I'm still isolated, and depressed. I'm in my mid twenties but I've never connected with anyone because of my depression, and social anxiety. Never had a real companion or partner. My mom is supportive but I'm just disappointing her. I can't hold a job down because I'm either not assertive enough to have people not walk all over me or not functional enough (due to the depression) to do my job properly. I have a useless bachelors degree &amp; student loan debt.

I used to be scared of death but while walking in the store today I realized that life is far scarier. The sadness &amp; loneliness that I feel is eating me away. I'd rather it all go dark. I'm going to take a walk for a bit since that has always been my favorite past time, and then I'll end things in the car. Hopefully what I brought with me is sharp enough. I hope security will see me laying there when I'm finished so that my mom doesn't wonder where I am for too long. I'm sorry mom.",1

"I only seek peace.I am starting to doubt myself. I am so frequently humbled or humiliated by others now it is starting to wear me down.

It's just about every day that I will find myself in many situations that leave me feeling ashamed, disappointed, awkward, or inadequate. I hate these feelings, and they make me want to implode. It's simply a miserable existence to keep reliving those moments in similar experiences on a daily basis.

Part of it is my evolution. I have evolved to be more of a risk-taker. I somewhat recently begun using substances that could have consequences for myself in one way or another. I haven't had much restraint in this department, and when I get reminded of those ugly possibilities, it scares me.

In another life the risk-reward calculation would be much easier, but that's not how things are. The way things are would best be described as complicated. I have had the incredible privilege to have access to a potentially bright future. I am starting to journey a path that demands much success, and permits few mistakes. It is a path that is very intolerant of certain relevant infractions, and that is something I haven't fully personally acknowledged as of late.

In light of those revelations, I'm going to try to make some changes in my life to raise my self-esteem and restore a sense of pride, or maybe even instill a feeling of self-worth. It is hard to fathom it happening at all, so I'm going to really push myself to try and give myself the best chance possible.

It would be so much less painful to abandon life now than to face the challenges in my life or confront my demons, and that is one thought that is coming back to me. I will try to fight it, but I've nearly been beaten by it before. Regardless of what outcome may arise, I simply wish to find some peace in my life.

I hope putting this out there can help me get my life back on track, and I just want to thank anyone who has taken the time to read this or help others with their struggles. I wish you all peace in your lives.",1

"I'm thinking New Years..... I've decided to go out with a bang in Vegas on New Year's....
Killing myself has been in my head for the past month constantly.  I'm failing at life and I just don't want to figure it out anymore.  And this is coming from a happy go lucky person.  But my failure to succeed at this maze called ""life"" is driving me insane every day.

My present situation is this.  I live between two houses with my parents and work for our family business which I was going to take over.   This at my age already makes me feeling like the biggest loser in the world.  
I'm 41, just got my 4th DUI since 1996, and my life is going nowhere.  I'm stuck working for the family business, broke up with a girl I was in love with, pretty much in financial shambles, and I see no point of life right now.
  I moved back home  about 10 years ago and I've been stuck here ever since.  At the time I thought it was going to be temporary, but I got lazy and comfortable.   I see no joy right now.  I hate working, even though I'm about to start an Internet storefront with a partner to get away from the family.  Music, sports , movies, books, working out, doesn't give me the joy anymore.  Everything bores me and I'm basically lifeless.  Many of you might think this is because I'm an alcoholic, but this in all my honesty, is not the case.    I'm just really stupid and don't deserve to live anymore.  How can anyone get 4 fucken DUI's(all .08-.10) and not be an alcoholic???   Well this may sound like denial, but it's the honest truth.  It is my self destructive personality, and I just don't want to deal with it anymore.  
I had so much potential to live a fun, fulfilling life, and now that potential has turned into a nightmare.  
I just see so many character flaws within myself: vanity, not being honest in my relationships, laziness, not being self-aware, no humility, no discipline, materialistic, the list goes on,,,,   At this point in my life, the only thing that interests me is to travel and experience life.  But due to my self destructive behavior, this is looking impossible.  
Unless something drastic happens for the positive in the next few months, I am going to go to Vegas on New Year's and overdose on something painless.  In this way, it'll be easier on my parents and friends.   
And yes getting my 4th DUI triggered me to where I am at now but it's the other factors I just can't deal with anymore.

"I cant take it anymoreHello Im a suicidal 16-17 year old egyptian male and I had been diagnosed with ocd since I was 12 years old. my ocd at first was manifested with actions but soon it was gone when I was 14-15 years old. but soon it began to manifest in another way called ""pure ocd"" but back then I didn't realise it. I have a fear that Im a pedophile but I just don't realise it that I harm someone that Im incest etc.... but biggest thing im afraid of is that Im a pedophile and I just dont realise it. It got the point that I cant look at kids or even hild my little brother. the reason my mind keeps triggering it is because of these situations :

1 - when my father met his friend of work I was with him to meet his friends family including his daughter I was 15 at the time I thought she was pretty not knowing ger age and I didn't ask because I was taught it was ""rude"" to ask a female's name and I had a crush on her and I fetishised her when I jerk off but when asked her what is her age I thought she was gonna be 14 years... she was 12 and the worst thing about this that my grandparents told it's fine (egyptian culture is one of the worst considering pedophilia and some egyptian ppl are disgusting and it's ok for a 37 year old man to marry a 14 year old girl and said was an agenda and I almost believed it) and they thought that the crush is fine and I kept fetishising even after full knowingly that she is 12 and I'm 15 but I stopped having a crush on her cuz her mind was stupid eventho she looked like 14-15 and realized that pedophilia is manipulation

2 - when I was introduced to hentai I jerked off to all kinky stuff you name it (loli,slave,bdsm,rape,etc...)

Right now I'm visiting my home (my husband and I live in a different country).

 I came home for a while because I really missed everyone...and it brought back so much hurt for some reason. I love my sister and my mom...but I feel excluded by them. I have always felt this way really. She is spoiled...like imagine a kid asks for anything they want and she gets two. She doesn't care about spending time with her family or anything other than clothes and phones and dumb material things...I dunno. anyway. I get haunting thoughts of suicide every single day. Every day I say to my self, I know I'm going to kill myself, just when? What day will I muster the courage and just do it already? I hope it will be soon. I think about it and I just consider it a good thing. 

I barely sleep...maybe 2-3 hours a day so I am always tired. I feel like if I kill myself I'll finally get some much needed rest. I also think about taking all my belongings and just burning them before I die so it was almost like I never really existed. That brings a smile to my face. If I die I have no friends to miss me and a family who forgets me easily. The only person who might care is my husband. He thinks I'm a big bitch though. He has said it to me...mostly because I am detached from life and I try to keep him satisfied with all the love I can conjure but I don't think its enough for him. I am too empty so he finds me boring.

 I don't know what I can do. I don't have medical anymore, so I can't even go to a doctor without breaking the bank...anyway I'm rambling. I just want someone to care or listen to me...I just need a friend or something. If anyone wants to know more or share anything with me so I can just talk to anyone...that'd be cool. bye",1

He is going to the gym so i can talk back or anything or else he is gonna beat me up and everyone will support him because he is the ""popular"" guy. Shit like this hurts my feelings and I am a very sensitive person. I have all this rage inside of me when stuff like this happens but I can't talk back I don't have the confidence. I am the quiet kid you may say ( No I'm not a school shooter, I hate that meme) and if I talk back who will support me?. You may say talk to a teacher...NO. Maybe I am overexaggerating but as I said this not the first time it happened to me. Not  only from that person but some others to(but he is the main reason I'm tired of this shit). School never made me excited for this reason. It makes me fucking depressed. Any advise will help, please.",0

"I'm sorry for everythingI went and stole myself a devil's heart
'Cause mine was pulverized and crushed
And I drank all the whiskey in this town
Still I could not get enough

And I know that it's too late
But I'm sorry for everything

And now I'm stuck out here all by myself
It's hard to fill the empty hours
I'd like to force some gal to stay with me
But I just haven't got the power

And I know that it's too late
But I'm sorry for everything

You cannot live in constant solitude
Or your mind will surely burst
The rain will fall down on your withered soul
And then your bones will start to rust

And I know that it's too late
But I'm sorry for everything",1
How to tell someone you want to dieI’ve had suicidal thoughts pretty much everyday for the past 4 years and somehow I’m still here mostly because I can’t do it to my boyfriend. I love him so much but I don’t know how to tell him I’m an extremely suicidal person who breaks down at least once a week wishing I could take a miracle death pill. We’ve been dating for 2 years and he knows about my depression but I don’t think he knows how bad it is. I feel like I can’t tell him bc if I do die he will blame himself for knowing and I can’t be a burden to another person. Can anyone relate here? I don’t need convincing to stay alive bc I’m too afraid to end it rn. Just need advice on this.,1

I feel like a solution that won't crystalize no matter the scratching on the side or tine to cool down. I had a financial upswing aftery dad died, moved away from whatever minimal support system i might have had. I can rememver some reasons why but i dont care to recall any of them. Now, what options do i have. Be evicted, go to a different city. Place I'm from is as unattainably expensive as where im now. It doesn't matter. When i had nothing i was an unapologetic beggar. I don't care for going back to that way of life.  I won't work for anytbing else either. I don't want to fix any problems i.have. i dont. It'll just feel like going back to survival mode and then itll never stop. I just want my control back and end my own life. ",1

I'm tired of reading things about people who have attempted to kill themselves and are so glad it didn't work because guess what? When I woke up the next morning after swallowing all of my pills I screamed and cried because I was so angry to still be here. 
For as long as I can remember I've been going back and forth between feeling normal and slightly upbeat and depressed, but now I am so happy. Because I finally am doing something that's not selfish for once, something that's going to benefit everyone that I care about. I've analyzed all of my close personal relationships and every single one of them would have more positives than negatives if I just finally died, even my fucking pets. I'm waiting until after I go home for spring break so I can have a nice week at home with my family for them to hold onto and remember me by, and so I can have a little bit to straighten out all of my personal things and get everything in order. I'm finally at peace with myself and my life, but I want to thank you all for always being there for me in my lowest moments. Some lives are worth saving but I decided that mine wasn't, but you are all doing a great thing by being there for people who still have hope. Thank you all.",1

I dont think I can go on for too long...My desire to die is growing. I'm very sick. It won't stop unless I'm dead. I dont know whats to come in the future. I just can't do this anymore. I can't just keep going on. There really is no point. I cant do shit!,1
"The meaning of lifeI've been thinking about this a lot lately. When everything feels meaningless, like what's the point of moving forward. Why not just die and become a more meaningful part of the universe. As in matter, the building blocks of the whole existence. 

To me that sounds like the right thing to do. Right now if I had to tell you what's my purpose in life, that would be it. And I'd go do that duty of mine instantly, if I could do it without hurting anybody. But then again why do other people matter when you're no longer here?

So many bad things have happened in my life like people bullying me in school physically and verbally,sexual abuse,had to deal with toxic people,people coming into my life just to cut me out once I get attached to them it’s so fucking stupid it’s like a game that everyone is playing trying to push me closer to the edge I’ve been suicidal since I was 11 and people where like “it will get better” well fuck I’m still here two years later and it’s gotten way worse so what’s the fucking point I am 100% sure things are going to get worse I try to hold on for my family but I just don’t think I can I don’t know how to cope everything is just to much I hate myself I cut myself because it makes me feel happy for a bit but even that is not making me feel much better anymore I’ve been starving myself so maybe then people will treat me like a person but I guess at the end of the day I still hate myself and am still just as empty and not good enough as I was before so I just feel like suicide is the only escape from all this shit I feel like I’ve tried everything I can such as therapy and medication and talking to childline and suicide hotlines and talking to CAMHS I’ve been to the doctors it’s still just unbearable I have lost hope I’ve tried to end my life several times before and it makes me so upset that I’m still here like why the fuck can’t I just be at peace the only thing that’s stopping me from ending it all today is it’s my friends birthday so I can’t ruin her birthday that would be a shitty thing to do but I’m thinking tomorrow or the day after I will do it I’m trying to think of other options but I just can’t see any I feel like I have to do this",1
"Lost EverythingI'm 21, on a gap/work year to get a break from education, the past 4-6 weeks have been the worst of my life. Me and my girlfriend broke up, this was probably the most painful, we are still trying to be friends because there wasnt any drama, we just grew apart, but shes honestly always been the one constant in my life for the last couple of years and it's so hard. Shes still my best friend, but I can feel myself burdening her with all of my pain on top of hers. I'll always love her and want her to be happy.

I also lost my job a day or two later, and with that I lost all of the friends I had made whilst working there, the only couple of friends I have aside are so closed off emotionally that they dont really give me any opportunity to talk with.

This has all just put everything into perspective, my mother has battled depression for the best part of 25 years and I've seen her suffer and I dont want that for myself.

Just trying to reach out to anyone at all or a bit 9f reassurance/wise words would be deeply appreciated.

"How does the canadian psychiatric system work?My long-distance friend is 28 and I've been super worried about him. He's incredibly depressed and he has these emotional spikes where I'm worried that he'll do something rash. I can tell he's in a pretty severe spot. I'm on his speed dial list and I made him put a suicide hotline on his phone as well. I have his local police and hospital on my speed dial as well. 

He had psych treatment all throughout K-12 but since he got out of school he's been unable to get help, assuming that the public healthcare system didn't cover psych and that it'd be way too expensive. He doesn't have job and has been in and out of jobs probably because of this. He may have a few chemical imbalances (obviously I'm not a doctor, I'm just guessing)

He has a little girl he needs to stay alive for and his friendship to me means more than the world. I can't find consistent material: how can this guy get the help he needs? ",1

"I not suicidal per se, but I don't see the point in living. I'm ugly, stupid, and a failure. Even if things do get better, which is not a given, what's to say current pain doesn't outweigh future pleasure? Living is gambling in my situation.I'm 21 and I hate my life. 

Firstly, I'm hideous. I'm short, I have tons of moles, my face is asymmetrical, my teeth are crooked. I have no social skills and literally no one to even talk to. I had a girlfriend for about 7 months, but she broke up with me over my penis size. She could have just been using that as a scapegoat, but even if she wasn't, I can't really blame her. It's tiny and she deserves to be in a relationship where she's sexually satisfied.

I'm also a stupid failure. I'm supposed to start my second year of med school in a month, but I don't think I can make it. I finished around middle in my class last year (just below the half mark) which isn't too bad, but it's not enough to get into any decent hospital. Furthermore, I was averaging 120 hours a week every single week between class and studying. I would get about 5 to 6 hours a sleep per night and 4 hours for eating/traveling/laundry. I can't do that again, I just don't have the energy. Even physically, I can't do it again. The exhaustion and poor diet has caused me to lose a lot of weight. I went from a healthy 150 to about 115 or 120. Everyone else was putting in 60 to 80 hours per week. Some people would occasionally do 100, but then they'd take a day off to recharge. I literally have to work twice as hard for half the success of everyone else because I'm fucking stupid. The second year is supposed to be the hardest, so I'll almost certainly fail some classes if I don't put in 120 hours a week.

Right now, I don't see how dying would be dissimilar from euthanasia. It's possible for a terminally ill patient to get better, but the pain they'd have to go through for a small chance at getting better is too much of a gamble for them, so they choose to die.",1

"K-2SO x L3-37 fan fiction (chill I wrote this half jokingly and it's all in good fun, no need for pitchforks) This takes place a good while after The Rise of Skywalker, and follows the idea that K-2SO downloads his memory to the other Imperial security droid from HISHE.

K-2SO wakes up on a forest, surrounded by rusted and mossy debris of what looks like an Imperial ship. He stood and saw the tip of the old Rebel base, which has been largely devastated after an attack by The Empire. He wanders for a bit before finding what looks like a freighter.

""A Correlian YT-1300 light freighter, what is it doing here?"" He said to himself.

He stopped before walking any further as he sees that the base is no longer operational and came to two conclusions, The Empire won and wiped the Rebel Alliance or an escape was made right after a large battle. A large hairy figure spotted him as well as what seemed to be a droid model he's unfamiliar with. The figure was carrying a bowcaster and the droid was rolling around as his body was shaped like a ball.

""Do not shoot, I mean you no harm!"" K-2SO shouted, ""I am not part of the Empire despite what my appearance would tell you.""

The figure shrieks and K-2SO found out that it was a wookie.

""It may be impolite of me, but I do not understand Shyriiwook."" He exclaimed in a half joking manner.

One thing led to another and after a ripped arm caused by a Wookie tantrum, he was allowed to enter the freighter named The Millenium Falcon as well as the name of the Wookie (Chewbacca) with the rolling droid (BB-8) being his translator. He found out that they are there to wait for a Jedi named Rey who went and take a look at the base as a part of learning the Jedi's past. The other two were quick to accept him as the rebel database mentions a suicide mission including a reprogrammed Imperial droid that might or might not survived the battle at Scarif. Everything was going well until the Falcon was attacked by a jungle Rancor. They rushed inside and make quick work with the large beast, but with some significant damage to the ship, and BB-8 said to him that it would be nice if he would help to fix the ship.

""I no longer have a master, might as well made myself useful."" He replied.

After a scan it turns out that the navigation computer system was damaged a bit on the attack, and he chose to fix that first as it seemed to be the quickest one to repair. He soon realized that the navigation system is like nothing he ever seen with some of the most peculiar dialect. He's interested in what seemed to be self awareness as he never seen another droid expressed such way of thinking for a navigation system. He proceeds to connect the computer to his head using a cable to interact with it in a more face to face way.

""My name is K-2SO, I just fix the navigation computer and now I am interested in the self awareness of this system."" He exclaimed to the abyss.

""You, you're like me!"" A faint sound of a female is heard.

""I am sorry, I do not know what you're talking about and I know the difference between a droid and a navigation system."" He replied.

She continued.

""I am sorry to inform you but my self awareness comes from the result of my reprogramming and I'm sure that you achieved the same thing from a similar method,"" He answers ""it is not true awareness.""

""Oh it's awareness alright, the way you decided to fix me first without asking the only living thing on this ship, the way you decided to plug yourself in without other people telling you to, as well as your distinct personality."" L3 replied.

""That is not true, I was.... taking initiative by my own.... I see your point."" He said.

They chatted for a good while and even went into a heated argument about droid rights, but ended up passive aggressivelly agreeing with each other's views.

""Hey, thanks for fixing me, and talking to me, it's been a long time since I get to talk to another person."" She said.

""Do not mention it, I plug myself into this ship and I have no one to blame but myself for getting berated by another droid."" He replied.

""Shut up!"" She said in a sarcastic tone, ""promise me that you'll send my message to droids across the galaxy."" She continued.

""I do not see how they could have self awareness from your message as the chance of that happening is at most 0.62016%, but I will send them to other droids."" He assured her.

He unplugged himself from the computer.

""Well now I have job to do."" He said to himself.",0

"I have a 94% overall average in school but I’ll probably kill myself once I’m done school thoIdek why I’m choosing to do my work in school, I guess just to graduate from high school finally. But I don’t have any plans for the future, nothing interests me and it has been like that for 2.5 years since my diagnoses of clinical depression. I should be enjoying my life at 18, almost 19, but rather I focus on wanting to die almost everyday. I literally have the highest mark in one of my classes and I’m above average in marks in my other classes but little do the teachers and students know that I’m wanting to die every moment, and being numb to life.",1
"Update on my lifeHi! My name is Jon and I posted here 5 months ago saying I wanted to kill myself. 
I had planned it out very detailed. I talked about how I was anti-social and was about to fail High School. 
I was playing a lot video games, smoking weed and just a bunch of negative shit. 
But! I passed and got an B on my exams, applied for Uni and got in. I moved. 

First day of Uni, I realized I needed help. I'm done living in sadness and feeling shit for abseloutley nothing. 
First day of Uni, I'm dropping out and moving home. I'm going to focus on myself. I told my parents everyting. 
I told my closes friends how I felt and everyone is supportive. I have never felt more loved in my life, ever. 
I'm crying a little bit while typing this, because I was one of those people that thought the world would be a better place without me. It wont, but it wont get better ether. Unless you tell someone, talk to someone.

This marks my way to recovery, a healthier and happier life. I'm going to use this year to think and most importantly talk about my struggles. I will probably still cry sometimes, but you know what, thats fine. This is much better than living a miserable. First Day of Uni I'm proud to say I'm dropping out to pursue something I find much more important.
Happiness. 

If you are struggling and thinking nobody cares, realize you're most likely wrong. 
People care, they love you and would die for you. Asking for help is not weak.
I've come to realize its the strongest and most brave thing to do.

I still struggle. I'm not way better than I was, but I am on the way to get there. 
Thats what matters. 

Hope you guys have a great day. Seize it, realize its what matters to you thats important. 
Forget everyone else and focus on fixing you, my mans!
Cheers from a 19 year old from Europe. ",1

"How can I be honest so I can stay safe?I was wondering if anyone could give me any advice on how to tell a parent that their child is having suicidal thoughts and have had suicide attempts. I am working on being more honest with everyone about where I stand in my recovery and I feel like I need to be more open about this to stay safe, especially with my Mom. 

I just have concerns about telling her everything. I suppose she knows I have had thoughts about hurting myself since I was just in the hospital for it this past week. I am okay with her knowing that the thoughts were there, in the past and I refuse to talk about it. What I don't know how to tell her is that I tried to kill myself twice. I feel like it would crush her, but I don't know how else to express how serious this is and how much I need her to lock up my meds so the option is not just right there for me. I am not ready to be in control of my meds, I just don't trust myself.

Any advice on how I should approach this would be great. Thank you. ",1

"Need hope.Please try to read everything before commenting. 

1. I was in a car accident in february that ruined me financially, physically, and mentally. 
2. I worked as a lyft driver because im disabled so I spent 5 months unemployed because my car was totaled. I have a pending settlement on the way because im not at fault. 
3. I crowd sourced money for a car and went back to driving for lyft. 
4. 2 months later im in another accident and my insurance provider forgot to add rideshare endorsements to my policy. We're in the process of trying to retroactively add them. 
5. The more recent accident is 100% my fault. There's $5,500 in property damage and thats without talking abt the cars. 
6. My lawyer handling my settlement from the first accident says getting in another accident will likely tank my settlement because they'll blame my ""new injuries"" for crippling me for the rest of my life (EVEN THOUGH THE NEW ACCIDENT IS WAAAY LESS SEVERE) . So instead of walking out with 10k in my pocket im lucky walking out with 2k. 
7. I want to kill myself. The thought of being at fault for this accident and having NO coverage and having to pay everything is agonizing. I have no assessts (im probably going to have to surrender the car), I have no savings, I have no job, I have nothing. 

The only thing stopping me from killing myself if the fact that my debt MIGHT transfer to my mother which i cant force her to handle ontop of her disabilities, my demented grandma, and my shitty abusive older sister.

"Don't really feel like living anymore?This post might be a little messy because I'm in a pretty weird mental state right now, so I'm sorry in advance. I guess I just don't really want to live anymore even with all the ""silver linings"" of pushing through it or whatever. I'm not at physical risk right now but the thoughts are still very prominent. I'm transgender, my parents don't accept me, I'd be letting go of my family if I transitioned, and it's been recommended that I get tested for autism because I struggle a lot socially. I'm just really sad all the time but I don't feel like I even have a right to be. I'm about to graduate college and just the idea of entering ""the real world"" sounds too stressful and makes me have panic attacks. I guess people might miss me if I was gone but they'd move on from it because that's just what people do.

Sorry, I know I sound very unstable right now, but I guess I just don't know what to do anymore. I can't afford therapy and I've exhausted the free options in my area. It's all too hard and I just don't feel like going on anymore.",1

I thought this year after my father seeking help, getting a new job after not working, me going to college and the thought of us moving into a new house. All would be smooth sailing but no in the transition of moving into this new place and my mother having her vacation It has been nothing but yelling and being told me and my mom are fuck ups, no good and disappointments all because I slept in for work and my mother's vacation to see her family landed during the move period, which she deserved by the way after working two jobs for so long I still made it on time by him taking me and yelling that i cant drive despite all the practice ive done and they won't let me drive. and keeps bringing up the past even though its all over with. he says he just wants to leave us here and start a ""new chapter"" and doesnt want to know what I do after. I just dont know how to feel. So now I dont know where ill be in a week or if my belongings will be in storage or not and still trying to keep up with school and work is killing me this sense of not knowing creates the worst anxiety for me.  Even worse he says my mother won't have her car either when we have 2 ?? I don't know what to think anymore, I have just lost so much motivation to keep going, in school, my hobbies I couldn't even enjoy my mother coming home from her vacation. I just keep getting rides from friends trying not to show my emotions. I just want peace and stability , but what I get is just me on a bench at college crying trying not to be noticed. it seems when ever its in my grasp I somehow fuck it all up. why can't I be happy?

"My wife has terminal brain cancerIt's called Glioblastoma. She's 40, I'm 41.  She has a 5% chance of making it the next 5 years.  When the shit hits the fan I'm going to have to watch her die a slow and horrible death as she loses her mental faculties.  This beautiful woman that I have loved since I met 20 years ago is going to die a slow horrible death before my eyes.  We have two kids under 10.  It's been 6 months and she's doing as good as she could be, but I am so fucked up.  Almost every waking moment I think about how she's not going to be here as our kids get older.  How I'm going to be alone.  How I'm going to have to watch her descend into shit.  I can't do it.  I don't want to be here anymore.  I can't do this.  

I already know all the platitudes and the nice things that people are supposed to say to me, I've heard it all by now.  I went to therapy, I'm on antidepressants.  But everyone else gets to go home and not have to deal with this shit.  I don't.  And I can't.  I already threw away a year and a half of sobriety from my alcoholism.  I smoke weed every night to dull the pain of my reality.  I'm pretty sure if someone offered me a syringe full of hard drugs I'd probably say yes.

"I don't know how to get the help I needI'm not where I want to be, and I don't think I can get there anymore.  I'm being self-destructive, pushing away anyone I can, even somewhat going out of my way to cause new problems at work.  I keep drifting back and forth between feeling like it's pointless and like it's just torture.  Why does it hurt to exist if there's no point to existing?  

I can't explain how I feel to anyone.  When I try, they stop me, tell me to go see a therapist.  Therapists are not my favorite people, the last few all being somewhat an addition to my problems rather than a help.  One liked to answer her cell phone in the middle of sessions.  Another would shorten our sessions for various reasons.  The first therapist I ever met would draw circles over and over the entire time I talked.  The first few times she took notes.  I guess she gave up on helping at some point after then.

I've been hospitalized.  That didn't help.  The drugs they've been shoving down my throat for the last five years aren't helping.  I'm hurting.  I feel bad all the time.  I'm sleeping but it's not good sleep.  

The part of me that hates underachieving is what makes it seem like I'm not falling apart.  I'm excelling at work according to the recent work review.  But I've gone and created issues with my coworkers.  So that's bound to have a negative response soon.  The second I feel like I'm doing less than what I'm capable of is going to be the problem.  The second I feel like the one lifeline I can hold onto is gone, is the second I'll feel like I need to be fully gone.",1

"My functional depression is slowly turning into non-functioning depression and I don't know if I want to stick it out to the end result, whether good or bad.I don't know if this is the right subreddit as this will be my first original post ever on reddit, but might as well try. 

I have had high functioning depression for years, since 14 to be exact and I'm 22(F) now. I can actually remember the day when my depression began but I can barely remember the days from that day to now. It sucks.

Over the past year, my functioning depression has slowly turned to non-functioning depression (if that's what it's called). I struggle to do any self-care. I think I have some sort of eating disorder? Regardless, my relationship with food is horrific and it causes me to hate my body as I am very overweight. I am struggling to do my job, even quitting a high paying/harder job to an easier one, struggle to socialize, and to fake being okay. I went from being able to push through my dread to just curling up and almost whimpering until I just sleep through it. 

I have an incredible boyfriend who is supporting me so much. I see progress in some areas and loss in others. I have this plan to improve my life that I truly think will finally work due to my improved support system and such, but...is it bad I don't know if I want to fight through to the end result? I don't want to watch myself wither away, but I also feel too exhausted and weak to fight to a possible better place. It hurts more than normal due to losing friends due to my poor social skills. How I got my current boyfriend is honestly beyond me. 

I'm rambling now, but my point is: I don't really want to know the end result. I just don't. I would rather just cut the line now and know where it ends. I know what I should do, but I don't even know what I want. Does it get better? If I improve things, will I feel less tired? Less anxious? Will I even feel the slightest glimpse of a happy life? What if I don't? Just...so many what if's and I'm too tired to think of them all or, even worse, think of just...slowing decaying as a person, losing everyone, and all that mess. Nope. I refuse.

I'm definitely suicidal but...I don't think I will yet. I have a cat who I adore more than myself, and no one will take care of her to the right quality. I don't even take care of her the way she deserves, but my parents treat their animals like crap (not abuse, but still) and no one else can take her. And my boyfriend honestly adores me, and I don't want to let him down.

So, I'll fight for now I guess. I'm just putting myself in a forced routine with a personal trainer and work (no therapy sadly, too expensive ironically despite being able to get a personal trainer). Hopefully it'll help. The workouts do help I think. I don't know...

Sorry that I'm rambling. I just needed to get it all out there. This helps.

Thank you for reading.",1

And I said that 3+3=6 so we should set the timer for 6 minutes because it divides the heat... or something. But he disagreed and said that we should still set the timer for 3 minutes because (of a reason i forgot). So we agreed to set the timer for 6 minutes but take them out when 3 minutes are left. And when 3 minutes were left, I took them out and felt them and they were harder than usual. He felt them and agreed with me and said to put them in for the remaining 3 minutes... but still disagrees with me and thinks that he's right.

"Brother has expressed suicidal ideation to meMy brother (20) has been in a relationship with a non-binary person for several months and I'm concerned that he's learning behaviors and coping mechanisms that aren't healthy for him.  His partner is transgender, bipolar, non-binary, has trauma from going to doctors, and has gender dysphoria and severe social anxiety and depression.  Early September they were admitted to the ER for suicidal ideation, which my brother accompanied for support.  A week later they self-admitted themselves, which my brother was there for too.  Talking on the phone with my brother during that time, all he could say was how much he loved them and how he was afraid of all the pain he (and they) were in.  

Last week Wednesday he called my mom in the middle of the day, saying that he wanted to hurt himself and that he wanted to die.  She got him an appointment to see a doctor to get prescribed an anti-depressant (sertraline, same as me) that he was able to go to that day.  

I can honestly say that my brother has been going down this spiral of mental illness for as long as he's been in this relationship.  He's started smoking weed (which is whatever, I don't agree with it, but if it helps him great).  I feel like he's taking on the emotional stress that his friends are experiencing, simply because he cares about them so much.  Yesterday my mom went over to his dorm (planned) and brought our dog to visit him and drop off things.  Not once did he mention how he was doing, regarding the fact that just last week he wanted to kill himself.  He was never alone with my mom, he even made her stay out in the hallway so that she didn't see his friends inside.  He's learned to fake a smile for his friends to keep peace within their minds and their mental health.  The only time he ever reaches out to us now is if something is dangerously wrong.  Which is triggering for both me and my parents.  He's been seeing a therapist for a few months, but I feel like he's not taking it seriously.  If he's constantly lying and with-holding information to us, so who's to say that he would say anything to his therapist that he hardly knows?  

Thanks for reading if you've made it this far, I've never had to live with this sort of situation.  I feel like my family is splitting in two and it drives me insane to think that it might be because of the people my brother chooses to hang around.  He has always been such a kind, loving person.  I know he still is, but it's buried deep below lots of insecurity and sadness now.",1

They saying everyone has a place in this world yet they complain about overpopulation so how is this not a plus for me killing myself and getting rid of one less human with nothing to offer the world?

Time for the endBeen a long time since posting not a long time tho of the thoughts. Its been an on going battle in my head my heart my soul. The more I think I'm coming out of the hole the deeper I go in. Lately I've looked around I've said my good byes to certain people because I dont know if I cant keep pushing. I've cut myself before and never felt the pain which scares me even more. But lately on my rides home from.work I've looked at the tunnel I drive through and realize it's the best place hit the beginning of it speeding with no seat belt. The harder i try to clear my head the deeper I get. I'm so tired of the battle at home and at work I want to end it all. Im sorry for hurting those certain people.

"So I tried to hang myself todaySo I thought I’d share what happened. 
Ok so I stood on my bed with my head through I piece of rope I had somewhat tie wrapped around a beam not in a noose but kinda looped around a nail. Anyway that doesn’t really matter. So I was standing there I started to let all my weight hang in my neck my feet didn’t even leave my bed so I guess I wasn’t technically hanging but whatever. I felt all the blood rush to my head my felt light like when you hang upside down to long and you start to feel light headed but more intense. This was probably the most painful part. After that I don’t really know what happened it went really fast I guess I past out and I remember thinking about something Important or meaningful and I remember feeling a certain way but I can’t figure out what that feeling was or remember what that thought was I’ve tried so hard to remember but I can’t which really sucks. Whatever this thought was it somewhat woke me up my body suddenly felt a realisation of what was happening and stopped itself. I somewhat awakened and for a few seconds didn’t know what was going on I tried to move and was restrained by the rope around my neck I reached up and unhooked it and immediately collapsed onto my bed. I really felt like I was dying in this moment I tried to cough but I got stuck in my throat I couldn’t move I could barely breath a I automatically started crying struggling for breaths. I could feel the blood running through my hole body this sounds weird but I don’t know how else to explain it but I could feel every part of my body. It was the weirdest feeling and that’s the only way I can explain it like it felt like my body was coming back to life piece by piece. I really can’t explain the feeling. My neck ached and I was really hard to swallow my whole moth and throat get raw. It’s 5 or 6 hours now since and my throat and mouth still feel raw, my neck has a like a rash like mark around it aswell and a graze from the rope (which is gonna be fun to try and cover) I also have a lot of pain between the middle of my eyebrows and like the start of my right eyebrow. This pain feels as if I’ve just been punched in the face like when you get a black eye and the bruise is starting to develop. I originally thought that it was a bruise and I had hit my head but it doesn’t hurt when I touch it like a bruise would. It’s a really weird and painful.So yea that’s what happened I thought I’d share the story in case anyone was interested in what it felt like sorry it was so long.",1

"Right now I feel lostPeople always tell me that I am important to them. Words are just that. They can incline feelings and emotions, but they can't make me see, or feel any specific way. I've been having feelings of depression for about three years. I am 16 years old, a sophomore in high school. The problem is I don't feel like I have anything to be sad about, but that is the only emotion I can feel. Everything else is an emotional numbness that doesn't allow me to feel anything other than lost. I have friends and I have the support of them. They were by my side before and after I came out of the closet. My parents love me, and my brothers are there every step of the way, offering support as I struggle my way through life. I feel like the problem is myself, and the lies my mind is telling me. I'm the only person that I can trust, but unfortunately what I tell myself to do is not good. I started self harming about a year ago to deal with the emotional distress. It felt like the only way to express something I couldn't put words to. The only thing that makes me feel like I have a purpose is that I have the power to end my life. It's like the only thing that I have that gives me a purpose. I am completely in charge of what happens to me. I want a future, but the voices inside my head aren't in agreement. I guess I just don't know why I feel this way, or why people would even care about me.",1

But it is difficult in South Korea to get immediate help- I have to wait until Wednesday. I feel like I am going to kill myself if I don't find a distraction. But if I write and fantasize romance, will it disappoint me? It's about an overworked, depressed person finding a soul mate who can help him out. But from what I've learned, romanticism can bring greater hurts. In reality, people are different in real life than some stupid romance stories. People can't for each other's needs, and they can bring greater disappointments in real life. But what the hey- how much a disappointment cost? I think being turned hurts a lot less than suicide, right? ",1

"I'm (19 F) feeling truly suicidal and I feel I have run out of options. Any advice?I've been depressed for as long as I can remember, but only recently it's gotten severe and I'm genuinely considering suicide. 

Background on me:

- I'm 19, female, and black.
- I'm in my 2nd year of college - I plan on graduating a year early. 
- My father sexually abused me for 7 years (5-12; took my virginity at 11)
- I've always had friends - never close friends. 
- Never close with any family members. 
- I'm introverted, but not shy. I know how to talk to people, I just don't. 
- I've dated quite a few *men* from age 18 to now (all white; this seems to be my preference) 
- I fell in love at 16 and that destroyed me in multiple ways (we dated for 2 years, then one day he didn't reply to my text messages - haven't heard from him in over a year - first person I opened up to)
- Major eating issue (I've lost and gained up to 40 pounds *multiple times* over the past 5 years; I eat too much or too little + exercise too much or not at all) (I'm one extreme or the other, I'm a master at losing and gaining weight)
- Seen 3 separate therapists (first 2 for depression, 3rd for eating problem - no help)
- I've called suicide prevention twice, nothing useful for me there.
- Made one suicide attempt at 15.

Recent stuff that has me down: 

- Not doing so well in school this semester.
- I feel behind and have anxiety about grad school, interships, jobs, future (paying off loans etc...) 
- My body issue is getting worse (I've barely eaten the past 3 days except this special laxative tea)
- I feel hated - more than usual. I feel uglier and fatter than usual. Sadder than usual. Invisible more than usual. 
- Not feeling connected to anyone (campus is full of immature guys, and SJWs)
- Starting to realize I have *no one* in my corner (no friends, family, professors, animals, guys) (been at college nearly 2 years and have made no solid friends; only thing that keeps me sane/feeling normal are the men I date)

I wouldn't call myself optimistic, but I always figured there was more for me in the future so I kept going. 

I've never wanted to give up this badly before, I'm finding it very difficult to see past this...

...but when I do, I can't help but think, ""well you're going to die one day, why even stress yourself like this?""

I know he’s trying to help but it’s like say someone tore your arm off but you’ve had surgery and you’re all better now. But you’re always angry and upset about your arm and you constantly cry to the person about your arm. I’m sure they feel bad and will try and to help but at the end of the day they’re the one that did it to you.",1

I’m now unemployed, have $60 to my name, less than 1/4 tank of gas in my car, lost all of my friends, had unsafe sex (a lot), and then got raped and strangled until I almost died. Now, I want to die.I’ve fallen into a deep depression. A soul crushing depression. I knew those fucking serotonin receptors would give out sometime, but I didn’t think it would go from call the cops on myself bad to complete despair. The sadness was so hollow and thorough and complete. I’m on day 2 of no sleep fueled by chainsmoking cigarettes and weed with a Xanax tossed in for the agoraphobia I’m now dealing with along with the depression, so that’s nice. I wound myself up all day to try to go get food. I took the Xanax. I waited. I was ready. I even drove there. For my card to get declined. So now I’m down to my bills which is $60 total. I accepted my death when he was choking it out of me and something fundamental broke inside of me.  Now I’m only afraid of if my suicide attempts *don’t* work. About the pain, further possible disabilities, regrets, what I’ll put my family through and have to be around for, if I’ll become too anxious and call 911. I have so many scenarios in my head.

"Word VomitI'm 24, never been kissed, and have spent most of my life hating everything I've done.

You can check my history for what's happened in the past decade if you really care that much.

I don't have a job, don't have love, I'm sick of being alive, and I just want it all to stop. I really don't care if I'm attractive, I don't care if I'm intelligent, I don't care if I'm kind, I don't care about any of it. It all may be true, but it doesn't make up for the fact that I'm a shitty unstable mess of a person who can't find people to be with in this dead end hellhole of a pothead infested, drug addicted, sketchy ass town. I've wasted so much of my life here and I've missed out on so many experiences I'll never get back.

And do you know why I want to go on this senseless rant and kill myself? The fucking birds outside my window woke me up at 5 in the morning and I'm so unstable and angry at this point in my life that the lack of sleep is enough to set me off and make an ass of myself on Reddit. It would honestly be funny if it wasn't so sad. Well, I dunno, it's a little funny.

This has happened before and I tried to slit my throat with an exacto knife, but the ""pop"" of the tip of the knife as it cut through the very first layer of skin stopped me. Couldn't even draw blood.

This life is a fucking joke. I'm gonna die alone in a town I hate without ever experiencing love. Sure, you can be happy without, but why cripple your happiness like that?

I'm doing my best, I'm gonna spend all the money I have trying to move somplace where there is actual work and people who are doing things with their lives. I'm just so tired. I just want to give up hope. I just hate my life so much. I hate myself indescribeably. Such a pathetic waste of human life. 

Okay I'm done with my emotional purge. I'm going to try going back to sleep. I'll still be here tomorrow, but I can only hope that maybe one of these days I'll get around to injecting KCl into my veins.

"I should probably pace myself since this is like the 3rd time I've uploaded in 24 hours, but heres an acoustic cover of Pompeji by Deftones that I just did. https://youtu.be/dGoYoWWuqR4



I'm actually really happy with how this sounds on an acoustic, especially cause the song originally uses an 8 string guitar. Plus I learned it mostly by ear so I'm kinda proud of that. Enjoy!",0
"I don't know who I am anymoreThat's where I'm at right now as I write this. I've been depressed for years now, but the depression this time is different, stronger. I don't really feel down, I just feel empty, drained of everything that was ever considered me. I rarely 'feel' anything anymore, or at least I no longer know how or what to feel. Things I used to enjoy I can no longer stand or no longer get any pleasure out of. I have no motivation to do anything other than sleep and I only do things because I'm obligated to. My personality is gone as well and the feelings I've had for those close to me are no longer there. When I call my dad or mom I feel nothing. I don't feel like myself anymore and I have no idea who I am anymore. I just feel like a ghost crudely occupying and controlling a fleshy shell. I mean, there are times when my legs or my hands don't feel like mine. My cognitive ability is completely shot as well and I can barely remember things more than a day's past. Just typing this is an ordeal, constant spelling mistakes and typos.

On top of all this, I have no one to talk to. I have no friends to talk to. Sure, my Facebook profile says otherwise, but I never talk to any of them online, let alone IRL. I can't even tell my family because I know all they'll do is worry and try to fruitlessly help. I mean, I sometimes go so long without talking to someone that I will forget how to speak properly, even with people I know quite well. I wish I had someone I could talk to on a regular basis, but I've realized this will never happen because I always end driving people away for one reason another, be it my personality and mannerisms, or just because they found something better. Some say a therapist or counselor might help, but they never have for me. 

The problem is myself. I'm physically repulsive. I've seen the way people look at me and the way they behave around me. I mean, who wants to be seen talking to a fat, greasy, pizza faced, creeper-stache monster with a sweat problem? Even if they can get past that outer shell, what they find isn't any better. I'm a dull person. The things that interest me typically don't interest others and vice versa. My personality and interests just aren't compatible with most people. And even with people that share the same interests I usually end up screwing things up by doing something stupid, or something about me drives them away.

And for those that are close to me I feel like an inconvenience. Maybe not so much a burden, but just one of those people where others go, ""Oh, here comes THAT guy again. Quick, let's think of a reason not to hang out with him."" FFS, I even feel this way with complete strangers. When I'm crossing the road, buying groceries, riding the bus, or just simply standing around. I just get this sense that people wish I weren't there. That if I weren't, their day would be 100% better.

I'm also an addict, or rather becoming one. For years I was addicted to sleeping pills and benzos, anything that would knock me out and numb the mental pain. Then I was diagnosed with HPPD and I stopped for awhile. Then I became addicted to benzos again and I started drinking. I managed to kick those for a few months, but now I'm back at it. Every night I find myself drinking or experimenting with some new benzo. 

Anyways I feel like I'm rambling a bit. I guess if anything could stop me from doing what I'm planning on doing, it would be if I could have myself back and someone close to talk to. I want the old me back, the me that had friends and enjoyed things like playing guitar or staying up until 5am to figure out a bug in some code. And I wish I had someone I could talk to about how I feel. Because I don't have someone to talk to, I just keep things in and never let them out and I think I finally broke whatever was inside of me by doing so. Some might say get a therapist, but I've tried in the past and it just doesn't feel genuine enough. I need a friend, not a therapist. Some might also say to call up some old buddies from high school, but again, I feel like I'm such an inconvenience to them. 

Anyways, come Wednesday night (I have some things I need to take care of on Monday and Tuesday, some final preparations) I'll finally be done with this. It's not that I'm in any sort of emotional or psychological pain, it's just that I'm tired of not feeling, tired of feeling like an empty shell. Unless a miracle happens between now and then, there's no stopping me now. I've gathered my materials and made my preparations. I'm just putting this here because I felt like I should at least get these things off my chest.

"I’ve been forced out of my life after I was just beginning to recoverThis past summer I had a psychotic break that set me back completely after 8 years of working through depression, anxiety, and trauma. Last semester I spent the whole time isolating myself, actively suicidal, unable to get myself to do anything unless it was my school work or an obligation. 

This semester I moved residences to be in my fraternity house with a lot of other people and finally felt like I could make progress. I started to develop more connections with people and knew I had people I could turn to at any time of the day if I felt like I was unsafe with myself. I started to make improvements. I had a whole plan of what I wanted and needed to do to reach a comfortable level with myself before I graduate this spring. 

But now everything’s shattered. Our school was shut down somewhat suddenly amidst the virus outbreak and I panicked and left with a couple of friends who live somewhat near my area, terrified it would be my only chance to leave. Only once we were on the road did I realize this was the worst decision I could’ve made. I don’t have a lot of supports in California. All my friends live far away from me and I can’t see them since I don’t have transportation. 

I have a decent relationship with my family but due to the fact that I tried to kill myself in their house, I can’t go back there because I get violently depressed. My parents don’t even know I’m in the state. I’m stuck with nowhere to live except to house hop, which I don’t want to do, and my depression has come back horrifically. I don’t see myself recovering from it this time, as I have no way to reach the supports I finally made. 

Right now my only option is to go back to my house in California for a couple of days, but I can’t stay long. I don’t know what to do. The depression has gotten so bad that I don’t want to live or do anything related to living, like eating or moving. I want to find a way back up to Washington but it might be impossible. I’m really, really scared. I felt like things were finally going to be okay. Now I’ll never have the chance for them to be okay, since this was my last semester at school...",1

"Should I make Manwich or shoot myself in the head?In the last month I lost my job and my wife left me. I quit smoking weed about nine days ago both to simplify the job search and to give myself some clarity to process everything. Fucked up thing is, even sober I seem to find myself thinking about doing it more and more often. Tuesday night I broke my hotline cherry, twelve minutes on the phone bought me another chance at life. Tonight I had a brief staring contest with my Glock 19, but it's back in the nightstand for now. I hate living without a partner. It took so long to find her and I can't imagine rebuilding what we had together over those six years. I feel totally lost on the job front as well because I just spent three years getting a graduate degree to do a job it turns out I hate too. Every morning that I DIDN'T kill myself, I'm glad I didn't, but it's hard to hold onto that when I just don't want to feel this shit anymore. I used to numb a lot of things with the weed, and facing this all head-on, dead-ass sober is brutal. Not really sure why I'm writing this, but there's nobody in my family I could say this too without ending up in a hospital and that's the last fucking thing I want right now.",1

"It's getting harder and harder to hold onIn the past, I've dealt with depression that felt like something was just weighing me down ... it was like it was just difficult to be motivated to do things or hard to enjoy and experience certain moments. Suicide used to be out of the question either because of religion or because I knew how much it'd hurt people I know. Recently, though, I just feel genuinely sad for no reason. Every day feels like it's getting worse. My whole body aches, my parents are getting frustrated because I'm not handling things well, and anyone I know from school doesn't care enough to help. I feel like I've given up on finding love or anything and have submitted to being alone for most of my life. I used to worry about how all my friends or peers would cope with my death, and now that doesn't even feel like a concern to me. I would feel bad for hurting my parents but realistically anyone else who would notice I'm gone would forget about it in a month or two. I've tried reaching out to friends, I don't feel comfortable reaching out to family, and I don't know where else to go.",1

"My mom was the only reason I kept going.
I dont know what I want to do, not that there's much to do. Since about a year before I dropped out of High School (yesterday) I have felt what I could only describe as worthless, apathetic someone called me but I don't know if that really fits because I've always cared about my family. I wouldn't mind being a garbage-man, but for several years I've gone to school to make my parents happy. See I grew up kind of wealthy (Dad is high up in a pretty big company in my area) but I was always mistreated by my dad. My parents never married so when they split up and I stayed with my mother she didn't get a lot. That was when I was 9, since then I've lost pretty much all contact with my dad but I kept going in school to make my mom happy and allow her to retire earlier, I'm not very high maintenance so I'd put some of my money away for her, that was my plan anyway.


I have 3 older brothers, well, they're half-brothers. I won't disclose their names but the reason I mention them is because I've always wanted to be better than them. I know that's selfish but when you see something happen, a mistake you think to yourself ""I would have done that so much better"" until it happens to you, and you do the exact same thing. What I meant by the earlier statement is that several years ago my youngest older-brother tried to kill himself, I stopped him though. 


Me claiming that I stopped him feels kinda bad as well because I think I'm a big reason of why he wanted to die. Until his teens he was great, we were really good friends, I say friends but I mean he'd play with me and my toys. When he was in his teens and I was 3-4 years younger he felt really bad. I'm pretty sure he was depressed, I didn't understand it though, I just saw him skipping school and getting angry at people, angry at me. As he got angry at me I got angry at him, I started calling him things (Made fun of his pimples and such), claiming that he did things that he didn't, because I felt like I was being attacked for no reason. (By the way, the things I claimed he did weren't anything big, they were like ""He took the snickers from you, I saw it!"" when I had hidden it so they couldn't find it.)


It was a neverending circle of sadness and anger, he'd get angry at me so I got angry at him and it never ended well, I tore down things from his walls, he'd hit me, I'd hit him back.

Anyway, I thought he was just being a fuckhead, I don't anymore, I've apologized about it but I think I feel the same way he did. Useless, worthless, whatever you want to call it.

Now my mother, my mother can get unreasonably angry really often, for a lot of times. But I've always felt like she cared, not just for my studies but for me. But recently, well yesterday she threw me out after I told her I dropped out, called me everything that I already think of myself and more and has removed me from everything, isn't responding to calls or texts. My stuff is still there to get though but I don't know if I want to stay around for that long because right now I really can't think of anything that makes me want to live.

"URGENT!!! Friend threatening to commit suicideHi

A close friend of mine has verbally communicated and generally stated that he will kill himself on ""January 21st at 6pm"". He lives in a abusive household and his grades are not very good. He is unpopular under girls, my friends and I believe that he is genuine about his threats and we really want to stop this. I have thought of putting a keychain tracker on his keychain while he is not watching and then follow him around after school on the 21st but i believe measures should be taken beforehand. My friends and i have decided that we want to send his parents an email from an anonymous gmail account but i personally done know if this will benefit him at home. I cant think of anything past that and i don't want to get his parents in legal trouble even though i have audio-evidence of their abuse. My suicidal friend has exclaimed he wouldn't do it because he would ruin the lives of his brother and make his own even worse. I do not know what to do next, please help me this is URGENT!!!

"I don't know what to do anymore	I don't even know how to really begin this post other than I am fucking miserable with my life. I'm a senior in aerospace engineering at a really good school for my program, and thus far I've done pretty well in school with about a 3.5GPA. But I just feel absolutely lost and hopeless everyday.

	I haven't been able to get any intern or research experience in my field yet and its absolutely crushing me. I had a couple decent opportunities fucking crumble last summer thanks in part to COVID, so I had to resign myself to working a shitty retail job to make some money. To add to the fact, my fairly young family cat quickly and unexpectedly developed some health problems requiring we put him down right before I came back to school.

	I have struggled a lot with feeling badly the past couple of years, but this year and semester has taken the cake. I told myself I would go straight to grad school so I could avoid trying to find a job without any intern or research experience, but now I'm realizing I may not be able to even fall back on that as my school's program is seemingly quite competitive and I somehow need to find 3 professors to write me letters of recommendation. This is difficult, as my program has been so large its been so hard to ever be more than just another face in the class. Of course a lot of it is my own failure as well, which just helps to perpetuate my current state of intense self-loathing.

Truthfully I hate everything about myself. I am intelligent but waste it due to a seeming lack of enthusiasm or ambition. I find myself to be physically unattractive as well, in addition to a shitty personality that is not capable of sustaining a relationship. I have been in a couple brief relationships in the past, but in the first one I was cheated on, and the second relationship was fairly short and it ended due to my inability to meet the needs of the relationship. Naturally, I was the one who was dumped in both cases.

	Everyday I wake up and feel the crushing weight of self hate and anxiety. I feel like a complete and utter failure in every meaningful aspect of my life. Oftentimes I wonder what it would be like to jump in front of a bus or jump off one of the tall parking garages on my campus. I know I'm too much of a pussy to actually kill myself, but I often wonder or wish for the relief it would bring. Too not need to worry about the stress and anxiety anymore. Too not need to feel a burning self-hatred every second of the day. I don't think I'll be acting on this anytime soon, as I could never do that to my parents, so I suppose I'm resigned to several more decades of being a living waste of space. 

	I just really don't know what to do, or even why I am writing this. I guess I just wanted to type my thoughts out. Maybe I'm still foolishly hoping there is some light at the end of the tunnel, that I'm not unequivocally fucked for the rest of my life. If you made it this far, thank you for reading this garbage. I don't expect any advice or words of comfort/encouragement, I just wanted to put my thoughts into writing I guess.",1

"I used to be one of you.I wish I came across this subreddit earlier. It's so sad for me to read some of the things in here. I used to be where every one of you currently is. Dragging along in life, knowing that things can never get better. I've attempted suicide a few times in my life. The first time was by hanging when I was 15. The last few times were through intravenous overdose of heroin.

Things have happened recently in my life. In 8.5 short months, I have been able to change my thinking and behaviors, and completely turn my life around. I'm 23 years old. I should be dead, but I pulled myself out of the hole I lived in for 22 years. I promise you that there is a light, there is a better way to live. There is happiness waiting for you if you pursue it and just hold on long enough for the miracles to happen.

Life likes to test the strong, never the weak. Don't sit in your own despair, looking at your miserable past, keep moving forward no matter how hard that might seem. You are the strong. You can and will overcome, but it does take effort and patience. On your darkest of days, I know you feel that no one fully loves you. That you're tainted, unlovable, ugly. But know that I love you, and if it were possible for me, I'd fly to every person in this subreddit and extend my hand, in person, to help you see this light of mine. Unfortunately, I can only extend the invitation of you sending me a message. Please do.

"Basically, I'm exhausted.I've cried for ×× years straight and I finally numbed out half a year ago.

I still want to die, but since I know I don't have a good way to do so, I just want to throw all of my grandiose ambitions out of the window and just finally come to accept that I won't reach any of that, ever, and that does not matter anyway.

Since my existence is insignificant in any way, even it I want to change the history of mankind and even if I would, hear death will still happen and human will forever be forgotten, me included.

Both my mental and physical health are horrible.
And I will way more likely not get better, even if I eventually get help it will be too late.

I can't get help for either, because I'm still dependent on others to care about it and take me to the places needed and get me all the shit like that.

"I can't do this anymore (23F)I was physically, emotionally, sexually, and verbally abused for almost 6 years. I got out in November of 2014. But since then, I've been having panic attacks, anxiety attacks, and I have PTSD. I'm scared of the dark, loud noises, and being alone. 

I have no money. I work all the overtime I can get and I still have no money. I have to pay for a mortgage and all my bills alone. 

I have a boyfriend who supports me. But lately, my mental issues have been tearing us apart. Tonight, I got scared at a party and went to the bathroom to cry. And he left, walked to a friends house and said he would talk to me tomorrow when he cooled off. (There's more to the story, and we live together. But I don't feel like explaining it).

"I don't know what to do.Almost exactly one year ago I was on the verge of suicide. I realized, while writing my suicide note, that I was not actually doing anything to help myself. In what was an agonizing decision at the time, I decided that I'd set some goals and, if I achieved all of them before the end of 2019, I would not blame myself for suicide. I finished the final goal last week. 

I want to say that the goals were not easy. Some goals were well defined, some were not. I went to therapy, quit drinking, joined a gym, lost 20 lbs., read a dozen self-help books. I joined several clubs, found new hobbies, and tried a lot of new things. I advanced my career and made plans to buy a house (real plans, I got a financial advisor). I went on dates for the first time in years. My life is objectively better than it was a year ago, why am I so unhappy?

There's still a few weeks left in the year but really, what else can I do? I am actually looking for suggestions (I'm willing to push the deadline if anything seems promising) one of my less concrete goals was I have to feel like I'm trying.

It's not the isolation that's driving me crazy it's the lack of motivation to do anything at all. Normally I wouldn't talk to people if I didn't have to, I wouldn't leave the house unless it's 100% necessary but it's the feeling of being trapped, like I'm in a prison cell and I can't leave. There's something about it being technically illegal to go out that makes me feel the worst.

"Okay SW, let's see how you handle this one.It took me a while to get this done because I absolutely hate talking about this but something needs to be done.  Haters gonna hate so downvoters do your thing.

Yes I am thinking about killing myself.  Again.  Let's just get that out of the way.

Now, for a back story, which involves (predictably) a girl and a few regrets.

In 2003 I nearly slashed my throat with a knife.  I was a self-injurer back then.  I nearly bled to death, once.  I got it cleaned up though and nobody noticed.  That was the closest I've come to killing myself until a few years later.  This is probably what really set in motion an ongoing cycle of suicidal thoughts -&gt; almost suicide -&gt; hey things got better -&gt; things are okay -&gt; oh god what the FUCK -&gt; suicidal thoughts -&gt; again.

Over the years I've gone in and out of this cycle several times.  I am currently bouncing between ""oh god wtf"" and suicidal thoughts.

I'm going to summarize the most recent disaster quickly because I fucking hate having telling this story for the 11 millionth time.

In 2005 I met a girl - I will call her Susan - we were classmates.  It took me 2 years to work up the courage to ask her out.  She said no, of course, but I was proud of myself for trying.

We graduated in 2007 and maintained loose contact (her idea, really).

In 2008 we started talking about things over email.  We shared a few personal things.  Susan was a friend of my own friends so we were already part of the same social circles.  We got close (as much as you might be able to over email).  I guess I must've been doing something right because she invited me along on a trip to another country with several of our friends.  Did you get all that?  Susan, myself, and a few other people were all going on a trip to another continent.  This was her idea.

So in 2009 we go.  At first Susan is herself but about two days in a switch flipped inside her head and suddenly she turned distant, bitter, short, angry, annoyed, etc etc.  I didn't understand what was going on and it was putting a serious damper on my ""vacation"".  This went on for two weeks.  She had become a completely different person.  My solution for calming down involves removing myself from a bad situation, but in this case, being trapped on the same bus/car/plane/room/hotel/trolley/whateverthefuck meant I couldn't get away from the problem so I eventually had a panic attack for the first time in years.

We get back, she says she never wants to talk again, we bitch back and forth a few times through email a few times, done.

Well fuck.  Vacation ruined.

Oh, I should clarify, we weren't dating.  Heh, we were ""just friends"".  We never touched each other.

&lt;/story&gt;

The story above occured in 2009 (it is one of several similar stories).  It's been a year to the day, and I'm am still goddamn mad as hell.  I can't even put into words how fucking pissed I am about this.  I cannot fucking believe that someone would treat me so terribly and then later just walk the fuck away like I wasn't worth the trouble.  Furthermore, Susan has manipulated her schedule such that it's either Susan + friends or me + friends for hangouts.  Not that I would show up if she was there anyway.

This incident has unleashed a torrent of pent-up anger and regret and hate and bitterness that has been stewing inside me for years.

When I was a kid, I had a habit of getting the shit beat out of me.  Either at school or at home, someone usually had their first or hand against some part of me in anger.  People told me that they hated me, that I was a burden, that I was stupid, that I should kill myself, that nobody else on this planet would ever love me, or that I was ugly, or weak, or etc etc so on so forth.  I would get things stolen from me, I'd be singled out for ridicule, or wrongly blamed for some crime, or some other shitty thing would happen.  I dealt with it, though, because even when things were absolutely fucking miserable, I would think to myself ""man, when I'm an adult, things won't be so bad, I'll have money and a girl and things will be okay"".

I guess that feeling died in 2003 but I kept finding ""litle reasons"" to hold on.  Now in 2010, I am 25 years old, I go to the gym three times a week, I make almost 80k/year, I have no debt, and I am in good physical health, so shouldn't my life be working out okay?  I am so bitter and angry about how people have treated me that I just want to just get a shotgun and blow my brains all over the inside of my living room.  I cannot stop living in my past.  I still have nightmares about high school, nightmares about Susan, nightmares about women in general and generally feel like shit, all day everyday.  I am 25 years old and while I see people around me having fun and being happy and moving on with their lives I still stand there and think, wait a minute, what about me?  When does all the fun start for me?  Girls?  Hello?

When I go out and ""try"" to do something good for myself, I can tell in the way that people look at me, or the way I'm treated, that people just flat out do not like me.  I know this is because of my defensive nature.  I was taught to act that way by those useless asswipes from my early years.  I cannot break that feeling of ""oh god, this guy/girl is about to totally flip the fuck out and I'm going to be in so much trouble"" when I meet new people.

I'm seeing Susan again at a friend's wedding in about 36 hours.  She emailed me once to say she's ""sorry about what happened last year"" and ""hope you don't have any reservations about seeing [her] at the wedding"".  I am so anxious and pissed and upset I could barf until I turned inside out.  Twice.

UGH.  Wall of text.  Fuck everything.",1
7/5/2020.I’m a hassle to those I really love and care for. I shouldn’t even say that though. I’m just desperate for someone to say they need me around. No one does though. I assault myself with words daily. I’m filled with hate. Actual hatred. I think I’m going to end up killing myself. That’s just how it is. I can’t get help now. I’m too far gone. It’s only a matter of time really. I’m too emotional. I wish I was like other guys that were more manly. I hate having emotions. I feel weak. I cry too easily. I get too emotional. Sometimes I think I have some sort of disease. The things I dream of can never become a reality. I’ve only wanted one simple thing for a long time now. I’ll never be able to get it.,1
"Well hello thereI'm 14 and it might seem like I'm just trying to be edgy, but please listen. So basically I always had some bad days and that's alright I get that, but these past two years have been really rough for me since I suddenly started really hating myself and then I realized no one actually likes me. Not my family or school because I don't have any friends. I'm shy so talking to girls is a nono and I'm fat, ugly, untalented and just boring. I just feel like I'm just a background character but somehow I was cut from the story. And especially this past week or so, I've been just crying at night quietly so no one can hear me because if I was heard I'd be told to stop or be yelled at. They might ask me but what would I say? It be awkward. Also I found that I really want to die and when I feel extremely stressed I just hit myself in the head or choke myself really violently in hopes that I would just die. Idk I just feel like everytime I try, I just get hurt and fall down. I get up and retry I get hurt and fall down. If I just kept laying down I keep on suffering. How much can I take of this? Am I just doomed to live like this while other have it much better? If I died would anyone REALLY care? No one cares now so why would they? Does it get any better? I make jokes but so unfunny. Is it just a phase? Am I supposed to just walk it off and ignore it? I'm just confused.

"A way outHi,

Not sure if I am at the right place. I was just feeling so lost and somehow just ended up here. I am currently pursuing an undergraduate degree in STEM with a particular accent on cancer. Spent the last year of my life on my research, non-stop, nearly every day whilst trying to keep on top of my lectures. In the end, it has yielded a lot of new findings and should hopefully help with the understanding of cell cycle progression. However, I just feel dead inside. I lost most of my friends , not like I had many from the beginning. A few dropped out. Did not really have anyone to talk to. The research proved to be so complicated for me personally, I am not really smart, that I contemplated suicide a few times as a way out. Never went through with it. Parents would be so disappointed. Always tried to show them that I am not the most stupid in the family. Now that I have obtained all the results, my dad just dismissed their significance and questioned whether I am actually studying. This just completely destroyed me. I am so lost and just want a way out. Feels like now is the good time to go and just kill myself. Supervisor will be able to make better use of results anyways for his future research.

"I’m legitimately useless and my family is suffering because of me.To elaborate, i quit my last job in April of this year and have not been able to get a job since then. Because I quit my job, my mother has had to work twice as hard to bring in money. My brother has also been job searching to no avail. 

I haven’t been trying my absolute hardest when it comes to jobs because I have hardly any skills worth merit as far as experience is concerned. The entry level jobs in my immediate vicinity all have requirements that I can’t meet. The ones that don’t have those requirements are too far away for me to bike to. 

I don’t have my license or a car, I don’t have minutes on my phone to even call local businesses. I can’t help but feel as if it’s all my fault for quitting in the first place. My mother has a breakdown everytime something goes wrong and she feels like she can’t talk to me about anything without upsetting me. 

I keep thinking how worthless I am to my family and the job market, how all of my effort is never going to be enough and how if I just ran away and killed myself in a place where they’d never find me, I wouldn’t even have to burden them further with funeral costs. They could just assume I went missing and they’d stop looking for me eventually. They’d be able to pay for the bills, the section 8 housing would pay more of the rent without me living there. Everything would be fine for my family.",1

"I will die 1 of 3 ways. suicide, war or naturally.And I am contempt with the idea of how it will all end. No one needs to know, because no one should, even though they may care. It's not my place as a young man to express this stuff, because it's not how I should act. 

This inner peace is haunting, yet calming. I will live with these thoughts forever, and if I end my life; I end my life.

"1 Year From TodayToday is my mom’s birthday. She would have been 57 but she lost her battle to cancer a few years ago. She was my best friend and the only person I really had in my life. We grew especially close when I had to be her caretaker while she was going through treatments. But at one point she stopped progressing and eventually slipped away. 
Since losing her I’ve lost motivation to keep going. I have no purpose in life anymore. I’ve always had issues with suicidal thoughts but losing her has made it so much worse. The only reason I haven’t done it yet  is because I keep thinking things might get better.
I’ve been trying different things that I thought would help. I moved to the city and enrolled in school this fall for nursing. But I’m not sure I have what it takes to make it through. I’ve also been having trouble getting a job since I moved here. Should also mention that I am still in the closet in my late 20s because of unsupportive family which is why I thought moving away would be good for me. 
So that is where I am and why I decided that if 1 year from today things have not gotten better I would end my life. Hopefully I can find some sort of fulfillment in all of this. In the meantime I am still applying for jobs, preparing for school, and will hopefully work up the courage to try a dating app, but we will see..",1

"Things should be better, but I want to end itTldr; I am a fit, tall, intelligent dude from the midwest with a wife and loving family; but I just can’t shake the creeping thoughts of wanting to hang myself every day in our apartment.

I graduated college late with a less than stellar gpa due to switching schools and majors midway through a tech track, and ended up with a general degree that employers won’t even look at. I’ve been unemployed from my last job for about three months which was a warehouse position with a coffee roaster, in which I got let go due to performance.

Since then, I’ve sent massive amounts (&gt;150 per month) of applications out to various postings and have had one interview in the beginning of my unemployment. I have never not been without job opportunities.

I’ve stopped enjoying everything that used to help me relax or make me feel empowered, I haven’t gone to the gym more than once a week and none last week. This has led to my wife and I not having any intimate relations in the past couple of months, and I feel completely out of sync with her on everything going on.

My family is loving, but my mom is going to die soon. She has four different types of cancer, MS, and onset heart failure, and I can’t do anything to help her. I visit, but since the last episode of cardiac arrest in which she suffered prolonged oxygen depletion, she doesn’t recognize me.

I should feel like there’s hope, I just don’t or can’t. I have a degree, I’m abled bodied, I can (somewhat) string together cohesive thoughts, but I’m so disillusioned by life I don’t see a point in being here. I’m holding my wife back from living life, and wasting the time of everyone around me who’s invested in me succeeding and feeling something.
I feel like I’m displacing opportunities for those around me to find happiness, where they’re wasted on me.

I feel selfish for wanting to go, because there are so many of you who have it way worse than me. You have had brutalities enacted on you that don’t have an expression for how bad they are.",1

"I watched my dreams die in front of me and now I'm left with no hope for the future.I was training to become a pilot. I had wanted to be a pilot since I was very young, too young to even understand what a job was. I just knew that I wanted to fly. I had 150+ hours under my belt and was very nearly there. I literally was one checkride away from being a licensed pilot. A few days ago, I was diagnosed with a medical condition that prohibits me from acquiring a pilots license, and I realized then that my dreams were dead. Not postponed or delayed, dead. 

Flying was my passion. It was what I lived for. I wanted to make a career out of it. I had been going to college and taking classes relevant to flying for a living, and I have invested a massive amount of time and money in becoming a pilot. The goal of becoming a pilot was what provided me with the hope and motivation to get out of bed in the morning even when all other things in my life were falling apart, and now it's gone. I've been suicidal and depressed before, for other reasons, but now I truly feel like I have nothing left to live for. I don't have a girlfriend, I don't have a good job, I don't have a loving and caring family, and I don't have any friends, just acquaintances. I'm fat and damaged, and nobody wants to be around me for more than a few minutes. I've got nothing to fall back on. I've got nothing left. ",1

"He's going to give upMy best friend is suicidal.
The only reason he is here today is me. I am literally the only thing keeping him in this world, and that is only because he knows it would absolutely destroy me if he went.

I don't feel good about posting here, because I don't want to betray his trust, but I am going to fucking fall apart if I don't talk about it or get some help. I'm the only one to help him, but I'm nearly as fucked up as he is. I am not as hopeless as he is, nor do I feel like I'm in imminent danger right now. But I am incredibly, incredibly depressed and have spent a few hours the past few days seriously contemplating whether I want to live.

I convinced him to see a therapist, but he says he's tried and they don't work. I suggested he needs to try medication, because he has chemical issues that have been diagnosed. He doesn't want to do that because he doesn't want to change. He has no support from anyone except me.
The scariest part is when he tells me he doesn't even care. He doesn't want to try, he doesn't have any interest in getting better. He doesn't want it to. He's only not dead because he knows he would send me over the edge. He's also obliquely said that when I get better and can do without his help he'll go.

I have no idea what to say to him. He comes to me to talk and says these things that terrify me and I don't know what to do. I want to help him so much, I want to make his pain go away but I don't see where to even begin. All I can do is sit there and try to argue, but he just cycles between ""I can't"" ""It won't get better, it never does"" and ""I don't even want to."" And the hopelessness of his situation is dragging me further and further down into the pit, I can't do this alone anymore. Please help, Reddit",1

"My life has hit a new lowHere's a quick rundown of me and what's been happening lately.

- I'm gay, not out to any family. I'm to anxious to tell anyone and the thought of it scares me. I've known for a few years.
- I've come out of a long term relationship only to find out I've been cheated on during the end of it. I've lost interest and trust in other people
- My studies aren't going well. I'm dyslexic and due to be tested for ADHD. Constantly being labelled by tutors and facing threats to be kicked out. 
- I suffer from anxiety, which is typically health anxiety but also generalized anxiety. Day to day things involving communicating with others is a challenge and it's getting worse. 
- Things I enjoyed doing last year feel mundane and boring today. I've lost most interest in things I enjoyed. 
- My ""friends"" have no future prospects and would rather take drugs and have no focus on their future. People I want to be friends with don't accept me. Usually sexuality based including people who I saw as friends. 

There's so much more to this but I can't continue. Years of this shit and I've had enough. 

All this has been draining the life out of me. It's horrible. I've been trying to smile through it for ages but I'm giving up. I smoke because I want to die. Knowing that I can enjoy myself and bring myself closer and closer to the end is what drives me to not quit. I feel as if my future is heading for a dead end where I will have no escape from hell. I can't even tell my family how I feel because I cannot open up. I opened up and told one of my (good) friends everything and was on the verge of bursting into tears. Just typing this has got me to this point. 

Some days I feel like that if there was an easy, painless and quick method to end it all I'd be first in line. No hesitation. 

Worst part is I'm 17. 

I can't speak to doctors because of an ongoing phobia of anything medical-related which started when I was young. 

I need to fix this or I'm going to fall into a dark dark place ",1
"Today I really wanted to kill myselfI have been in med school for 10 years (that’s right, TEN). I just can’t graduate because of bureaucracies. I’ve been trying for more than one year but apparently everything I try just doesn’t work. Today I had everything ready for a meeting with the school board that would solve my problems but I got a call and they said that they wouldn’t accept my pledge at all. Now my only choice is 
sue the university. All my hopes fell apart instantly, I threw up at the street and considered killing myself in a cheep hotel or jumping out of a building. All my friends are very successful, traveling the world and moving out. I am the only one who is still a student. I can’t handle the pressure of everyone asking me everyday why I didn’t graduate. My family is going through a financial crisis and it reminds me that if I was already a doctor I could help somehow. I feel like I am a burden to everyone. A complete fail. I cry myself to sleep every single night. As soon as I wake up the very first thought in my head is that I wish I was dead. I just don’t want to live anymore.",1

"Do you guys notice how some commercials and shows increased their black cast/presence? Do you notice the increase of black people in commercials and television?

Just a disclaimer, I am African American. Iâ€™m sharing an observation and this isnâ€™t an invitation for a racist discussion.

2020 was a wild year when it came to racial injustice. All of these protests and demands for change made me very happy and proud.

Obviously, companies see these protests and come out in support and thatâ€™s fine. But some shows and commercials seems like pandering rather than a genuine desire to increase diversity.

I was watching a paper tower commercial and it was a black animated family. I see a lot of new shows adding a number of black people to their cast. I see Harvard pledging to admit more black students. And many other commercials that you wouldnâ€™t usually see a black face on.

This is all great until you realize that a lot of these companies only do this amid a protest that pertains to race. Iâ€™ve never seen this rush for diversity when instances are â€œnormalâ€ (normal meaning not a huge public outcry for racial reform). 

Maybe Iâ€™m reading too far into it but itâ€™s just what I noticed on television. Companies putting a black face as the star of their commercial and calling it progress. Itâ€™s upsetting and these companies should have a genuine desire to push for diversity rather than pushing for it when itâ€™s convenient to show that you support an agenda.",0
"Tired of being undesirableMy dating life is nonexistent. It is a series of rejections after the first meeting. I’m insecure, inexperienced, without much confidence

I am tired of sayings how society puts pressure to be in a relationship. I don’t feel that, I don’t care. It is my internal desire to be deeply connected with someone that is driving me mad

I could live without relationship if there was any indicator that I have a normal chance of getting into one, of having some options from time to time, of getting any interest from a girls

Online advices to learn to live peacefully without romantic life is invalidating my feelings and struggles

I don’t want to live like that, setting some hard deadline for changing the course of life seems to be a good option. That would give me some peace of mind that I won’t be in that state too long, no matter the outcome

"I tried to kill myself at 9...I should have gotten it over with then.I am 19 and have had depression for 11 years. I have been seeing therapists, psychologists, and social workers since I was 4 or 5. I have been on 10 or 12 medications. I tried to kill myself for the first time when I was 9. I have stayed in psych wards 3 or 4 times (the last time at 13).

I am so tired of being depressed. I have no energy; if I could, I would lie in bed all day. Caffeine doesn't help; I have had 400mg of it today, and it's 10PM and I'm ready to go to bed. I have no drive or motivation. Everything is flat. I just want to be normal and be able to function like other people can. I don't want to have to live like this any more. It seems like I am constantly irritable and I can't focus on anything.

I have been increasingly suicidal for about 2 weeks now, so I decided to go in to see a therapist at my college. I had earlier gone in to talk to the doctor about my medications. When I was first feeling suicidal, he doubled my medication...this made me less suicidal, but I was throwing up a lot and couldn't think straight. I also had to stop taking my other medication because I can't afford it any more. 

So, I went in to see a counselor. Basically, ~60% of his responses to me were ""Oh, that sucks"". Yes, verbatim. When I left, he said ""remember, if you need emergency help, call 911"". I told him that that wasn't financially possible for me. He said ""Oh, that sucks, doesn't it?"".

I am so tired of having to live like this. It is too much effort for too little payoff. I have no fucking energy and it is killing me. I would kill myself tonight if my roommate didn't have to find my body.",1

"Can't take it anymore..Long-story short, I'm a 26 year old guy and my 8-year relationship ended a few months ago and I've been in hell ever since. The breakup ended badly.

I practically invested my entire life into her(I know, I shouldn't have, but I trusted her..a lot). I went all-in because I had a really high amount of faith and confidence in our relationship.

So now, I'm just really lost and feel like wanting to die a few times a day. I'm angry and my only desires and objectives are from my rage. Everything I had, especially my future, I invested in her and the relationship.

I think back what I was doing before my relationship was serious and I can't even remember. I don't even know what I was doing back then. Like time just skipped and 80% of my being was taken from me. And things that I was doing when we were together, I have no desire to do anymore. That includes all my past hobbies and interests. 

I'm under an unbearable amount of stress. My financial situation is critical. I've started getting panic attacks. A lot of breath shortages and my heart constantly hurts.

I was preparing toast and just stood there with a butterknife, clutching onto it with so much force that it broke my skin. It was the only thing I could do to stop me from sticking it into the toaster. I threw the knife across the kitchen, unplugged the toaster and ran to my room. I'm so desperate and scared and I know I did the right thing by removing myself from the room, but I'm so angry that those thoughts even crossed my mind again. 

I'm so angry that I feel this way. I hate the feeling of sadness. I don't even need to be sad and my heart will just feel heavy. I need a level head because taking my usual steps to calm myself and talk myself down aren't working right now. I'm in tears and sobbing and I just don't know what to do at this point.

I've never self harmed, but I can feel my methods of keeping myself sane are becoming less and less effective. That, and I've never had anxiety, depression, and eating disorders overlap like this. It's not even a steady decline in mental health anymore, it's just a full blown nose dive.

Through the power of Reddit I was able to save my cat, but that’s not enough to save myself. I was selfish for thinking that it would be. Merlen is still at the vets office and  told them someone besides myself will contact them.I don’t plan to be here through the night.

I have nothing. I want nothing. But nothing isn’t ever enough.. 

I don’t know if you’ve ever felt a waterfall of tears pouring from your face, but it’s creates  a paper towel mess. I can’t even save my cat, I can’t save myself. 

I don’t know what to do. Life shouldn’t be this hard.

"I am commited to dying now, I dont give a shit anymore, I'm doing itThis weekend I am getting my shotgun, bring it home. On Tuesday afternoon, I am driving to the woods, getting drunk, assembling my shotgun from out of my backpack and then I am sticking it through my mouth and dying.

I will never be happy, I will never be a good person, I will never form connections with others, I will never be succesful. I am so ashamed and guilty and I am angry at myself. Ive been suicidal most of my life but only now am I not hesitant and i truly believe I will do it. Goodbye, I am sorry family",1

"I didn't commit suicideThis is a little update from my post of a few weeks back.

In the end, I didn't kill myself.

I planned everything out and I wanted to kill myself on the 10th of August, a month after the death of my friend Eli.
That day at 2 AM I woke up and went to the bathroom with a knife and stayed there for a good hour looking at myself in the mirror.

I don't know what happened but I started thinking about my family and I forgot everything for a few minutes. I was free for a few moments and that gave me hope for a future. 

Now, I'm happy to say that it's been a week and I'm not that obsessed anymore about what happened. I still have nightmares and thought about her, but not as toxic as they were.
Hopefully, it will continue, and I'll be able to free myself from depression. 

I'm now looking to reconnect with people I knew from high school and I'm ready to start a new chapter of my life. 

Thanks to everyone that tried to comfort me during that bad time, even if it didn't help per se, I really appreciated it.

"Here we go again...Ok, R., let's remember the rules -- you know, the ones that kept you from bottoming out even worse a couple months ago?

So here we go:
1. Don't drink. It never works for you anymore, and hasn't for a decade.
2. Take your psychiatric medicines as prescribed, on schedule. This is you not being in denial about the fact you have severe o.c.d. and agoraphobia.
3. Keep your weekly dinner meet up with your friend. Keep your weekly language lesson. These things help tether you at least a little to the real world.
4. Don't email your ex therapist. No matter how much you want to apologize, get support, or somehow make amends. You know it just amounts to stalking, and isn't good for you or her.

relatives and family: 
ew ew i hate them so much, my mum tells me she hates me and will make my life hell. i don’t give a fuck about that. my relatives gossip shit about me and my cousin, but like it’s ur fault we’re the same and have the same types of life, and how we’re extremely close and shit.

"I'm bipolar, and I know one day I will kill myself.I'm destroying everything around me. 
When I see myself in the mirror I don't like who looks back. My temper and rash decisions have alienated almost everyone I love. When I feel suicidal it's usually because I am in a bad moment, it passes. This is different. I am as lucid as I can be. I am not angry, or sad. I do not feel the depression that comes along with it. But I am tired. So very tired of fighting against the current. However, I am a man who keeps his promises, I promised my fiancée we would get married and that I would do my best to immigrate her to the US. It's the last promise I will make. It's the last thing that is keeping me here. She's the last good thing in my life. I live in constant fear that my disease will swallow her life and slowly destroy her like it has everyone else. I am not well. After countless treatments and medications I cannot stop the destructive impulses inside me. The day she becomes a citizen will be the day I will evaluate my life for the last time. It could be a while, but eventually I will keep my promise.
The day I was diagnosed I understood what it meant.
I can't have children, the relationship with my father is testament to that. I refuse to cause that same pain to anyone. My medication won't always be there for me. I lost my job, I lost my insurance, my income has been halved. I have to keep up my medication or my problems will get worse. Worse. Worse than being alone with no one because everyone is sick of me. Worse that knowing the one person at my side will someday see this monster I'm hiding from her. Worse than having a crisis and not having anyone to call. Worse than seeing my actions, understanding why it's happening, and not being able to stop. Worse than throwing my life away because I'm in a manic episode. Worse than not being able to get through one single day without wondering if it's worth it.
I've been bipolar for two decades. I just didn't know what it was. I thought I was right and the world was wrong. Now I know better and I haven't been able to change anything. 
Some day I will kill myself.",1

Everything just goes in loops that I'll never get out of, but the fact that I didn't actually attempt makes me tell myself it's actually not that bad. I got so close. I would have been so determined. Everything fell apart, it always does. This happens too frequently. The health service doesn't care. They toss me away and leave me for dead, they say I'm not ready for therapy. That leaves suicide as the only option left, but they vilify me for that too. I can't win in life, I can't win in death. But at least in death I can't feel the wrath of others when they blame me.",1

"I intend to do it tonightI'm going to sum this up quickly so that we don't have a wall of text.

I have no memory of before I was 11, diagnosed with PTSD, likely from parents.  Parents love me now, as well as two older sisters, but I'm in too much pain.

At 16 after first attempt to hang myself, diagnosed with extreme depression and anxiety. Shortly after, found out I was having 300 petit mal seizures per day and no one had noticed.  Got medicated. Helped to a degree.

Still felt suicide was inevitable. Went to college. Did well, but no passion. Only there because it was expected. In final year, tried marijuana. Best thing. Gave me will to live for first time. Months later, got caught. On probation. Have to be clean.

Was going to kill myself, had some weed out of desperation. Failed next urine test. Told if I fail again it will be sent back to court. Feel trapped, can't think straight.

Strange thing happened, old coping mechanism, strange change in personality, no empathy, manipulate others for own survival. Had not been used since childhood, had no wisdom. Did research on probation officer only to help me to feel less powerless, no malicious intent. Let it slip that I did so.

Called probation officer today, transferred to new one. Ordered to do no research on employees. Frightens and intimidates me. Cannot do this anymore. Too much stress, took away only outlet.  No friends. One sort of friend, only likes me to try to have sex.


Wrote goodbye note. Figured plan. Did research to make sure. No mistakes this time.  Would live, but can think of no way forward that does not involve too much pain to be worth it. Never did much enjoy life, why bother going through emotional torture to live when I don't want to?",1
"Im so fucking worried that i did something wrong to my friends But I don't remember doing anything bad, I mean, i never ask them for weed, or money, or anything like that. I never talk shit about them. I never argue with them. So wtf?!

But suddenly, my closest friend stopped talking to me. The only fucking reason they even acknowledged me is because I offered them alcohol first

And now, my other friends stopped talking to me, too. Theres only 5 people left in my entire fucking school, who I'm not even that close with, (of like 30 people) who acknowledge I exist. Even some of the teachers act like I don't exist

Some of them legit just stare through me. I can't fucking handle this again

I'm so fucking confused at what's going on and idk what to do, I'm gonna ask my old closest friend if I did anything wrong tomorrow, but what's next?

"29 year old man with daughter with special needs dies, and baby mother is after my life.She obviously is going through a hard time but treated the baby daddy like shit til the very end. He died. I dropped everything to help the mom and daughter. I cleaned her house, did her laundry, my friend spent hundreds on take out for weeks for her, she used and abused us. She said in plain text she wanted to die. She did not respond when I called over and over for a half hour. Had no choice but to call police for a wellness check.

She’s been conning my friend before her baby daddies death to give her money when she doesn’t have a job and was exposed on Turtle Boy for insults she publicly posted about her now deceased baby daddy. I spent time money energy out of the goodness of my heart for her and her daughter. I found disturbing things like dried out turds under her daughters bed that had been there for longer than her dad died. The house was a disaster and I pampered her mom and tried to be strong for her daughter who won’t eat and has anger issues like her mother.

What do me and my friend get? We are told we are ugly, she is glad my father and bf are dead, that “I took her daughter away” which I didn’t. But a psych EMT picked up the phone after I already received nasty texts in paragraphs with the most lowest blows at that point because we were terrified she was dead, and didn’t want her daughter to find her no less. She’s shady as fuck cuz she pops benzos and seraquil among other substances and manipulates people into giving her sympathy money. She’s literally a very psycho stalker person who is threatening to ruin my life once she’s out of the hospital. She said she prays I die and will laugh when I do. She threatened to hurt me too so police will be involved. But she can’t be stopped to slander me online as she’s threatened. She’s pissed many people off before her and yes the EMT asked about what it was like taking care of her daughter and I mentioned the filth and neglect that had been apparent for a while MAYBE because she needs psychiatric help. She knows people and could do whatever. Tires slashed you name it. She is nothing short of vindictive.

Sorry the police were called because you threatened to end your life. ",1

It's not my first go-around with this feeling.


I'm online looking for info (best way to do it, least painful, etc). It seems like the prevailing attitude about suicide is ""don't do it! life's worth living"" etc.


I just don't get it though. Isn't that a personal opinion? Why should anyone have to suffer more than they want to?


We're all going to die eventually. Why do the vast majority of people seem to insist on making EVERYONE else go through the motions?

I started using cocaine when I was 17 then meth when I was 19 at 21 I  had a phyciotic breakdown after doing pcp, meth,kodiene, and alcohol all in one night got thrown in detox by the police. Walked out of detox. Police picked me up I got to the hospital and was held for a mental assessment after I was detoxed in seclusion for a month. So I was held on a mental ward for another month after seclusion while I was there a social worker helped me get on disability and go to a rehab program.  I was in rehab for six months and lived in a second stage house through the rehab for a year. Then I got a girlfriend and moved into a place with her. She never had a job or contributed but I still cared for her. 7months of living together and complaining she doesn't like the city we are in so finally I accept her concerns and we move to a bigger city. We live in a house with 16 other people for three months filled with drugs and violence (I lived in the shed for awhile with my girlfriend haha) then we moved in with her friend and her boyfriend then my girlfriend starts fighting with her friend (me and the dude stayed cool and we were the ones paying the bills). So I couldn't take the hostility and I moved back home and drug my girlfriend with me. We moved to her friends in the hood as she was a single mother and had an extra room for us. Then it all went South. Drugs started coming into the house and I wanted nothing to do with it. I escaped to my best friend's house as much as I could and hid in my bedroom. Then one day my girlfriend after she was up all night high with her friend told me she thinks it's best for me to move out so I freak out because I pay the rent..... In the end I went to my best friend's and him and my other friend let me move in instantly. She was no longer my girlfriend I have three years of sobriety. I'm medicated for my mental disorders. I still live with my best friend. But I can't seem to talk to girls anymore it seems like now that I don't do drugs or talk to anyone who does girls aren't interested. I can't get off my ass to get working again and I'm living off disability.  I literally think about how worthless my life is everyday.

I cant see the light at the end. Doesn’t seem there will ever be one. And even when lockdowns are over, people are gonna be masked and wary of each other.

The future just seems bleak and lonely now. Like what’s the point? I thought the world was ruined before but now it really feels that way.

I wish I could’ve been with someone before all this. Im with family but everyone keeps to themselves and it feels like everyone is sick of each other.

She said, and I quote, ""I'm afraid I'm going to get used to not talking to you and get used to talking to someone else"". This ate me up inside; absolutely killed me. The initial shock from her saying she didn't know what she wanted to do at this point in our year and a half relationship was nothing compared to that sentence right there. For the first time in years, I broke down and cried. Like a goddamn baby. After the tears came the flow of anger. WHY CAN'T SHE JUST GIVE THIS A SHOT? DOES SHE NOT HAVE FAITH IN US ANYMORE? WHAT THE FUCK DID I DO WRONG? I can't handle losing her and honestly this is making me think the Air Force might have been a mistake. Everyone has said to put my faith in God, but no matter how hard I try to believe, I see nothing. I see no hope, no salvation. I'm down on my knees begging for something. A sign.

"18 and just want to disappear as soon as possible.To make a long story short, I feel like shit and college doesn’t make me feel any better. Aside from this, I’ve never loved myself. Middle school dropped my self-esteem to the ground and now I can’t imagine anyone wanting to be with me. I’m struggling with my sexuality and my parents are homophobic so I can’t imagine coming out going well for me. I tried talking to my mom about how I was literally about to end everything and kill myself last semester but I just got yelled at and called ungrateful. She told me that people go through tougher shit than I have and that her and my dad are too busy to deal with my issues now. I’m always there for my friends when they’re down and I don’t talk to them about my issues because I don’t want to drag them down. I feel like I’m at a dead end right now and just want this semester to end already so that I can have at least some of this weight off of my shoulders. I tried therapy for about 2 years a while back and it was working but my parents made me feel shitty for going because each meeting with my therapist cost $60, so they took me out of it because it was expensive. I want to end everything but I don’t want my family to have to pay for funeral expenses and have them traumatized for life. I don’t want to leave my friends behind because I know that my death would definitely take a toll on them. Last semester, I was in an even shittier place to the point where I actually walked around my campus looking for big buses or trucks driving around so that I could jump into them and get killed, but the guilt of scaring the driver and those around me at that moment was too much for me to handle. I do feel better now but I can feel myself sinking again. I just don’t know what to do right now and I’m lost. There might be grammar errors in this but I don’t care. I just want to talk to someone, please. I don’t know what to do and I feel like a lost cause; it really seems like I will only last 18 years if I keep this roller coaster of emotions up.",1
"My old house gave me my first suicidal thoughtsI was going to make an alt account for this but decided that it doesn't matter.

I've been depressed for about, I'd say 5 years? Maybe 6? I've stopped counting. I don't really know how it started, or rather I don't remember. I used to be so happy. No matter what I was never as sad as I am now. We just moved into a new house, my dad and I, when it started. We didn't move towns or anything, same town, same school, same friends. The house was quite nice as well, not the best but it definitely wasn't terrible. Back then it was just sadness. I didn't want to die, or distance myself from others because I felt I didn't deserve them, I didn't have abandonment issues.

 It wasn't until about a year later when I started thinking about suicide. I pretty much lived in my room upstairs, it's not like I had anything else to do. My window was technically the highest in the house. I can't tell you how many times I looked out that window and thought about jumping. It would be so easy, to just open it and jump. One second of fear, then it would be over. No more sadness. No more anger. No more pain. Just sweet and silent nothingness. I used to dangle my feet outside and sit on the window sill, wondering if anyone would even notice. I would always get as close to the edge as I could without falling. Sometimes I hoped that I would slip. 

I haven't attempted suicide since then, and I don't know if I ever will. I've harmed myself multiple times, I still have a scar on my arm from the only time I've ever cut myself. I have a lot of bruises on my thighs from pinching. I don't know what to do anymore. I can't seem to find any meaning to my life. I think the only reason I haven't offed myself yet was because of how my family would handle it. I'm not sure how long I can keep doing this for. I'm so tired.",1
"Follow-up to suicideAfter [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fztcz/where_the_fuck_do_i_go_back_to) I tried to kill myself, but did not succeed. So I'm still here, but still depressed and suicidal. I tried killing myself again last week with pills, but again, it didn't work. I fail at self-harm. I find that funny. And sad. I have a shotgun and ammo but don't want to use it because the idea of leaving that big of a bloody mess behind is abhorrent. 

I've tried years of therapy and drugs for my depression, but the bottom line is that I'm an awful, ugly person and nobody likes my personality. My only friend is my SO, but even he doesn't like me. I talk too much, I care about and talk about stuff that nobody cares about, and I get frustrated and defensive. I just don't see the point anymore. 

I think my SO is still with me because he's lonely and doesn't want to be on his own, so he tolerates me and that's it. He's also about as observant as a paper bag so he had no idea that I even tried to kill myself ever until last week. He asked why I was so sick and sleeping all day and I told him the truth, finally. As usual he didn't know how to be supportive and so he just kept playing his video games. He doesn't want to be with me, but being alone is worse than being with me, I guess. 

Oh well. Maybe next time. 

TL;DR: I've failed at killing myself twice in the past month. I'm a bad person, I don't have any friends, and I don't have anything to live for anymore.",1

"Killing myself after I post thisHey everyone. I made a throwaway so if I do survive I donâ€™t have to live with the shame of seeing this in my post history. I had no one to say goodbye to so Iâ€™m saying goodbye to a bunch of strangers. Like a weirdo.
Iâ€™m 16, and I know people might think I still have time to turn my life around, Iâ€™ve heard it all by now. Therapy, pills, friends, psych wards, whatever the fuck you name, Iâ€™ve tried it. Itâ€™s all bullshit. Life is bullshit. I have been abused at home since I was 3 years old by an alcoholic mother, who is now using my little brother as a second chance at â€œraising someone who isnâ€™t a worthless eyesoreâ€. I canâ€™t bear to look at her putting all her hope of raising someone whoâ€™s not gonna waste away in a filthy room for weeks while not speaking and staring at a wall into such a young child. People think itâ€™s jealousy, itâ€™s not. I know sheâ€™s going to crush all his hopes and dreams when he grows up, and I canâ€™t bear to wait to see it happen like it did to me.
I used to have dreams once. I wanted to be an artist. Cliche as fuck, but it was my dream and I was set on it. Everyone hadnâ€™t my back except for the one person who I needed the most. She pushed me aside for cocaine and vodka. She burned all my art when I was 8 and beat me until I said I wanted to be a lawyer or doctor, forgot which one. I had 5 broken ribs and she had dislocated most of my right half in the process of throwing me around like a rag doll ( I still have issues with joints dislocating to this day). My nose broke and she almost blinded me with glass from a bottle, so yeah, that dream was crushed. At age 9, I was made to cook and clean for myself. She didnâ€™t lift a finger to help me while I scalded my whole lower half with a pot of boiling water, instead laughing at me and blaming me in the ER after the neighbors called the police due to my screaming and crying. I still have scars from that which I get bullied for. I never had a single friend in school, I was the quiet, poor kid who always smelled weird and cried all day. 
At age 12, I fell in with the wrong crowd and Iâ€™m still addicted to cigarettes, which is tame compared to other shit I did back then. I was raped by 6 people in the space of an hour, and since then I have not had a period (no Iâ€™m not pregnant). I gave up on school and I just sit there blankly all day or just donâ€™t show up, for which my mother beats me, and even my therapist gave up on me and cancels every appointment we have last minute.
Now Iâ€™m sitting on my bed after taking around 6 bottles of sleeping pills (I stocked up, yay), waiting for them to kick in and typing this. No one is going to miss me. Not a single person. I didnâ€™t leave a note. Thereâ€™s no point since my mother will throw it away when she finds me. Hopefully hell doesnâ€™t exist since Iâ€™m definitely gonna end up there if it does. 
I had a good run. Thanks for reading everyone.",1

"The Gun Never LiesThere was this scene in [Man of Fire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emL9GGweB0I). Where, in his case, at his lowest point, he pulls the trigger and the bullet doesn't detonate. A light primer strike. His character says later, a bullet never lies. 

I shoot. Quite a bit. A logical man doesn't buy a $1,500 pistol, tricked out in every way to compete at the pinnacle of his ability... and throw it all away by turning that finely tuned piece of precision engineering on himself. 

Something to note about the CZ-75 / P 01 design, is it passed the Czech reliability requirements, and then blew them away. 

**Czech REQUIREMENTS**

Must be able to complete the following without failure:

* 4000 dry firings
* 3000 De-cockings
* Operator level disassembly 1350 times with out ware or damage to components.
* Complete disassembly 150 times
* 100% interchangeability, any number of pistols randomly selected, disassembled, parts mixed and reassembled with no failures of any kind including loss of accuracy.

**Safety requirements:**

* 1.5 meter (4.9”) drop test, this is done 54 times with the pistol loaded (blank) and the hammer cocked. Dropping the pistol on the butt, the muzzle, back of the slide, sides of the gun, top of the slide, in essence, any angle that you could drop the gun from. This is done on concrete and 0 failures are allowed! A failure is the gun firing.

* 3 meter drop (9.8”) 5 times with the pistol loaded (blank) and the hammer cocked, This is done on concrete and 0 failures are allowed! A failure is the gun firing.

* After these tests are complete the gun must fire without service. 


The factory contracted an independent lab to do additional testing on guns that previously passed the drop tests.

**These pistol were dropped an additional 352 times without failure.**

**The pistol must also complete an environmental conditions test**

* This means cold, heat, dust/sand and mud. 

* The pistol must fire after being frozen for 24 hours at –35C (-36F). 

* The pistol must fire after being heated for 24 hours at 70C (126F) 

* The pistol must fire after being submerged in mud, sand and combinations including being stripped of oil then completing the sand and mud tests again.

**Service life:**

* The service life requirement from the Czech police was 15,000 rounds of +P ammo. 

* The pistol will exceed 30,000 rounds with ball 9mm.

**Reliability:**

The reliability requirements for the P-01 pistol are 99.8%, that’s a .2% failure rate. This equals 20 stoppages in 10,000 rounds or 500 “Mean Rounds Between Failure” (MRBF) **During testing, the average number of stoppages was only 7 per 15,000 rounds fired, this is a .05% failure rate, a MRBF rate of 2142 rounds**! Over 4 times the minimum acceptable requirement. 
The U.S. Army MRBF requirement is 495 rounds for 9mm pistols with 115 grain Ball ammunition.


All this was to say, when I loaded a magazine of 10 bullets into the magazine, mostly out of habit, as production division shooters are limited to 10 rounds, I did so intentionally. Carefully. 

Thousands of reloads. Thousands of draws from a holster. Thousands of hours dry firing, tuning muscle memory and mechanics. Hundreds of thousands of bullets fired. 

This was just one more A zone shot. Nothing to it. 

Chamber one. Do a brass check. Safety on. Holster

I even set the buzzer. Random delay, par time 1.3 seconds. Figure why give myself a chance to second guess myself, and just let instinct take over. Beat the clock. 

BEEP!

Right hand moves down to the gun and finds the grip. Left hand moves instinctively to my chest, awaiting a freestyle grip I never intended to use today. My right thumb flipping off the left safety as the gun pulls out of the molded kydex holster. The gip is good. Solid. High on the beaver tail. 

Instinct has me bringing the gun up to face a target, moving to meet my support hand. it takes a moment. Only 2 tenths of a second, but I force the gun to the target. Finger has begun to slowly squeeze the trigger rearward, all pre-travel gone. 2 lbs is all it takes in single action. The hammer dropped. Clunk. 

BEEEP! 

I never expected to hear the par time buzzer. I checked the round, no firing pin mark. The hammer was stopped halfway. I stripped the gun. There is some play in the sear cage. It was a repeatable error with the right grip on the right safety. 

The gun never lies. 

Not today.

My Mom hates me because she found messages i had sent to my friends about her and a private rant that I had written about her (shes kinda abusive) I had to block all contact with my friends so she couldn't look through the rest of my messages with them.  I've always kinda thought about killing myself and idk it seems like everyone hates me and things are in a horrible place right now. My parents are fighting my mom is gonna try to leave and take me with her to who knows where.

"My kid will probably not be able to see us (his parents) for his 21st birthday due to COVID and the fact that his school is in a different state (it borders our state) than where we live. What should I do to cheer him up? My kid is a junior in college (without a car on campus) and will probably not be able to see us (his parents) for his 21st birthday due to COVID. Usually, we celebrate his birthday a week later because his birthday is a week before his school goes on spring break. This year he has no spring break, or any break that he would usually come home for. 

He hasnâ€™t had the best roommates when it comes to celebrating his birthday with him. Freshman yea he didnâ€™t have a roommate 2nd semester. Sophomore year he had a roommate who was controlling and didnâ€™t let him watch tv on his (roommates) tv at all and had to be quiet after 8:00 pm. He (roommate) said it was due to medical issues but I donâ€™t believe that 100% because if he really needed it to be quiet after 8:00 pm he should have been living by himself.

&amp;#x200B;

What can I do to make him feel better on his birthday? His school does nothing for birthdays. Every time I talk to him about it he starts to tear up and either leaves the room or changes the subject. For the past two years I sent him balloons and chocolates from this local place near his school. I'm not sure if I can do that this year because of COVID. I think I will be able to but I'm not sure.",0

A person who's very important to me wants to commit suicide. This is not the first time the topic arise and they have tried it before meeting me.

I have always tried to encourage them and be supportive. However, they say that people should understand that they don't want to live anymore.

That's where the question in the title comes from. If they feel there is no place for them in this Earth, they have no purpose, they feel the only way out is suicide, isn't t selfish to make them live? Make them live in the sense of putting them in a mental ward and stuff.

"I want everyone here to know that you are loved by more than you can imagine.Recently, one of my friends took a jump and ended his life for who knows why. Maybe he was depressed or not satisfied and couldn’t fill some void.. I really don’t know. This kid was great. Star football player in high school, came from a good family, played college football, had tons of friends, got most girls.. seemingly had it all. He drank a lot, but always acted so upbeat and happy. Was so easy to make friends with, super outgoing, the whole nine. He must know how many people loved him and yet he still felt something inside that was eating away at him every day. (at least so I assume).. 25 years old, just got a great job as an elementary school teacher. He was so good with people. It’s really hard to wrap my head around honestly. Kid had such a great life. 

I just don’t want this to happen to any of you. Regardless of what you’ve gone through, good or bad, you have purpose here. I promise.

Everyone is truly special in their own way. All we have in this life is life itself. Perspective is everything. You can be happy. It may take time, but you can enjoy life. There is help. You are loved. You have people in this world who would be devastated to lose you and their lives wouldn’t ever be the same without you.

"Suicide as a rational decision?I’m so sorry for any victims of friends or family members who have committed, a terrible tragedy to endure someone you love making this decision, and I hope it not callous to talk about but it is what is on my mind. 

In what instance is it acceptable, or understandable, or even met without protest ones suicide? 

I’m embarrassed, like with every therapist, with every girlfriend, with every close friend that asks - I’m embarrassed to do this pathetic “tragedy comparison” and “tragedy listing” to justify my pissy mood and suicidal ideation. I hate it. 

But we all do it, and we’re right to do it because it’s what we feel. 

So here I go with my own personal pity party, and I hope it doesn’t come across as me sort of making a great adventure of my life, or going about in pity, as I hate that shit. For anyone reading I’d like them to have a context. 

My father choked and hit me the other night. I told my therapist and he insisted I press charges, but I didn’t want to. My mother, grandmother, grandfather DONT believe me - my word doesn’t matter. My meth’d out brother held me at gunpoint this year, and ever since I called the cops on him none of my sisters will speak to me. They consider me a traitor to the family, and a garbage little brother. 

I lost my job because my dad wouldn’t drive me to work. Despite our monetized promise he would take me to work he got blackout drunk, and when I was to arrive at 7 30 that is only when we left because he decided to brush his teeth and shower, knowing full well I had been ready since 7. He moved slowly as he could. 

My ex girlfriend got an abortion because she was disgusted by my family. She hated my father, she hated my brother, and most of all she hated my sisters because they ostracized me for calling the cops on my brother. She was there when he threatened me at gunpoint. She was threatened by the same gun as a pregnant woman. She decided, rightfully, not to be with me and my crazy family anymore. 

I’ve attempted suicide 14 times in the past year and a half and none have worked. Mostly pills and hangings. I’m heavy set and muscular, not that that matters, except for I seem to tear doors and tree branches down when my body jerks and resists. 

I can’t die from pills. I’ve overdosed on anti anxieties and zoplicone dozens of times - even one time being arrested because an officer thought my intentional overdose was me being “belligerently drunk in public”. 

My family is gone. My ex has left me. I haven’t my job anymore. And none of these things are coming back. 

To boot, lately I’ve had terrifying nightmares every night. Torture and pain, unlike the last 20 years I now am more often woken in a cold sweat and complete terror. I also in my waking life experience flashes of suicide - of myself dying - I see it all the time. I don’t get it, either. I just see myself hanging, of the sweet release of death, I can see myself choking on a belt by the door and when I see it it feels very good. 

I want to die so badly. I want this all to be over. I want it to end. I want you to help me make it end. 

These are the things I can’t say to my therapist. I have been hospitalized for suicide twice. Sometimes I have suicidal or violent thoughts. Sometimes I want to talk to someone about it, but can’t, because at the smallest mention of those things there is legal intervention and what I’d consider a “time out” in a hospital until you’re “okay”.

"This quote helps distract me, putting it out there in case it helps someone else""I am at the crossroads between waking and dream. One path leads back to the world I left behind. The other path … the other path leads to a place of shadows. Between the familiar and the unknown, between certainty and doubt, my choice would seem obvious. Any sane man would turn around, return to the world he knows, forget what he has learned, and live his life in blissful ignorance. But in truth, it is too late. My choice was made many years ago, when I first embarked on this journey. I cannot turn back. I am at a crossroads, but for me there is only one path. I leave behind these words in the hope that, someday, they will serve as a map for someone else. To whomever reads this, Godspeed on your journey."" -Dreamfall Chapters

"I just can't take it anymore - when I get hope I get put down againI am in my late 20s - I've been struggling with depression and anxiety for years, since childhood. It comes and goes but lately I've been especially depressed. I have a physical disability that allows me to be self sufficient but is quite pronounced, affects my mental and physical well being. Nonetheless I have attended university, I have a stable job, good friends. Materially I don't struggle.

But lately I feel like I just wither away, both mentally and physically. I don't know if it's the depression or the side effects from meds, but I feel like I have gotten dumber, I have trouble concentrating. I've changed meds, mentally I've felt really better but it made my physical condition worse. I have accepted that's the price I will be willing to take.

Well today apparently one of my limbs decided to give out and there's a pretty big chance it's osteoarthritis or something similar and permanent. Can't really know because COVID will make a trip to doctor now quite impossible.

I am done fighting. When I feel bad I always try to cling to the hope that stuff will get better, that it's just temporary. But won't, I will just slowly die and get more debilitated both physically and mentally. And it seems that now apart from mental pain, I will also have to add physical pain to the list. I won't watch myself go on benefits, become a burden and turn into a shell of the potential I had in life if I didn't lose in the genetic lottery. Better go out while I still can, while I still live a relatively normal life. It will probably suck for my family for a while but eventually they will get over it. I am just tired of constantly fighting some part of my body, be it brain or something else.",1

"Does walking only part of the way to the spot of death count as a suicide attempt?On Monday at around 2 in the morning, I walked towards a train station near where I live, with the intention of killing myself by running in front of the express trains that travel through the station at full speed. However, as I got about a third of the way there, I became exhausted and decided that finishing the trip wasn't worth it. I then turned around and walked back home.

I know the answer to this question might seem obvious to you guys, but ever since it happened I just haven't been able to figure it out. Does this count as a suicide attempt, even if I didn't get anywhere close to the thing I intended on killing myself with? Thanks.",1

"I think I attempted suicide...MaybeI always've been pessimistic about life and everything, but past couple of years everything has gone to shit. I've been without a job for over two years, I'm back at my mom's home, I have the equivalent of $500 bucks right now, from selling my phone and buy an used one, and my girlfriend is buying me food to keep me going. I'm 27 and I can really feel the pressure of ""getting my life together"" from every side, even from myself.

&amp;#x200B;

Truth be told the only reason I haven't done it yet is because of my girlfriend and the support she gives, but if it wasn't for her I guess my fucked up expectations wouldn't let me sleep. I've also been having one the worst weeks. I've been locked up at the apartment for the past five days, GF was away for work during the weekend, she gives lectures all over the country. She came home on sunday, I picked her up on the airport and went to her place, she was super tired so we just hanged out a little and I came back home. 

&amp;#x200B;

I couldn't sleep, just wanted to sleep and the anxiety and self-depreciation started hitting, I've felt this many times before. But lately it's being getting worse, and I've lost my hopes of actually making things work. 10 long years of this same bullshit, same repeating thoughts, same voices saying I'm worthless. Yesterday, a new one came up, a thought that actually makes me tear up just by thinking of it again. ""My girlfriend doesn't deserve this shit"" 

&amp;#x200B;

She wants to have a family, and kids and the whole happy family package. But I'm never gonna fit on that, actually I'm gonna destroy her dreams by being pessimistic every day, shattering every bit of hope, alienating myself and and her from other people and just being a burden for her.  If we eventually get a kid, he will probably be fucked up by my genetics or worse, I will contaminate the poor kid with my depression and be a shitty father cause I'm to depressed to care for my own child. 

&amp;#x200B;

I live by the beach, and yesterday after basically that line of thought up above, I waited for everyone to go to sleep and by 2 AM I went to the beach with the intention of running up in the water swimming as far as I could, then swimming some more until I couldn't feel my legs and then swim more until I couldn't feel my arms, for then to pass out in the sea. The beach around here also has the largest shark attack probability of the continent, so maybe I would get bitten by a shark and bleed out.

&amp;#x200B;

I went to the beach, put my feet on the water and chickened out. I guess some survival instinct still kicking, and sited there for about two hours trying to gather the courage to go in the water and end it all, until I appeared out of nowhere asking if I had drugs to give him.

&amp;#x200B;

I came back home, and slept through the whole day, over 16 hours of sleep. I've just waked up and is already dark again. I don't know if I will go to the beach again to finally do it, but I'm sure as hell thinking about it. I tried looking about a therapist, but I don't even have the money to go through with it and I don't want to go to someone who will fuck me up even more. I'm more scared of being numbed out by pills forever, than dying at this point. Is this even an attempt? Am I just being a drama queen about everything? How the fuck do you stop being depressed and get a functional life?

"Differentiating between my own suicidal thoughts and those that might be caused by medication?Not sure if this is the right place to post this or not. Basically, a month ago I talked to my primary care doctor about my depression feeling worse the last few months. We decided to try increasing the dose on one of my medications to see if that would help. I then proceeded to have a very rough month (like, a month where rough things happened, not just a month where the depression was worse).

I've noticed that I've had a lot more suicidal thoughts than usual for me this month. Unfortunately, that is often what happens when I am having a rough time. I'm not really 'in crisis' exactly, not mentally writing out a suicide note or looking into buying a gun, but the thoughts have been frequent enough and serious enough that I am alarmed, despite having a long history of suicidal thoughts without any attempts.

What I'm not sure about is whether or not this is ""just"" because I've had a rough month on top of being in a definite down-cycle, or if this is that side effect of anti-depressants I've always heard about, but never experienced before. (that they can cause an increase in suicidal thoughts)

Basically, I'm not sure if I should talk to my doctor about it or not. If she were a shrink, I would, but since she's just my primary care doctor, and since I don't have a history of acting on suicidal thoughts, I'm not sure if it's worth the risk of informing her. I don't want to end up on suicide watch at the hospital. On the other hand, I don't really feel any less depressed *and* there's been an increase in suicidal thoughts, so I feel like I need to change medications, rather than just have the dose increased. My concern is that if I *don't* mention the suicidal thoughts, she'll tell me to give it another month, since it can take a while for the meds to reach full effect. Normally that'd be fine, but I'm on Medicaid, and I made more money this year, so now that I've filed taxes, I'm pretty sure I'm about to have to change insurance plans, which based on my experience last time will probably take 1-3 months before I can make appointments again. (before anyone suggests that I see a shrink - this is why I haven't tried to make an appointment with one already)

I hate that I can't trust my own feelings. It's hard enough trying to figure out where to draw the line between ""me"" and ""depression"" without also adding in ""medication side-effects"" as a third factor. Any advice is appreciated. My follow-up appointment is on Thursday.",1

sleeping has become more and more difficult as i lay in bed and a sudden wave of “holy fuck i need to do it” hits me.

deep down i don’t want to act on these thoughts and just want them to stop. i’ve tried medication in the past and it made me feel worse.

"So my father’s birthday is coming up.Today, I was talking to a friend about how she woke up this morning.. well yesterday morning and all she could think about was how broken I’ve become in the past week. It started awful and progressively has gotten worse. I mentioned how I’ve planned to kill myself next Thursday July 19th because I have no reason to live.

We talked for an hour, and I had mentioned how things have gotten worse for me. How I act as if the world were to take me before the time I have chosen for myself then I’d be okay with that. With walking down a busy road on the 4th of July just hoping I’d fall down and somebody would run me over; to when my sister asked me when I was gonna get a job I told her “it doesn’t matter, It’s not like I’ll have the job for more then 10 days anyways” my usual response to that question is, I’d lose money that way because I wouldn’t get disability checks anymore, and I’d be making way less then what I get in a month.

Eventually she said that dying isn’t the answer, to which I quickly responded. “It might not be the answer, but it is ‘an answer.’” If I wasn’t in the place I currently am in life I would’ve said how, it is the right answer if I was in an accident; and another person with my blood type was also in the same accident and they only had enough blood to save one of us. That I would choose for the other person to get the blood. However I was far too depressed to say that at the time.

Eventually we started talking about how the only things I currently want is for closure, and to kill my self. So I will try to get said closure later on today. I thanked her for her words, as it is better to express my thankfulness then to say a half assed sorry because this desire to die is so deeply rooted into me now.

Later on, I had called my father as I haven’t spoken to him before the month had began. He asked me okay, but I hesitantly said “yes, I am.” Ashamed of having to hide this from the family member I care the most about. I believe he sensed that something was wrong because he kept asking me how I was doing and my yeahs quickly grew weaker and harder to muster. During the call he had told me, that his birthday is coming up this Wednesday, and he also spoke of him coming to pick me up so I can spend the summer with him; as well as teach me how to drive.

Now, later on in the day I was play fighting with my nephew. When it hit me, in a simple 10 days from now. We might never do this again. Later today, it might change every thing.. and I might pull through and want to live. This is my last chance though, and weary that it will actually work. Either way, if this doesn’t work out.. I’ll have July 19th coming up, as I’ve had this planned for over 2 months now.",1

One of them tries really hard, He’s really sweet to me but sometimes I feel like he gives up because I just never seem to get better and the worse thing to me about him is that I have gained feelings for him, feelings that I’ve never had for anyone else (I’m gay btw) but he is straight so he would never feel the same way I’ve accepted that but I’m not accepting the fact that even he is giving up and I think they won’t even be impacted by my death. I think the main reason I’m like this is because my mom, she has verbally abused me for years now telling me I’m useless stupid never gonna be anything and that I’m just a waste, and now that some of my friends joke about it  and/or giving up I don’t think anyone would even care if I died there is no reason for me, my mom is right though I can’t even manage to do good in school, whenever I do try I still fail she also forces me to do activities I don’t want to do. Anyway I just wanted to get this off my chest. This is all I’ve wanted to say tonight bye.",1

"Reaching the end of my rope for the sixth time :'(I lost my mother ten years ago to suicide. Afterwards I started following her example; I began cutting myself and that eventually led my first attempt several years ago. Since then I've tried four more times, been hospitalized twice, and lost many friends. I'm currently in Canada visiting a friend and the feelings of emptiness and despair are reaching catastrophic levels and I don't think I can talk to my friend anymore about it. She has been dealing with so much and she pretty much told me she doesn't know how to help me and I can just tell she's so exhausted because of me. I can't call the suicide hotline because my phone has no service in this country. I'm scared and shaking and don't know what to do :'(",1
"So i really really need some help on this, badly. Please...my friend tried to commit suicide once before, he failed. Now his girlfriend left him and he's suicidal again, i love the kid. I don't want him to kill himself, it would destroy me. The reason for his suicidal thoughts is that he feels alone, he can't get a job because he dropped out of high school because of family problems. On top of that he's black and as much as people won't admit it, people are racist in NY. He has no criminal record. If anyone, i mean anyone knows of a job or place that he can go to please let me know. Anything that can keep him occupied (volunteering/etc) Also anything i should say to him or anything, i mean absolutely anything. Please come forth...Thank you..",1

I dont see anything special in what there is in that. We all do the same thing just to one day get married? have kids? work a job? I dont see any importance in doing it, it doesnt make you special and you dont have any difference from anyone else. So why do I have to continue you on with that?",1

"My roommate/ex-GF is trying to commit suicideWe were living together when we broke up last year. I left but came back to support her. The break-up happened during a bad time for her financially. She was unemployed and is just starting to find a new job. She does have a new partner by then already but she is not yet comfortable living with him (one of the reasons why we decided to part ways is that guy btw). When I came back at around September last year, I ‘kinda wanted to win her back but that died down and realized I just really wanted to help.

Fast forward to now, covid-19 happened and she is in a bad place again with her job  due to the quarantine and decided to break up with her partner. Childhood trauma of being trapped and being denied from her “distractions” is taking a huge toll on her mental health. Then her old feelings for me resurfaced. She then said she still loves me and wants me back. I said to her in pure honesty that I cannot and she is just probably feeling confused due to her being trapped with me. She’s forcing it upon me but I really cannot do it anymore. These are her main reasons on why she wants everything to end.

Now I feel trapped and I do not know what to do. I cannot make myself to pretend that there is still a chance between us just to make things better. Am losing sleep and needed to skip work a couple of times just to be on guard with her. She tried to run towards the balcony and was able to stop her twice already which really rattled me and making me paranoid. She is preventing me from messaging her relatives and I feel obliged to comply because it might make things worst if I do.

I just don’t know what to do anymore. I am getting tired everytime she goes through a bad episode.",1
I'm reviewing the first episode of Crazy Ex Girlfriend and people all the signs that Rebeca is bordeline and potentially suicidal were there. I love a well -tied script series.,0
"I’m tired of fighting, and I feel like giving up.This is going to be a long post, so I’m sorry in advance! I also cross posted this in an addiction subreddit. I just needed to get this out to someone because my boyfriend’s phone is turned off and I always turn to him in times like this. 

About 2 weeks ago, after struggling with staying sober for a year and a half along with lifelong mental illnesses, I overdosed on alcohol and as many pills as I could take. I blacked out at some point and lost track of how many I took after I reached 3100mg. I ended up throwing up a ton that night, and woke up the next morning feeling like I hated myself even more. I decided to check myself into a residential rehab, and picked one out that was about 3 hours away from me.

I got to the ER for detox, not feeling like I needed to be there at all and there was no reason why I couldn’t just go straight to the rehab. Well, those withdrawals wasted no time in proving me wrong. I was miserable, I begged to go to the ER at nights because of the pain but the nurses refused, because of my history of everyday opiate abuse. I hated the nurses in that crisis unit so bad, but the doctors were helpful. The day before I was to be discharged, I felt pretty good. I had unfortunately found out the residential rehab was way out of my budget, but I was set up on some meds to help my mental health, they started me on MAT with suboxone, and I was set up on the outside with my psychiatrist, a suboxone clinic, and a referral to a local IOP for rehab.

That good feeling lasted until the second I was discharged.

For context, I’ve never had a good relationship with my parents, and I have a lot of trauma from my childhood and my 3 year relationship with my ex. My mom sat by and allowed my step dad to do whatever he wanted to me, while telling me I was a liar and crazy when I’d try to tell her or family or the courts what was happening to me. He was emotionally, psychologically, verbally, physically, and sexually abusive (and so was my ex, but I’m not talking about him in this post). My mom even introduced me to drugs and alcohol as a coping mechanism when I was 15. Both my parents always have and always will choose their relationships over me. My grandma (dad’s mom) got custody of me and raised me like her own daughter, and she was my best friend. She passed away late last year, and my dad got stuck with me.

I have some “special needs” and I’m not able to function like a “normal 23 year old woman” as my parents like to think. Neither of them raised me or spent much time around me growing up. They considered me spoiled by my grandma, but never believed that I need help and support, lots of meds and lots of doctors appointments, to get by. Once my dad became the only person I have (and he would really NOT like to be that person), my mental health hit rock bottom. There was no more support or encouragement, no more medicines or doctors appointments. Then he wondered why I stayed in my room and slept all day. He just puts me down and tells me how depressed he is because of me, how embarrassing I am to him. When my grandma was alive, she loved my dad so much and I saw him the same way she saw him, a selfless man who loved me deeply and would do anything for us. But that love only extended to his mom, I guess I just assumed he felt the same way about me. But he proved me wrong.

Dealing with both my parents fighting with each other over who has to have me, feeling extremely unwanted, not getting the medical attention I need - I feel desperate for it to stop. I keep thinking about how easy it would be to overdose on heroin, how I would be doing my family a favor so they can stop arguing over me, and can live their lives the way they want to.

Today after I asked a random question about the internet, my dad dropped on me that he’s going to be turning it off because he’s moving next month and he’s getting ready to start packing. I guess he just wasn’t going to tell me. I asked him where I will go, he just said “I don’t know” and “I’m tired of being used”. I never meant for my needs to make anyone feel used. I wish I didn’t have these special needs and that I could take care of myself - and I feel like with someone taking care of my special needs and being an encouraging support system, one day I could reach the ability to take care of myself safely and successfully. It doesn’t matter how many times I try to explain it. They didn’t want to parent me then, they certainly don’t want to parent me now.

My only hope was that my boyfriend (we’re LDR) had found an apartment for us and was working on getting it secured for us and getting me and my stuff down there. But it was going to take a bit of time...and now I don’t have that. I don’t think his parents would allow us to stay there until the apartment is ours. So I’m not sure what to do. I’m really not.

I just think me not being around would be a relief for everyone. The only person I can imagine being hurt would be my boyfriend, but...I can’t help but feel like, we don’t see each other in person often at all, it could only hurt but so bad, right? And I think of all the people I would be helping by being gone, and the pros seem to outweigh the cons.

I don’t know. I guess I don’t feel like I’m in immediate crisis and need to go to the hospital (I literally just got out and know going back won’t do any more good), but I have been sitting around contemplating it and I think I’m definitely leaning towards one option over the other. It just feels like the right thing to do. I just want my parents to be happy. I’ve always been their burden, the thing they want to hide. My mom has my sister and pretends she only had one child, my dad just avoids the subject. Even though my grandma told me they had wanted a baby - apparently they had me on purpose - I can’t help but think I somehow wasn’t what they wanted or expected, and for that I will always feel guilty.",1

"Just witnessed my brother spewing and exhibiting typical suicidal behavior and statements. Need help.Hey everyone. I'm not sure if this is the right place for me to post this, but bear with me. If the title hasn't caught your attention, then perhaps reading this post will. Just moments ago, I witnessed my brother act in an erratic manner to the point where he was spewing unpleasant phrases such as ""I'm going to kill myself, I don't know who I am anymore, I hate this place"", you get the picture. I tried calming him down and all seem to go well to the point where he handed me all the sharp objects he could and told me to hide them in the place he could never find them. I did as instructed, but secretly, I knew that this could be the last time I see him alive. He told me he was going to bed, and that to not call the cops, wake up my parents, or do anything ""stupid"" so as to not cause a scene or else he was really going to do it, whether in custody or not. I know he has no intentions of harming me, or else he would have already done it. I couldn't bear the thought of him also getting taken away, never to be seen again from me or my family. As I write this now, he's in his room doing God knows what and I won't attempt to console him any further since he's pleaded that he's fine and that doing anything to calm him down isn't going to work. I have contemplated calling the authorities, but at this moment, my fear and anxiety have taken over and I've resorted to just letting events unfold. 

&amp;#x200B;

To those of you wondering, at the current time of me writing this, things have calmed down. There is no need for worry, for I intend on staying awake for as long and as best as I can hoping for all the best. If it really concerns any of you who are reading this, I'll be sure to update you all on things as they go. But for now, what should I do? I have never experienced this before, and it's so traumatizing.",1
"I'm only alive because I don't want to hurt my parents.But they don't realise I need help. My father thinks that depressed people are trash and losers, the weak type. My mother thinks that ""it's just a phase"". I lost all my motivation to do anything. I exist because I'm forced to do so. Today, when I casually approached my father and said sth like ""man, I'm fed up with maths. I just can't understand the stuff."". All he did was tell me I'm lazy and a money pit. He said that the extra math lessons he pays for are useless since I'm too lazy to work. He told my mother that he's fed up with me and that he wishes I wasn't like I am. My will to live is not existent. It's been like this for about 6 months and I can't fucking take it anymore. I disappointed my parents. I almost died from alcohol OD (I'm 16), trying to impress people that I thought would be the cure to my depression. I love a girl, but I'm too shy to ask her out (and she's an ex of my very good friend, he still loves her AFAIK). No one wants to chat with me. 95% of the snaps I get are ""streaks"". I have acne which I can't do shit about, and even though my parents promised to take me to the dermatologist they don't care and keep forgetting about this, even though I keep asking for it. My father is going crazy about my marks. At first he told me to pay attention to only math and physics, which are the leading subjects in my class, but now he is showing disgust whenever I get a bad mark. I lack contact with girls my age. There are some willing to talk with me from time to time, but they never want to chat with me online (probably consider this as a waste of time). My ""male"" friends don't really care about me. There are 2, maybe 3 people paying attention but that's all. I'm feeling lonely. I'm constantly arguing with my younger brother, feel like my parents don't care about me and I'm just there to make their lives more challenging. I lost appetite, I have to force food into myself. Especially in the mornings. Nothing is working out for me. I'm training to get the Private Pilot License, which my father paid for, but he treats it as a way to tell me that I'm way too fucking expensive. What's more, the airplane got stuck in maintenance and bad weather so I haven't flown in over a month. When flying I always have a smile on my face and it helped me forget about my depression at least on the weekends, but now, especially with how my father treats it, I'm no longer excited to fly. I want to die so fucking bad, that's all I want. I wish I just lost consciousness and hit my head hard on something so it will look like an accident. I want to be killed by a car. Basically anything that would look like an accident. If it wasn't for my parents, I would have killed myself a long time ago, but now when our relations are going to think, I just want to scream. I'm overflowing with emotions. There's a tornado going on inside my mind.
If that matters, I'm 16. Sorry if it's chaotic and hard to read. I'm just not able to concentrate ",1
"Goodbye, againI'm here again to write a post that supposedly is my last. I'm tired of doing this so many times. But actually, everytime feels like the last time, and I wish it was. I hope one day I'll say that it's the last time and it actually will be. I hope today is this day.

I feel guilty about leaving the people that I care about, that I remember, that I live with. My friends, my family. I wish they didn't suffer, they didn't have to feel bad. I wish I was just erased from their memories.

I don't want to hurt anyone. I don't care about me, but I want everyone else to be okay, to be fine

And I'm sorry. I'm sorry for leaving that people that I'll hurt. I'm so, so sorry. But I can't do it anymore.

I love the people that I met here. Even if we just talked for one time, I'm really thankful and I'm happy we did. You really helped me, and I hope I could help you too, somehow.

I feel guilty and sad now, but I hope that when I go to bed, I just feel numb, because it would make everything easier.

Sometimes I have a quick feeling that I souldn't do it, that I should tell someone, that I should stay here to listen to my favorite's band new album, to watch a class with that funny teacher, to eat noodles again. I feel that I should stay here for the little and the big things. But it vanishes quickly as it comes. I don't want to do any of these things. I don't want to be here to do it. And it won't make any difference, because I won't feel anything anymore.

I just want everything to stop. But I'm scared.

I'm pretty sure there's no way back from this method that I'm using, but if it happens for some reason, I don't think I will ever recover, and I'll just hurt everyone more and I'll be a bigger burden for them.

I'm scared from the pain, I'm scared that my parents won't find my notes, I'm scared they will blame themselves.

I'm scared and sad. But more than anything, I'm tired. I want it to end forever.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sorry if you read this untill here. And I'm glad too. You made me feel a little bit more real, for sure.

I feel that now. Not some pushed attempt or an angered one. A genuine one. One where I know for a fact it will succeed. One where I will never have to suffer again.

"British school lunches ""Thy nourishment is thy sustenance"" â€” William Shakespeare

Not only is the food served at my school unhealthy, we have to gobble it up so we can't even digest that junk properly.

The consumption of dry and greasy wedges is a time-consuming process, especially if you don't want to get cancer and you meticulously remove the burnt parts. Furthermore, you have to factor in the initial time needed to mentally prepare yourself for what you're about to go through.

Even though I have my meals in monastic silence, I'm always the last one to finish. Many a time I arrive at class the following period while still chewing. On the other hand, my peers have elaborate conversations about whatever newfangled claptrap is currently popular and after five minutes their green plastic trays are already empty.

I have several hypotheses to explain this phenomenon:

* Exercising your jaws during speech increases chewing performance. As a result, the loud alpha male or female eats their food in the least amount of time.
* The others use their cutlery to pulverise the food and then inhale it when they pause for breath between words.
* They eat so messily that a large proportion of the food ends up somewhere like the ceiling fan.

The only guy who brings lunch from home and therefore has a different-sized portion eats vinegar crisps sandwiched between two slices of white bread, a diet which I assume has been developed by a professional to meet his unique nutritional needs.

Last but not least, there is an utter lack of hygiene. The older generations complain that we've killed the napkin industry, but they are the ones who don't provide us with any!

I hereby assert that eating is just as important as maths or history and therefore a sufficient amount of time has to be allocated to it.",0

"I’m considering suicide, but I’m too weak to do itIt’s driving me crazy thinking about it all the time",1
"this is it, finally.you may not be by my side by reading this text, but i have to express myself. i am the 16 years old author of two sexual agressions. i did them 1 year ago, and 6 months ago. i see a therapist everytime to help me taking control of my hormones, in vain. i never realised what i was doing, and that nearly killed me. i regrer so much what i did, because i never thought i could ne capable of doing this type of shit i usually fight against. i always did anything i could to save the situationand make the girl feel better, by going to her parents, talking to them and cutting myself to suffer back. the second girl decided to post the story on social media, with putting my name. since this, u have lost all my friends, inclueding my best friends. i also lost the support of my family, and the girl o was i relation with. i wish i had the courage to end my fucking life. i wish i had the courage to jump that fucking bridge. i will go to the highway bridge today. i just don't anything, just death. i can't stand breathing anymore. i want to be that strange fruit. i am a pure failure. i have achieved nothing else but hurting people and myself. i deserve the ultimate liberty, joining the fucking sky. why is there any medicine that can help me. why i have to think about that at 16 years old ? why am i a fucking piece of trash that deserves it's pain ? i have no friends anymore, ma family rejects me, my girlfriend got woth her ex that cheted on her, and now my onmy thoughts are ""you have absolutely nothing to hang to, nothing to live anymore. death inspires you. just jump ans go meet the people that love you, in the sky"". i don't want to be that cringy 14 years old pseudo-depressed man, but listen: each minute i live today is probably the last. i post this message as my last and only way to be listened. i don't fear death, i fear even failing to die. i will call the suicide hotline today. i don't know if we all felt that, but when you feel it is the day you are going to die, it is a very strange feeling. like, finally that day comes. goodbye everyone, take car of the person that you love. nothing can change me today. i am a perverse, a predator, an evil thing that could not control itself at the worst moments. the most cruel thing is that all of what happens is deserved, and i can do nothing ti change it. anyway, if i jump today, it's for the sake of the people that know me, my family, and the earth. a criminal less on earth.
if i pass away, just remember me for the person i wanted to be, a good person that shares love. destiny decided in another way, i can't control that.
i can't believe this moment is real.
have a nice day.

(update 3 hours later: i went to the highway bridge and wrote my letter. nobody stopped to ask me how i was. i was crying at the ground next to the void, and nobody even looked.)",1

"Honestly I just really fucking wish I didn't want to be aliveI just really wish I didn't care about how it would make other people feel. I don't say that in like a romantic out dramatic way, I just really wish I didn't know anyone that cared about me. I wish I didn't worry about how killing myself would make them feel. I don't want to do this anymore and I honestly can't figure out any other solution. I hate that my brain wants me to keep living. I wish I didn't have that urge to live so I could just finally go through with it. It makes me so fucking mad that I'm the only one holding myself back at this point even though all I have left to live for is pain. Why should I want to be alive? There's nothing here for me. I hate that even in the midst of thinking about how to end it all I still feel so much shame. I just want to let go and I can't stop stopping myself.",1
"hey guys i just made this account!i made this account with the utmost of privacy because i can't be found out... maybe i hope someone connects the dots? i don't know.   
anyways; i've been dealing with a lot of hopelessness; i'm scared to admit it to anyone because i have to ""be a man"". this virus has closed so many doors for me; my problems are so minuscule compared to what i've read on here, i just wanted to ask you guys:  


What if i never find out why i was born? 

i've been trying to find something i'm good at; a passion, a talent, something i can say i do with pride, something i can stop disappointing people at. i've looked everywhere to try and see how i can know what i might be good at; i've done personality quizzes, i've done ""future career"" quizzes but none of them lead me to anything. i'm at the last straw; can someone here help?",1

"I give upI give up. I’m so stressed of everything, and my mom doesn’t help me. She just stresses me more, and I can’t take it anymore. She doesn’t even care about my mental health, only my grades. I just wanna die, just wanna disappear. The only person I love is my dad. Now I’m regretting everything. I don’t know. I’m so confused. I don’t know what to do. I wish I wasn’t born. I wish I could just be my cat. I wish I could just disappear.",1

Is life really worth living?Just a general question.,1
I feel immortal because I want to die and I know I won't die anytime soon. So always 100% don't care .. only thing I do is be careful to avoid further suffering.,0

"nothing.i have no one. everyone i thought was there left me. am i guilty of pushing people away? maybe. my dad doesn’t give a damn about me. im a 23 year old teenager when he and my stepmother come to mind. i do not like them. i would not care if they died. they played huge, huge factors in my mental being ruined intentionally (on her part) after my mom died at 10, and never showed remorse. i was always told to “quit mopping around” when i was 11 -12 by them. couldnt even grieve. went through my teens confused, im bisexual and i wouldn’t dare tell anyone. id really be shunned from the only 2 people in my life, my grandma and uncle. all my friends left me over the last two years. i have no close relatives outside my uncle and grandmother. 
i have no one. everyone i thought was there left me. 
i know for a fact i played a part in those who left me lonely. 
how can they stomach me wanting to die, constantly complaining about not having a purpose daily?
how can they stomach suicide y’all and someone with a negative outlook, someone with an eternal dark cloud over them? 
i made the closest friends of my life, (at least i thought) in my short stint in the military. 
we shared stresses. pain. 
i never connected with anyone in my life like I did with these guys. and it ended like everything else. im so use to loss. my anxiety has only gotten worse and my suicide hotline profile has only grown this year. ive never been so lonely, yet so numb to the pain of it. 
all while knowing many people would love it if i killed myself right now. this year has been very hard. my fears have heightened. i spit on the ground as a cop passed one day, and now i just believe he took it and might frame me for something. my mind is everywhere and i have no one to turn to but a hotline. 
i know it ends bad for me. 
i know there will be celebrations. 
i know i can’t save me from myself.",1
"Never cheat on your soulmateTwo years ago i cheated on my girlfriend, i Was cuddleing with another woman in bed. No sex or kisses, still not okey. 

She still decided to be with me, she cries all the time still thinking about it.

Now it looks like she had enough and will probably leave me any day now

We both love eachother so much. But she cant take the pain. I Never believed in the term ”soulmate” before i met her and now i have fucked up everything in my life.

If/When she leaves me i dont want to live anymore, i Really just want the easiest most painless death i can get. So ashamed that i will make her even more sad from me doing suicide, and i feel so sad for my family and friends. Life is 0 without her. She is my best friend since i Was 13 years old and now i will lose her forever",1
opinions on this type of relationship A friend(f15) of mine has recently became interested in a guy (m18). She said he is super sweet and funny but I think it is a little weird. She told him she liked him and he told her he liked her back. I just feel like its kind of weird but at the same time I guess its okay as long as they aren't doing stuff. I don't know I guess I just wanted to know what you homies thought of this.,0
"That's it, I'm doneI f*cking hate everyone, every single person. I disgust human beings. I study medicine and honestly, I don't give two fucks about people's lives. Why would I? Nobody gives a fuck about me. I hope all people burn to death. I am resentful. I deserve to die. I wasn't built for human society. Better to check myself out before I accidentally(?) kill someone.",1
"Im not even sadI'm not upset or distraught, I don't feel in distress or like the world around me is crumbling. I just don't want to live. I love my family and my friends, they make me happy, and when I'm with them I am perfectly capable of being alive. But when I'm alone, allowed to think, when my brain only has itself I can only think about death. I feel so effortlessly suicidal, as if it would be as simple as making a sandwich. I wanna die. No matter how I think about it, how selfish it is and how unfair to my loved ones, I just can't imagine having to continue this ridiculous cycle of living because I was forcibly given this ""gift"" of life. I hate it. It sucks. MY life doesn't suck, it's great. I'm just tired of living.",1

"Blissful silenceLet me start with i have never been good at grammar or emotions the very thought of having to emotionally connection with people is like trying to learn Chinese from an ikea Manual. I’m one of the people that only “live” 3-6 months in a year. I simply thought “living” was a means to an end like if I’m a good person x and y will happen. I discovered I was wrong, very wrong, so wrong in fact I didnt know if it was worth fixing.i grew up in a household of numbers, if grew up was even the right word. Few quotes have stuck with me as hard as “ just be less like yourself” I remember hearing this and thinking this is great I hate myself so why won’t I want to be like someone else, so I began forming mask. Ezio himself would be proud, I became what I can only call as a shapeshifter. I could blend in any group and as long I wasn’t myself I was happy, or at least the mask was. You can never truly out run your shadow. I discovered very young what hell is , it isn’t the fire and brimstone people think it is at least not to me. My mind became a prison like knowing every answer but no way to tell anyone. I use to dream of sitting in a Room being interrogated by the best version of me, he made better decisions, treating past relationships better, had the courage to allow people inside. Seeing what I could have been compared to what I am, I only have one word , disappointment. The only thing that brings me any happiness was helping others, my thinking was if I can help others then they won’t be as useless as I am. But I just furthered the divide I created my own island, my own prison. I have fully accepted that life or death has nothing to do with a beating heart. I died long ago the whispers of a ghost long forgotten in the walls of an empty house. The more I try to help the more I realize I can’t help myself. I yearn for blissful silence",1
